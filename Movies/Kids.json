With his entire existence pivoting around drugs, skateboarding, and his repugnant theory about sex, swaggering 17-year-old layabout Telly lives like there's no tomorrow. Now, a wide-eyed 12-year-old virgin has agreed to have sex with him. But the smooth-talking Casanova is unaware that, in the hunt for the next victim, sex is a weapon. And then, an unsuspecting former lover accidentally discovers she is HIV positive. As the hapless teenager embarks on a pointless, 24-hour mission to track down the pubescent hedonist before another na\u00efve pre-teen virgin falls prey to his unsettling sexual appetite, questions arise. What do girls see in Telly? Is this desperate quest to stop the shameless liar a case of too little, too late?\u2014Nick Riganas",
