    "description": "On the run and hiding in the deep forests of German-occupied Poland and Belorussia (World War II), the four Bielski brothers assist a large community of Jewish refugees and then face the almost impossible task of foraging for food and weapons required for survival over the winter. Led by Tuvia Bielski, the community hides in fear of discovery, contending with neighboring Soviet partisans and unsure whom to trust. People of all ages work to survive, building makeshift homes in the dark, cold and unforgiving forests. They develop relationships, struggle with fear and uncertainty, and manage internal dissent. As Zus Bielski joins the Soviet Partisans, the brothers become part of a larger effort to defeat the Nazis.\u2014Cinema_Fan",
