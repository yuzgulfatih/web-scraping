    "description": "Four interlocking stories connected by a single gun converge at the end to reveal a complex, tragic story of the lives of humanity around the world and how we truly aren't all that different. In Morocco, a troubled married couple are on vacation trying to work out their differences. Meanwhile, a Moroccan herder buys a rifle for his sons so they can keep the jackals away from his herd. A girl in Japan dealing with rejection, her mother's death, her father's emotional distance, her own self-consciousness, and a disability, deals with modern life in the enormous metropolis of Tokyo, Japan. On the opposite side of the world the married couple's Mexican nanny takes the couple's two children with her to her son's wedding in Mexico, only to meet trouble on the return trip. Combined, it provides a powerful story and an equally-powerful looking glass into the lives of seemingly random people around the world and it shows just how connected we really are.\u2014Mac",
