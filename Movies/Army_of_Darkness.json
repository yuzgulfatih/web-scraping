    "description": "As the unfathomable tentacles of evil spread across time and space, Ash finds himself whisked off to another dimension, right after the supernatural events ofVah\u015fet (1987). Now, trapped in the distant Middle Ages circa 1300 AD, battle-scarred Ash must fight tooth and nail against the same old adversary he confronted in\u015eeytan\u0131n \u00d6l\u00fcs\u00fc (1981). However, this time he is neck-deep in trouble: not one, not two demons, but the entire army of darkness is after Ash, thirsting for his soul. And what's more, there is no turning back. Can the guy with the chainsaw and the 12-gauge double-barreled shotgun blast evil to smithereens and save both worlds from the curse of the mystical Necronomicon?\u2014Nick Riganas",
