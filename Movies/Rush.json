    "description": "Set against the sexy, glamorous golden age of Formula 1 racing in the 1970s, the film is based on the true story of a great sporting rivalry between handsome English playboyJames Hunt(Hemsworth), and his methodical, brilliant opponent, Austrian driverNiki Lauda(Bruhl). The story follows their distinctly-different personal styles on and off the track, their loves, and the astonishing 1976 season in which both drivers were willing to risk everything to become world champion in a sport with no margin for error: if you make a mistake, you die.\u2014P.
