    "description": "Because of his eccentric habits and bafflingly strange films, directorEdward D. Wood Jr.is a Hollywood outcast. Nevertheless, with the help of the formerly famousBela Lugosiand a devoted cast and crew of show-business misfits who believe in Ed's off-kilter vision, the filmmaker is able to bring his oversize dreams to cinematic life.
