    "description": "Mary Horowitz writes crossword puzzles for the Sacramento Herald. She's loquacious to a fault. When kids at a Career Day make fun of her for being single, she accepts a blind date with Steve, the cameraman for a CNN-like news network. Within minutes she decides he's the man for her. Quickly put off by her constant verbiage and over-the-top advances, he makes an off-hand remark about going on the road with her, then splits. Moonstruck, she writes a sappy crossword puzzle, loses her job, and decides to follow him as the news team crisscrosses the Southwest; Steve's team eggs her on. Then she falls into a mine shaft, and she and Steve become a story. It a love story?\u2014<jhailey@hotmail.com>",
