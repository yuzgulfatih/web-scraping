    "description": "An exploration of how completely different the television series is from the film. The cast and filmmakers underwent quite a change in order to create the film X Files, The (1998). We are also given a breakdown of how the Texas explosion was conceived and put together. This is a fairly enjoyable piece to watch, what with several interesting and funny interviews with the cast and crew.\u2014Rhyl Donnelly",
