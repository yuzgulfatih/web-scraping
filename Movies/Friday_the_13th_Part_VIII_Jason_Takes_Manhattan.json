Jason has boarded the ship and starts his killing rampage until only the main characters are left. After that, they decide to look for the killer and kill him. Unfortunately, Jason gets them first. After only a few of them escape and the ship reaches New York, they discover that Jason got there first and is ready to pursue the survivors so he can kill them. Now a young teenage couple must escape or die in the dark waters of New York.\u2014manuel15_jesus@hotmail.com",
