    "description": "With madness in his eyes, a shotgun-toting man storms into a dusty desert bar in the middle of nowhere. Drenched in blood, the mysterious stranger and his wife start speaking of unnoticed, unstoppable creatures preying in the dark, trying to warn everyone of the impending danger. Now, the ravenous monsters desperately want in. As the pitiless entities draw first blood, the utterly unprepared regulars realise that, in the face of impossible odds, there's not enough ammo in the world to stop the fanged intruders. Will they survive the night? Who will be the next course in the monsters' feast?\u2014Nick Riganas",
