    "description": "A biographical film on the late comedianAndy Kaufman. Kaufman, along with his role onTaxi (1978), was famous for being the self-declared Intergender Wrestling Champion of the world. After beating women time and time again,Jerry Lawler(who plays himself in the movie), a professional wrestler, got tired of seeing all of this and decided to challenge Kaufman to a match. In most of the matches the two had, Lawler prevailed with the piledriver, which is a move by spiking an opponent head-first into the mat. One of the most famous moments in this feud was in the early 80s when Kaufman threw coffee on Lawler on [error], got into fisticuffs with Lawler, and proceeded to sue NBC.\u2014Eli Boorstein <uahp@rocketmail.com>",
