        "Rochefort": "Throw it on the fire with everything else.  The Musketeers no longer exist. Or haven't you heard? Throw it on the fire.  Musketeers...  By joint edict of His Majesty King Louis XIII and His Eminence Cardinal Richelieu, the Musketeers are officially disbanded. In preparation for the coming war with England, your ranks and commissions are hereby transferred to the Infantry. You will be contacted and told where to report. Until that time, you are instructed to return to your homes.  The Cardinal's Guards are more than capable of assuming that... responsibility.  You are hereby ordered to disperse. Should even one of you resist... the entire corps will be arrested and imprisoned. 'All for one, and one for all.'  He returns to the adjoining room where Jussac stands by. Rochefort has enjoyed himself immensely. He goes to a mirror and preens, adjusting his eye patch to a more rak- ish angle. That's when he catches a glimpse of something behind him. Something red. Rochefort turns. a tall, powerfully built MAN stands in the shadows of the room, a spectre in red.  Your Eminence.    I'll take those tunics, Musketeers.  You ought to know. Three witnesses stood against me.  You are hereby ordered to surrender your commissions and make yourselves available for reassignment in the King's Army.  You will become outlaws.   Hunted men.  Are you refusing to serve your King?  I'll tell him you said that.  I'll make sure His Emminence the Cardinal gets the message. But I can't promise he'll be pleased.  He's a foolish boy. And barely that.  (reacts, knows what    (shouts to the  It's magnificent. Where did you get it?  Your father...  Well now it belongs to me. I collect swords. I take them from the men I kill.  Soon enough.  I'll give you a hint. It's not the Louvre.  Well, you're the first person who was ever happy to be here. Unfortunately, your visit will be a short one.  You killed one of the Cardinal's Guards. An offense punishable by death.  Also punishable by death.  You know them?  The Musketeers.  Tell me where they are, and I will be lenient.    Fool.   Like your father.  You're going to go through with ... everything?  On your knees.  This is the boy who killed Jussac.  Silence!  They'll be dead by dawn.  Milady left at midnight.   By private coach.  He's wishing he'd never heard of the Musketeers.    I told you not to worry about the Musketeers. They are dead by now.  The King's birthday celebration...?  And our plans...?  He can do it every time.  None. He believes that man should honor no Kings before God.  Yes, Your Eminence.  I'd stake my life on it, Your Eminence.  Not for long.  By all means. Let's discover if you are as brave a man as your father was. And as foolish.  He died for his King and for France. But most of all... he died on the end of my sword. As will you.     One thing's certain. You're no Musketeer.  I might... have been... mistaken.",

        "Aramis": "Athos -- is that any way to greet our guests?  Don't be shy, gentlemen. Come in. Your friends have been expecting you.  Or the Cardinal.  (with an edge  We can't refuse Rochefort's invitation. It would be impolite.  Congratulations, Porthos.   You brought down the house.  He said he'll take those tunics.  Conduct Unbecoming a Musketeer. Wasn't that the charge?  We are refusing to serve the Cardinal.  France has one King too many.  Are you going to visit them alphabetically or in order of preference?  When it comes to you and women, fairness rarely applies.  Citizens of France.  Madam, I'm flattered but I thought you wanted me to tutor you in theology.  There's nothing unholy about expressing one's emotions. On the contrary. Religion should be experienced in a passionate, all- embracing way. We should feel free to express our spirituality.  Your husband!?  First we must pray to God for forgiveness.  On second thought, God's often busy.  Thanks. You broke my fall perfectly. But I do apologize for the inconvenience...  If there's one thing I can't abide, it's rudeness.  And I apologized for it.  I'd be honored.  If that's where you wish to die, I won't disappoint you. Until then...    Jussac.   Again.  It hardly seems fair. Let's give them the chance to surrender.  A poet.  Impossible.  They are nearer to God...  Pagan.  I'm fine, thank you.  Take a look at our young friend.  Don't encourage him. By killing Jussac, the boy's made himself an outlaw too.  I know Athos may seem cold and unfriendly, but don't let that fool you.  But he's also right. This is our fight, not yours. Go on, get out of here.  You can't just leave him.  He has a plan.  All for one, and one for all...  The good father is... all tied up.  Hello.  How is it that a man of God becomes a man of gold?  Let's share.  Would you be so good as to distribute these? Your generosity will be greatly appreciated.    Ten!  Your trip from home has been an eventful one.  A good man, I'm told.  D'Artagnan.  A man is better measured by his life than by his death. Your father was bold, and brave.  He lives in you.  I was orphaned at a young age. The church took me in.  But I did. He was a great man, a leader of the church. And his example inspired me to dedicate my life to God's service.  I was a fool. This great man, this father, betrayed the church, and turned his back on God. To worship power and gold.    I joined the Musketeers and a strange thing happened. I got my faith back.    What?  He rules England the way Richelieu rules France. A ship called the Persephone waits for the Cardinal's agent at Calais. To take him to England. Tuesday, midnight.    Gentlemen, I beg you. Please put away your weapons and remove these kegs from the road. We'd prefer to ride on without having to kill you.    I think we've found a home.  It's hard to believe they haven't heard of the great Porthos.  Only if you don't know which words to say.  Words may make a more lasting impression than a thousand of Porthos' kisses.  I'll demonstrate. Please.   Sit beside me.

One, two -- three!  A nice relaxing boat ride...    The treaty outlines Richelieu's plan to forge an alliance with Buckingham.  He is not mentioned directly. But the agreement is contingent on a 'demonstration' of the Cardinal's power.  I don't know.  I am the resurrection and the life, sayeth the Lord. He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die...  Amen.  D'Artagnan.   Kill him where he stands.

        "Athos": "A private party. Go away.  The Cyclops is a Captain? He must've made a pact with the Devil.  What's the difference?  These gentlemen made a similar request.  Probably. But I'll leave it up to my companions. Aramis?  And what do you say, Porthos?  Now.   About those tunics...  I was trying to remember the last time I saw you here. I know. It was the day you were kicked out of the Musketeers.  It was the least we could do.  And if we refuse?  Do that, Rochefort. Tell his Emminence the Cardinal that we will continue to perform our sworn duty to protect the King. From enemies across the sea.  From traitors who sit at his right hand. And tell him that he can take away our tunics, our muskets, even our swords. But he cannot stop us from being what we are. Musketeers.     The three Musketeers.

I mean the Musketeers have been disbanded. Feel free to poke around for souvenirs.  Some nonsense about being needed in the army. Now if you'll excuse me...  I'd say you've got a problem.  You could use a lesson in manners.  I'm in a hurry now -- but I'll meet you at the Carmes-Deshaux monastery at noon.  Ten minutes early.  You'll miss it, I'm afraid.  I asked two of my friends to act as seconds, but they are not as punctual.  Don't worry. I fight just as well with my left hand.  Thanks, but I see my seconds coming now.  Why not?    You've been... busy.    I told you the next time we met I'd want an answer. But I didn't expect you so soon.  This is not your fight.    You're not a Musketeer.  Have you got a name, boy?  Athos... Porthos... Aramis.  The Cardinal's Guards.  You mean he's still alive?  Last rites. Aramis takes death very seriously.  Not if he leaves Paris. Which is exactly what he's going to do.  Because I do not want you to.  Wake up, boy.    The Musketeers are just a dream.    (the usual dour  Hold on!  You know I prefer wine.  Turn right at the next street.  Turn.

Stay on your horse.  Don't worry.   We'll help him.  Mine was taller.  See to our horses and bring us some food.    You fight like a Musketeer. Let's see if you can drink like one.  Famous last words. What shall we drink to?  Love. Would you like to hear a story, d'Artagnan? A love story?  I once knew a man... one of the Counts of Berry. My native province. When the good Count was about your age, he fell in love with a visitor from Paris. A breathtaking girl of seventeen. She was more than beautiful, d'Artagnan. She was... intoxicating. And this man, the poor idiot, he married her.     On her her arm, the woman wore a gold band in the shape of a serpent. It was the only article of clothing she refused to remove. The Count's curiosity got the best of him. He reached over and slid down the gold band. He saw something on her arm... something she'd kept hidden 'til then...  The fleur d'lis. She'd been branded...  The Count's angel turned out to be a murderess who escaped the Executioner's blade. She swore that she loved him. Swore that she had changed. And if he would just keep her secret, they would live a long life together.  But the Count was young and he was stupid. He was tormented by the ridicule of his social class. And so he rejected her. For her lies and for her past. And turned her over to the authorities to be executed for the crime.  But you see... his heart did not agree.  The Count soon realized what she had meant to him. And what he had done.  That his... betrayal was far greater than her own. Soon after he foreswore the society that shaped him. Gave up his title. And was never seen again.  He killed her. It seemed like the same thing after a while.  Good.   More for me.  Only if I can lead.  Well?    Stay with us, and you just might get your wish.  Split in half! D'Artagnan rides with me!  Or hell!  They'll catch up eventually.  Well. You have your boyhood wish at last. The dark forest. The thrill of the hunt. The nearness of death.  I just wanted to save you from the life of a Musketeer. You don't have to go looking for experience, d'Artagnan. It'll find you soon enough. And when it does -- it will mark you forever.  I'll hold them off for as long as I can. Go on without me.  Ride to Calais and stop the Cardinal's agent.  Go, or I'll kill you myself.  You're insane.  All right. I'll toss a coin. Tails I stay, heads you remain. Agreed?  Heads. D'Artagnan is to remain.       Athos looks up without missing a beat.  Tails.    I stay.    Go!  Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything?  Keep your mind on the mission, d'Artagnan.  Boy, it's a miracle you're still alive fighting like that.  First, always find your enemy's weakness. Second, take advantage of it. Watch me.  Did you find the Cardinal's spy?  Did you kill him?  What?  No.  Stop!!  How did you do it, Sabine? How did you come back from the dead?  I did not.  Give me the Cardinal's treaty.  Then I will shoot.  I know someone who does.  I'd like a word with your prisoner.  No.  I could not give it, Sabine. I was... a fool.  Did you kill his brother and his father as he says?  But not before. Not us.  Do you know the Cardinal's plans?  Tell me.  I can't.  Sabine. You'll die for your crimes. Nothing can stop that. But how you leave this world is up to you.  Die in peace.  No.  Forgive me, Sabine.       Please forgive.  Musketeers.  The King's life in danger.   We have work to do.    Go!  Save the King!!  Greetings, Monsieur Cyclops.   Are we interrupting?

He dashes through a muddy puddle -- spraying foul water all over Porthos where he stands. D'Artagnan doesn't notice, a huge cart loaded with wine barrels has rolled INTO VIEW, blocking the lane. Fellow travelers shout complaints, the cart driver shakes his head, makes an obscene gesture. It's a Seventeenth Century traffic jam. D'Artagnan sees Anne and Constance dismount in the dis- tance, tie their horses, and step into an alley. A man waits in the shadows to escort them. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, he means to continue his pursuit on foot. But he takes two quick steps, and... runs directly into Porthos' outstretched hand.  No.  There is no Queen of America.

Would you please stop whistling?  Well someone is.  I'm beginning to wish the Cardinal had chopped if off.  Do you think we've lost them?  My father used to hunt in a forest like this. He promised to take me on my tenth birthday. I don't know why he picked that year. Something about a boy becoming a man. I'd lay in bed at night and imagine it, just the two of us. But he died before I could go with him.  I'd be proud to die for my King.  I can't leave you here. Not like this.  Athos... I can't.  A duel then.  We never finished the first.  But...?

Allow me to introduce myself. I'm the Musketeer they call Porthos.    Oh, shut up, Aramis.  I don't get it. I just don't get it.  I said, 'A Queen is no different than a barmaid in the dark. Though less... practiced in the arts of pleasure...'  If you're going to be a proper Musketeer, you'll have to learn the manly art of wenching. Right, ladies?  Ahh, very good. Your first subject. But you'll need instruction. Watch closely.  The secret to wenching is the first kiss. For in that kiss, a lasting impression is made. If it is weak, she will think you are weak. And if it is comical, she will think you are a clown. With me?  Very good.   And as a Musketeer is never weak,  and only rarely a clown, your  first kiss must be all the things  that you are. Like this...  You may speak first if you like, your name, her name, an endearment or two. But words are usually a waste of time.  That's cheating.  Come on, d'Artagnan. We haven't got all night.  The boy's a natural.  Athos takes his drinking seriously. Ignore him. He'll be his usual warm, charming self by morning. Service! My lap is cold!  Aramis -- play something with some blood in it! I feel like dancing!  Care to dance, Athos?  Aramis!   Athos made a joke!  Beautiful morning, eh, d'Artagnan?  You know,   d'Artagnan, it's not a good idea   to travel on an empty stomach.    You really should have had a big   portion of those sheep's brains...  Whistling?   I'm not whistling.    I hate cannon balls.  And you?  Here's just the thing.     A nice, relaxing boat ride.  What?  We sail!  Popularity has its price.  We'd be happy to.  If you'll drink one with us to the King.  All right.   I'll object.  Let's see. You are, by your dress and by your manner, members of a bone-lazy class of servile ninnyhammers whose slavish allegiance to His Eminence the Cardinal is as that of a dog who likes nothing better than to sniff today where he has peed the day before.    I was momentarily inspired.  Maybe there's something  about us that just pisses people  off. At least I'd like to think  so. It's too bad we can only kill  them once.  I've been called a lot of things in my time...  But beef-witted is a little more than I can stand, not to mention unfair...  What?  (doesn't like the  But...?  No, no.   Please. After you.  One, two -- three!  Well I certainly hope so. After all that hard work.  Remind me to tell you the story of horses that could fly above raging waters. A heroic tale of love, death, and Musketeers. Suitable for the general public.  All right then. All those who wish to die, raise your hands! Don't by shy, there's plenty to go around!  I told you I was famous.  Privateer.   There's a difference.  What about the King?  Athos --  His name's d'Artagnan, Sire.  Do my eyes deceive me?  His lips, unused as they are to such a contortion, twisted and stretched... into a smile.  Truth... honor...  Weren't you listening?"

    "description": "After failing to steal Leonardo Da Vinci's airship blueprints, the Musketeers are disbanded by Cardinal Richeliu, leaving Athos, Porthos, and Aramis on the streets of Paris. In the meantime, young, reckless, ambitious D'Artagnan has set off from Gascony with dreams of becoming a Musketeer himself, not realizing that they have been disbanded. In no time, D'Artagnan manages to offend Athos, Porthos, and Aramis on different occasions and challenges them all to duels. But before the duels can take place they are attacked by guards who try to arrest them for illegal dueling. The ex-Musketeers and D'Artagnan fight off the soldiers, leading to the four men becoming a band with the motto of \"All for one and one for all\". Count Richelieu is not only determined to be rid of the Musketeers, but also schemes with Athos' former lover Milady to undermine the reign of King Louis and his wife. The Musketeers and D'Artagnan are determined to save the Royal Family and France itself.—WellardRockard",
