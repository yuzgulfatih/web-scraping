        "Smiley": "Have I time to change?      Are we going far?  Oh, I think I manage pretty well, thank you.  Very well.  Very bonny...    I am retired, Oliver.  No.  What did you say to him?    No, we never did.         Control lived with his sister didn't he?  We're only looking for short term rentals. Within the last year.  How long was H. Staunton a tenant?       Thank you. Anywhere will do.    I want to see the records of staff recently retired. While you're there get the handbook on staff duties... and the diagram of the Circus's reorganization under Alleline...           I know that car.  Not much, I'm afraid. We were just discussing the departure of Connie Sachs. I wonder how Research manages without her.  That was one of her talents.    Yes, I suppose I am. Perhaps that's what we have to become? A little paranoid?    Yes. Yes, he did.  Control was out. And Alleline was in. Thanks to...  ... Alleline's \"special source.\"  Everything is connected.  Return to Oxford please.             You left the Circus shortly after I retired...    Which bone?  Polyakov.  Stationed where?  Esterhase said that?  But you disagreed?    What did you do?  What did they say?               If it's genuine it's gold-dust. But its topicality makes it suspect.  Where does it come from? What's the access?  But how could he possibly have access to...?             Yes.  Request for a thousand pound's in cash from the reptile fund.  For a Mister Ellis.  It was one of Jim Prideaux's work names.  The date. Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago. October twenty first. So why was  someone giving him a thousand pounds two months later?             Hello, Ricki.  You missed a wedge.  Where've you been, Ricki?  Who is?  I'm going to try. How long have you been here?  I wouldn't use my home as a safe house. There's every chance they're watching it.  What do you want Ricki?  What woman?     You were due to fly home the next day. What did you tell London?  Sense what?     What made you so sure she wasn't coat-trailing?  She had children in Russia?       And what did your message say, Ricki?  What else?  I understand how you felt. You wanted to do something.  Yes. I quite see that.  And what else?  What happened next Ricki?     Where are you going Ricki? You said yourself, Karla will be looking for you. I can take you somewhere. Keep you safe.  (grateful to get away  Yes. I didn't sleep well. I want you to get something for me, Peter. I need the duty officer's log book for last November. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to send you up a floor, into the Lion's den. If you have the slightest reservation...  If you're caught, Peter, you can't mention me. I'm sorry, but you're alone.  Ricki's been helping us Peter. He's been telling us all about his adventures.  As you did take the trouble to steal it...  Ricki, you said you sent the Circus a telegram concerning Irina's information?  What was the date?  November 20th is missing. Someone is covering their tracks Peter. Unless you think that's just a coincidence?  Thirty thousand isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his Mole. I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mister Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him.  You recognize that handwriting? That's Toby Esterhase.  Secrecy is a habit.      What for?    In fifty-five. Moscow Centre was in pieces. Purge after purge. Half their Agents were jumping ship and I travelled around signing them up. Hundreds of them.  One of them was calling himself Gerstmann. He was on his way back to Russia, and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed. Plane had a twenty-four lay over at Delhi, and that's how long I had to convince him to come over to us instead of going home to die.  Little room...I'm sitting here...he's sitting there...  The Americans have had him tortured.  No fingernails. It's incredibly hot. I'm very tired and all I want to do is get this over with and get back home. Things weren't going well with Ann.  I give him the usual pitch... Come to the West and we can give you a comfortable life. After questioning. Or you can catch your plane and fly home and be shot, like Bykov, Shur, Muranov...    Use my lighter.  \"We could arrange for her to join you, we have a lot of stock to trade. If you go back, she'll be ostracised. Think of her. Think about how much she...\"  Kept harping on about the damn wife! Telling him more about me, than... Should have walked out, of course, but for some reason... it seemed important to save this one.  So I go on. \"Know you're a chain-smoker, help yourself,\" \"We're not so very different you and I..\"    Never said a word. Not one word. Next morning he got back on his plane, gave the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched - this was a chain-smoker, mind - and flew off to what he presumed would be his death. He kept my lighter. It was a gift - \"To George, from Ann. All my love.\"  Yes.  And that's how I know he can be beaten. Because he's a fanatic. And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt.  That's the thing.  I can't remember.  After today, Peter you have to assume they're watching you. If there's anything you need tidied up... now's the time.    You rang my house?  What did you say?  Go on.  The Saville.  Peter...  It's not him, Peter.                           Yes. Pleasant enough.     Which means I was...?  What did you make of it, Jim? Control's theory?  But still you went? Risking your life for a mission you thought was absurd? Why?  Perhaps some part of you wanted to know if Control was right? Wanted to know if there was a Mole, who it might be?  What did you tell them?    What was your last line of defence?  Why?  What else?  Did they ask about me at all?  What did he say about me?    Try and put it all behind you, Jim.  Jim?    He said when he got out, when he was being debriefed at the Nursery, he had a visitor.  Toby Esterhase.  He gave him a thousand pounds. Told him he was dead now and couldn't come back. Had to become a Lotus Eater - forget everything that happened - Control's theory, Tinker, Tailor... all of it.  Yes, that's what I thought. How on earth did Esterhase hear about \"Tinker, Tailor?\"  Will you watch my back, Peter? Look out for a solo. Just a feeling I've had.        Perfectly, Minister.  There is a house, somewhere in this city, where Alleline and the others meet Witchcraft's London representative. I need the address of that house.    I'm glad you take some of the credit.  The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov. You believe his role is to bring information from Witchcraft to you. His real role is to receive information from the Mole to take back to Karla.  Made possible. By you. When he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the Circus, in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for. I'm sure you'll be able to take full credit for that.  Just enough glitter, amongst the chicken-feed. Control didn't believe in miracles and he didn't believe in Witchcraft. But you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in.    You've opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the Americans. What they tell the Circus, they'll be telling the Kremlin. Witchcraft's information, the \"gold\" Karla let you have? It wasn't to lure you. It was to lure the Americans. Now, do you want to take credit for that?  We have one thing the Mole wants.    Keep walking please.  I want to talk about loyalty Toby. Control recruited you when you were trying to escape from Hungary didn't he? A wanted man. Saved you from a KGB bullet, didn't he? And yet, when the time came, when it came to picking sides between him and Alleline, you didn't hesitate? Understandable perhaps, with your war experience. You've survived this long, I suppose, because of your ability to change sides, serve any Master?  It's about which Master you've been serving, Toby.  Intelligence has been leaked, Toby. Someone's been taking files from the Circus...  The files were delivered to a Russian attache, weren't they?  Operation Witchcraft? Yes, I know.  Who gave you the message for Jim to forget about Tinker Tailor?  To get rid of Connie Sachs? Westerby?  You're just the messenger? Running between them all. Anything to serve Witchcraft?  I know all about your secret source. And I know something you don't. I know who he is. He's Karla.  One of you has been giving Polyakov the Crown Jewels.  Are you still a wanted man, Toby?  You picked the wrong side, Toby.  Give me the address. Where do you meet Polyakov?  What are the safety signals?  Where is the mike, Mrs McCraig?  And what's the procedure?  If you're at all worried you can call Lacon from the basement phone. Let's try the tape recorder shall we?        I'm here, Mendel.  I was assured there would be no coercion.  If I can.  Of course.  I did have one or two questions. About Prideaux.  Yes, yes you did. That was good of you.  I'm surprised Karla didn't shoot him. Or do you think he held back out of delicacy towards you?  Did Prideaux come and see you before he left on his Hungarian mission?  To say what?    Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus?  What are you then?    Up to a point.               Shall we begin?",

Andras Benedek, Hungarian journalist based in Paris.  What information?  What else?     You were Beggarman.            Everything.  I held on as long as I could, to give everyone else time to get the hell out of there.  Did they?  My networks in Hungary. Did they get out?  The Mole. Control's crazy theory. I was going to bury that so deep, they'd never get it out of me. Which was a joke.  Because they already knew. They wanted to know how far Control had got in his investigation.  Circus gossip. Was Percy's wife still drinking, who was Bland screwing in the office. That sort of thing.  One of them did.  He had a cigarette lighter. Kept flashing it round for me to see. Showed me the inscription. \"To George, from Ann. All my love.\" He reckoned after Bill's fling with her, she might want to change the inscription.  (Still looking to the  If they had one man like Bill Haydon they could call it set and match!  He gave me a cigarette.  I thought it was my last one.  I don't know her.  Do you know who she was?         I don't want you hanging around here. Keep away from me from now on. Go and join the others.  Just bloody join in. Go and play damn you.",
        "Control": "Smiley is leaving with me.                     Step into my lair.    Report by Soviet High Command on their recent naval exercises in the Black Sea. Just what the Admiralty have been begging us for some information on.  I didn't. Percy and his little cabal walked in with it.  Shut up, Esterhase.  Smiley is suspicious, Percy. Smells a fake.  Percy doesn't feel like telling.  Percy and his pals have bypassed us, Smiley. Gone straight to the Minister. Everyone's very excited. Percy's to be allowed to keep the identity of his new friend top secret.  Luckily Percy's cabal has come to save us.  Your bloody Yanks!     I don't trust miracles.    Percy. Did you do this?

    "description": "In the early 1970s during the Cold War, the head of British Intelligence, Control (Sir John Hurt), resigns after an operation in Budapest, Hungary goes badly wrong. It transpires that Control believed one of four senior figures in the service was in fact a Russian Agent, a mole, and the Hungary operation was an attempt to identify which one it was. George Smiley (Gary Oldman) had been forced into retirement by Control's departure, but is asked by a senior government figure to investigate a story told to him by rogue Agent Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy), that there was a mole. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet Intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding him.—David Brain",
