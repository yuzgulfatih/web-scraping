I'm not a good soldier.             I like to bleed, sir.  Not enough, sir.  They're soldiers, sir.  Like me.  Nothing.  They are obeying orders, sir.  It's their duty.  Seventeen more, sir.

It's Christmas!  Haven't you heard of piece on earth?  \"Piece on earth,\" get it?  Suit up, fellas.  Time to go build another play house.  Yes, Riley, what is it?    You don't even have to salute anymore.  A simple \"Yes, sir\" will do.  Every time it's time to send them out, Riley asks about weapons.  And every time I tell him they don't need weapons anymore, they're not soldiers anymore.  I think you're trying to say a \"wind pain in the ass.\"  No shit!  We're gonna set up a monitor on a garbage dump!  So we can monitor garbage rusting?  A camp!  Jesus Christ!    The civilians? Squatters...refugees. I don't think we want to know, do we?  Speaking of Riley and his old soldiers...why don't we let them start putting up the unit?  It's gonna take forever in this wind.        Double belts, double ammo, double everything!  You've got to be heavy there or you'll blow away, fellas...and we wouldn't want that, would we?  You're afraid of the dark, Sergeant Caine?  That's what nightscopes are for, soldier.  For the dark.     There was...some kind of... guerilla action...  We couldn't get any figures on enemy troop strength.  (panicky, blurting at  Well, Riley, you wanted a weapon, right?  Now you got one!  A real biggee!  Okay, fellas, take it about a hundred yards, then get back on the double...unless you wanna fry.  Fuck 'em!  Let's just go!    Sssshhhh!  Listen!  Like a kid!  Sergeant Todd!     Oh, my God, I can't remember if it's six-seven or seven-six...  There!  I did it!  Did it stop?  Did it -- ?",
        "Caine": "Sir!  Crawler, Crawler to Daddy.  No hostiles!  Crawler to Daddy, Crawler to Daddy. Come in, Daddy!  It's dark now, sir.  No, sir.  But the manual says --  Yes, sir.  But the sixth rule is \"never give the enemy an advantage unnecessarily.\"  If they're expecting us --  Crawler One, do you require assistance?  Roger, One.  We are proceeding to target.  Crawler Two to Crawler One.  Come in, One.  Two to one, take your port to our nine o'clock and commence firing.  Crawler Two to Crawler One.  Again; proceed to port nine...    Gunner, hard to port, target hard to port!                             It hurts!",

If there's any danger to Nathan --  We're teaching the boy to walk.  I got something for you.  Here.  Like this.  See?  Practice with it.  In a day or two maybe you'll be strong enough to go out to the garden with Sandra.  Let's go.  Come on, Sergeant.  Replaced?  She's down now, but she'll come up again.  Always does.    Oh, we're not going to shoot anything.  That's not what we mean by \"hunting.\" Jimmy Pig, you're not going to shoot anything, are you?    Sandra said she told you how we wound up here.  Our parents and so on. Over here, we call these \"catcher trenches.\"    We try to work 'em when they're dry. It's lousy going in there when they're flooded.  You can see...  Whatever looks useful, if we can get a rope to it, we'll go for it.  But you can't ever go further than your safety line because it'll come up on you with sometimes maybe ten seconds or even less.  Like right now.  You hear that?  It's close when you hear that.    Uh, thanks, Sergeant.  Thanks a lot...  Dumpers.  They come every twenty or thirty days.  CHESTER, SALLY, ELLEN, HAWKINS, even SLADE, SINGING. ANGLE ON THE DOOR.  No sign of TODD!  Gone!  There's going to be a meeting. People are upset about him.  That's what scares people.  He gets stronger every day.  I've caught him..sneaking looks at you.  At your body.  Yes. God knows where he's been...or what he's done.  I've never been afraid of anyone before...not this way.  I feel he could break me in half...with no real effort and no real...feeling.  Maybe he is.  It doesn't matter.  We'll give you any tools you need, warm clothing, a good knife, boots.  You're a friend, Sergeant.  It's just...  If you need us...you can ask us for help.  We voted wrong!    Damn!  Thank you, Todd.  God damn! I almost took a... a...swim there!  My...God!  Someone's landing.  Look at that.  It's some kind of vehicle.  A landing party.  HEY!     Oh, shit, Todd...I'm...dead... aren't I?  I'm not going to make it.  Why?  Why?  I'm not..a soldier. A...mistake?  Was it...a mistake?  Oh, my God.  They won't...they won't...?  Not Sandra!  Not... not...Nathan!  Soldiers!  Soldiers... ...deserve...soldiers!",
        "Rubrick": "Colonel Mekum has his \"boys\" unpacked.  I think he wants to show them off.  They look...impressive.  This is Colonel Mekum from Q.  He's their commanding officer.  Very nice, Riley.  Fall away.  Thirty seconds, 90 percent hits.  Ninety-nine percent...    What are we supposed to do with the old soldiers?  At ease, soldier.    Romero, A. -- Goines, D.L. -- up the chains.    Get him, men!  They're...fantastic!  Merry Christmas, everybody.  And some good cheer.    Eat, drink, and be merry, men.  For tomorrow you go on patrol in the \"hostile zone.\"  All right, Crawler, Crawler, we got you.  This is Daddy.  Continue per, over.  We're clear.  We can send a crew out.      Wind!  Will the wind affect the patrol?  People.  They've spotted people!  Two civilians.  Unarmed.  They've killed both of them.  They've spotted smoke from some kind of camp and they're going to check it out.  Not yet.  Who do you think they are?  Report from Crawler One.  Everything under control.  No need for assistance.  Ineffectual.  About fifty disorganized people with almost no fire power.  Three men are going in to clean them out; one man's staying with the Crawler.  Well, he didn't say the word \"growl.\"  He said a \"throat-noise,\" but I asked him to imitate it and it sounded like a growl to me.    We could send reinforcements now...  Uh, what does that mean, \"the hammer\"?      This is Daddy, come in, Number Two. Daddy calling Number Two...  I tried One.  I can't get either one of them.  Then we lost them...  Not even estimates...  (into the mike,  What good'll it do just setting it outside?  We don't know where the enemy is.   Roger.  Right horizontal checks green.  She's right!  Four more casualties aren't gonna mean anything to anybody, especially when they're already obsolete.  It sounds...  Are you crazy?  You can't do this, soldier!  You're going to be in trouble.  Listen, you don't understand!  That bomb is triggered!  It's on a timer!",

        "Mekum": "As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.    That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.  Such as?  Let's make it more difficult.  Caine Six-Oh-Seven!  Assemble the weapon, load, fire on the target from various evasive positions in a thirty-second period.  Starting...now!      See?  Much stronger.     Melton, Eight Five.  Forward.  Ten miles, Melton, on the run.  You've got sixty minutes.  Go.  My man left exactly twenty minutes after yours.  Make a note of that.    They'll serve as a labor force.  You can use them for physical stuff... loading, unloading, repairs, power lines, that kind of thing. Even cleaning...sweeping...,uh, tidying up.  Of course, age is a factor, but the real factor is the training program, especially the psychological.  The mind controls the body after all, and we're doing wonderful things with the mind.  Tired?       Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's all aggression.  You mean up there?  No!  Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.  Go ahead.       Old news!  They're nothing at all! Wait until you get these new fellas into some real action.  I guarantee you'll be awed.  I guarantee it.  Sorry to disturb the tranquillity of outer space on Christmas Eve, but I'm off to the Caribbean in a few hours, and I wanted to make sure you'd got the transmission on the security sweep.       Well, no one's out there, but officially these are \"hostile zones.\"  Therefore you'd be within your rights to classify anyone as \"hostile,\" I think. But I repeat, you should be worried about boredom, not action.  Any other questions before I go?    You can't be serious!  This is some kind of a joke...in poor taste.  Abort?  You want to lose twenty top soldiers to a phantom army and then abort the mission?  Do you know what that would look like on my record? Or yours?  We'd be explaining it for the next fifty years from some goddam assignment in God knows where, we'd --      Nuke the joint...and get out!  ...I need a report, Captain.  It's not just my ass, it's yours too! You've got to stand by me on this. I want you to come in right now... right now!  Do you understand me? Right now!  This is important for all of us, for our careers.  There's going to be a Board of Inquiry and --",
        "Riley": "Sir!    Sir.  We haven't been issued weapons, sir.    Y-yes...sir.  Will we be issued weapons, sir?     Cold.    Aye, aye, sir.",
        "Church": "Hmmmmph.        ...He used to say, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"  (indicating the  The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...  Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...  What about endurance?  Our man has been out there fifteen minutes now.  Shouldn't you send one?  What's the price of all that speed? Is he tired?  Todd here ran the pace he's been taught to run.  He's still strong. Send him up the chain, Rube.  What about...spirit?  Whatever the latest jargon is.   (turning to Mekum,    \"No\"?    Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. \"Training accident.\"  Paperwork.      It was our best man who got his eye...  Todd, a real tough one. Survived police action in Montana, fought in the Argentine Sector, and in the Saudi Campaign to say nothing of --  We got it all right.  This is an outpost here, not the Third Army! You've got us securing thirty-four locations and erecting monitor units in one month and --  What if we do run into people... say squatters or refugees?  Eliminate them, you mean.  Down there...is it snowing?  We brought you a little Christmas tree.  (suddenly serious,    Next one's going to be a real pain in the ass.  How about a \"gaseous currents\" and \"urgent convections\" pain in the ass.  It's a dump.  Literally.  The Crawlers are low enough and heavy enough, they won't blow.  The men should wear armored vests and carry double weapons and ammo for the weight.  They may have to use lines too, like mountain climbers.  \"People\"!  \"People\"?  What do you mean \"people\"?  Damn! Did they ask for assistance?  Like my daddy used to say, \"Nothing's ever as simple as it's supposed to be...except shit.\"  Good point.  There's resistance?  Humph.  Sounds reckless, three against fifty.  The old ones, the veterans, they would have called for support...just in case.  A \"growl\"!  He heard a growl?  My God!  Who are we fighting here!          It may not be heroic, and we may waste some ammo, but by God we'll get the job done.  Whaaaaat?  What about Number One?  Try Number...  You should have waked me sooner! This is bad, very bad.  I never should have let that clown Mekum test his wonder boy army on me.  \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Shit!  We don't even know what we're up against.  How many...?  We're sitting ducks here!  There could be a couple of divisions! More!  We don't even have the weapons to arm the old soldiers.  Not only are we apparently out twenty of your fancy new soldiers, your supermen, we're out both crawlers and all the weapons...so we can't arm the old soldiers, the ones you \"improved\" on, to defend ourselves...      Meaning?  Doesn't matter.  For once Mekum's on the ball. This is a very dirty bomb!  That wind will churn the radioactivity around like soap in a washing machine.  This is gonna be one clean place in a very short time...   Right horizontal?  All right we're \"go.\"  I'm allowing us three minutes to clear the atmosphere and get out of range. That means we can wait seven more minutes.  I guess they wouldn't want to get old anyway. Go ahead, lock the hatch. Rube, punch up the port power cluster and --  Huh?  What was what?  I'm your superior officer, don't you understand that?  Don't you realize you're violating the chain of command?  I'm giving you a direct order to...to...to...  S-sergeant?  S-sergeant T-todd? It...  You...!  How...?  How...?  We have to get out of here!  All of us!  You need us!  You need us to operate the ship...    Twenty seconds.  Hurry.  Try one! Try it!",

        "Sandra": "Want to try some more of this?  You rest now.  I'll give you more later.  No, but he's covered with old wounds, all sorts of scars.  Knife scars, bullet scars, burns.  There are words on his shoulder. Tannhauser Gate, the Argentine Sector, Montana, Bolivia, Shanghai 2012...  We'll have to sleep on the floor.        This way...  You have to watch out for them. They probably wouldn't kill someone your size, not if you were healthy anyway.  But they'd make you pretty sick.  Someone smaller...like me, or a child...  In a month this one will be as big as those.  Here.  You try one.  ...And it got worse and worse.  My father hadn't had any work in three months and...also...there were other things...violence...  political feelings.  My father said he'd heard it was better in the Trinity moons. A lot of other people must have had the same idea because the ship was jammed with people...mostly families.  That's probably why it broke down...  overloaded.  Even after they made the repairs, it barely got off the ground, it was an old converted mining transport, a piece of junk to start with.  It just...dropped.  Maybe you saw what's left of it...out there in the wind.  A lot of people died.  And we couldn't make any radio contact... So we were stuck here.  Nobody was happy about it.  A few years later, when the dumpers started coming over and dropping stuff, people tried to get their attention with explosions and fires.  But it didn't work. They must be unmanned...or they just don't care.  Maybe they think we're garbage too!  So there really wasn't any choice. People had to pull together and make the best of it.  We became a... community.  One good thing...nobody bothers us. Who'd want to fight over a godforsaken place like this?  I guess that's what you like!  The fighting, I mean.  The wars. You must...you're a soldier...  CHESTER, SALLY, ELLEN, HAWKINS, even SLADE, SINGING. ANGLE ON THE DOOR.  No sign of TODD!  Gone!  We'll eat these.  It seemed like he was never going to walk.  Then all of a sudden...he's an expert.    Sergeant Todd...what's it like...what's it like being a soldier?  What do you think about?  Do you think about food?  Or women? You must think about something.  What about feelings then?  You must have feelings.  You must feel something.       You don't...look afraid.  You look fearless.    It's beautiful, Jimmy.  He'll love it.    He's not fully recovered.  I know.  Are you afraid of him, Mace?  He told me he's afraid.  What happened?    Mace!  What about the vote? Everybody voted.  What's going on?  Keep going, children, don't panic, don't panic.  Into the bedroom, all of you.  Sergeant Todd!  Nathan, thank God, there you...  Did he find you?  My husband...Mace...he went out to look for you.  He...found you, didn't he?  They...killed him...didn't they?  Your wound...it's still bleeding.  It doesn't...hurt?  How do you know they'll come back?  What...what do they want?  Nothing?  You know who they are, don't you? Do you know how many there'll be?  Seventeen!  My God! You can't fight seventeen yourself! You have to organize the rest of us, show us what to do.  We don't have your...your skills...but we're not cowards.  We'll do what you tell us, we'll --  Why not?  But...one soldier against seventeen!  Sergeant!  Sergeant Todd!  Sergeant...these soldiers...the ones you're going to fight...  Are these the \"better ones\"...the ones who replaced you?

Sarah, you hang on to Sergeant Todd. No matter what happens!  Ellen, go to the Commons.  Tell Jimmy Pig and Mr. Slade that Sergeant Todd says we have to leave as soon as they get everybody out of the root-cellar.  Can you do that?  It's all right.  The soldiers are gone for now.

One of the most successful and older of these soldiers (Russell) is pitted against a new breed of soldiers, and after the confrontation is believed to be dead. His body is left behind in a semi-abandoned colonial planet, where everything is peaceful, and he is taught about the other aspects of life.
