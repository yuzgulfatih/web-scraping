        "Gabriel": "Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.   News of Boston, father?   Father...?   The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...   Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.   Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.  Marion shakes his head and sits down, carefully extracting a delicate pair of reading glasses from a wooden box.  He begins reading.   Scott Higgins joined the militia.  Marion hears but doesn't respond.  Thomas looks up from his lead soldiers.   He's seventeen.  A year younger than  The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.   Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.   He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.   Lee is counting on your vote and expects you to be the first to enlist.  Marion nods thoughtfully without revealing what he thinks of Lee's expectations.  Marion turns back to watch the mob.   Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.   When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.  Marion looks closely at Gabriel.   Yes.  They lock eyes for a moment, then Gabriel turns from his father and walks away, joining the crush around the recruiting table.  Marion stands alone in the middle of the chaos.  The FIFES AND DRUMS continue to play.  Marion doesn't hear them.  Harry Lee walks out of the Assembly hall with a triumphant group of Patriots who look at Marion coldly.  Lee excuses himself, and steps over next to Marion.  Lee sees that Marion is watching Gabriel at the enlistment table.   Have you seen any Redcoats?   It wasn't like Saratoga.  There, we stayed in the trees, but this time Gates marched us straight at the Redcoats.  They fired two volleys into us and we broke like straw.  I was given these dispatches... I saw Virginia Regulars surrender... as they laid down their weapons the British Green Dragoons rode into them and hacked them to bits... killed them all, over two hundred men.  Marion's appalled.   I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.   I have no choice, I...  Gabriel passes out.  Marion catches him and carries him to a day-bed in the parlor.  As Marion lays him down, they hear HEAVY MUSKET FIRE, VERY CLOSE.  Marion hurries to the door and looks out into the night, the children cluster around him, seeing a strange sight.   I carried those.  I was wounded, these people gave me care, they have nothing to do with the dispatches.   I did.   Father...   The Morgans, the Halseys, Williams, Stantons...  The smoke from the separate fires joins together high in the sky, forming what looks like stormclouds.  They walk on.   Father, it's safe.  Marion hustles the children out of the woods.   How are they?  Marion just shakes his head.   Gates is at Hillsboro with the Continental Army.  I'll leave in the morning to join him.  Marion nods.  Marion and Gabriel stand in silence for a long moment, neither one finding words.  Then Gabriel speaks softly.   I'll tend my horse.  He leaves Marion alone.   Father, we have to do something...  The British cavalry slams into the blue line, shattering it.  Tiny bits of blue move in every direction.   Father...   Colonel Lee, I request a transfer to Colonel Marion's command.   What now, sir?   We'd cover more ground if we split up.   Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.   I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.   Yes, sir.  My father taught me.  Marion looks at Gabriel closely.   He tried.  It didn't take.  Marion looks Gabriel up and down.   Yes, sir.  They mount up.   Yes...  ... father.  They ride off in different directions.   Father, this war is about more than Thomas.  Marion doesn't look up.   If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.   You know how old I am.   Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.   I didn't see any.  Marion nods and motions to his men who check their weapons and pass the word.  Gabriel ties up his horse and takes a position near his father.   And the dogs, too, I'll wager.   He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.   He's my father.  Billings looks closely at Gabriel.   I know him well enough?   Father?   I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...   Uh... uh... I...   If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.   It's a start.  She gives him a bit of a smile.  He checks out her teeth.   They look nice.  As white as can be.  She tries to glare but she can't help but laugh.  MARION AND BILLINGS watch as Anne gives Gabriel some apples which he tosses into the air, one-by-one, catching them behind his back, a cocky move, executed with a disarming smile that makes Anne laugh again.  Marion smiles at his son's flirtation.  Billings smiles as well.   We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.   Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.   Father, no...  As Marion spurs his horse to ride after Tarleton, Gabriel grabs the bridle.  He YANKS HARD, stopping Marion's horse dead.  THE HORSE BUCKS, nearly throwing Marion...   Father, please...  Marion looks down at Gabriel.  Then Marion looks over at Billings and the three wounded men...  One bleeds from an ugly neck wound... their shared mounts are nearly spent...  Marion takes a last look in the direction of the departing Tarleton.  Then he dismounts and hurries over to help the wounded.  Gabriel watches his father for a moment, then joins him with the wounded.   Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.   When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?   Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.  Marion is silent.   There will be a time and a place for revenge but killing Tarleton at the expense of your duty serves no one but yourself.  Stay the course.  The parental-sounding formality of Gabriel's words brings a thin smile to Marion's face.   She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.   She got me at a more impressionable age.  Marion smiles, nods a silent thanks to his son and heads over to help with the wounded.   That would be nice.   That would be nice, too.  She takes a pot off the campfire and pours him a cup of tea.   But they're prisoners-of-war!  Marion isn't as surprised as Gabriel.  He is, however, taken aback by Gabriel's black teeth.  Gabriel notices everyone looking at his mouth.  Anne is embarrassed and regretful, seeing her joke fly in the face of the troubling news.   It's all set.  They follow Aaron, down an alley to A SHACK.  Small. Barely standing.  The children stop in their tracks, knowing this is to be their new home.  Charlotte sees their hesitation.  She walks up to the little structure, examining it with a critical eye.  She looks on the doorway, seeing a single room, a dirt floor, wax-paper instead of glass in the windows, a rude, chimney-less fire-pit against the back wall.  She smiles.   Yes.   They won't stop looking for you and the children.   I don't know... I'm his son.  Gabriel steps over to his saddlebags, opens his pack and pulls out a stack of letters which he hands to Charlotte.   These are for you and the children.  They sense someone behind them.   He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.   I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.  Susan says nothing.  Gabriel continues, hopefully.   There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.   You don't hate him.   Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.   She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.   Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.   Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.  Marion nods and curiously follows Gabriel.   Father, I'm looking for a best man.  Marion is stunned but recovers quickly.   Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?   Cheraw Falls.   I know.  They're silent for a moment.   Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.   Seven homes along the Black River so far...  Rollins doesn't pause.  He rushes to his horse, mounts up and rides off.  Marion and the other men mount up and ride off fast after him.   Anne...?  As Gabriel gets to the entrance of the livery stable, Marion walks out and intercepts him.   Is it her?  Is Anne in there?   Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?   No, I don't.   Tell me what everyone doesn't know.   That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.   That's not enough.  Tell me.   I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.  Marion's quiet for a moment.  Then he speaks:   Go on.   I see, do as I say, not as I do.   As you did at Fort Wilderness?  Before Marion can answer they see HARRY LEE RIDE UP TO THEM.  He dismounts, excited, voluble.  He strides over, pleased to see Marion, oblivious to his and Gabriel's mood.    Marion THROWS THE TOMAHAWK, sinking it into Wilkins' chest...  The rest of Marion's men thunder into the Dragoons...  Overpowering them...  Marion races to Gabriel...  Throws himself onto the ground next to him...  Cradling him...  Gabriel is stunned, confused by the wounds.   I'm alright, I...  He tries to stand...    The life drains from Marion.  No anger.  Only pain.  He looks at Gabriel, lost in a dream, an incomprehensible nightmare of loss and overwhelming emptiness.",

        "Anne": "I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.   It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.   You call that a compliment?   Next time we'll bring more blankets.   Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.   Just because the French didn't come this fall, doesn't mean they're never going to come.  He nods and takes a drink of the tea.  She smiles. Gabriel smiles back to her, revealing a mouthful of ink- stained, black teeth.  Before she has time to laugh...  ROLLINS RIDES HARD INTO CAMP.  Marion hurries over, accompanied by the Great Danes.  The other men gather around.   I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.   May I ask you a question?  Marion finishes with the knife and puts it away without explanation.   Do you think Frances with an \"e\" is too manly a name for a girl?   Do you think Francis with an \"i\" is too womanly a name for a boy?   Good.  Anne smiles and walks away.  Marion figures out what she just told him.   Late summer.   Thank you.  Marion laughs at the thought.   Everyone?",

        "Billings": "You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?   Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?   Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose...  What about you?  You've got a lot to lose.  Marion drains his glass and stands up.   We have enough arms for an army. Now all we need is an army.  Marion checks out a wagon full of tools with DAN SCOTT and ROB FIELDING, a couple of sharp-eyed craftsmen.  They overlap dialogue, rapidly speaking the private language of colonial artisans.   Shoot them!  Shoot the damn things!  Dalton prepares to do so.   No wonder they were guarding it.  Gabriel opens a trunk and finds it filled with powdered wigs, all perfectly coifed and stored on head-shaped wig- stands.  Rev. Oliver opens one of several identical cases and finds it filled with papers.   I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.   Am I one of that sort?   He's not making light.  Gabriel shoots Billings a dubious look.   You don't know him very well, do you?   Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.  Gabriel looks at Billings, then turns back to the fire.   Well?   Cheerful news to greet the morn.   Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.   We got our own little party...   Twenty men here, seventeen in New Brighton, a dozen along the Black River.  We'll pass three hundred by week's end if this keeps up.   He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.   You got me beat on both accounts.   You got salt last week.   We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.  Gabriel sighs.  They hear a SOUND APPROACHING, then see two British wagons round a curve with a guard of only SIX REDCOATS, commanded by a REDCOAT SERGEANT.  The Redcoat Sergeant signals stop.   Damn your eyes.  Do your worst.",
        "Thomas": "Better.  She's near ready to calve.  Marion nods and motions for Susan to go with Gabriel and Thomas to the house.  She does so and Marion walks on alone toward:   Look!  There's Gabriel!  They see Gabriel making his way through the crowd.  He sees them and waves, then enters the house.  A moment later Charlotte steps out onto the balcony and sees:  IN THE SQUARE, a pair of drunk Sons of Liberty, pull down one of the smoldering effigies, cut off its head, then start hacking at it's groin with a sword.  Appalled, Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and snaps at the children.   When?  Marion looks closely at his son, giving him the courtesy of really thinking about the answer.   But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.   Alright.  Seventeen.  Marion offers his hand.  They shake firmly, like adults. Marion takes the coat off Thomas and puts it back in the trunk.  They walk down the stairs together.   That's not thunder.  The SOUND BECOMES DEEPER, MORE OMINOUS.  They all notice the change.   But father, they might come this way.   The battle, were you there?   Father?   Father, do something.  Thomas grows increasingly agitated.  He sees that his father is going to do nothing.  He gauges the distance between Gabriel and the cover of the nearby woods.  Then suddenly, Thomas SPRINGS.  He RUNS, THROWING HIMSELF, into the two Redcoats holding Gabriel, KNOCKING THEM DOWN.   Gabriel!  Run!  Gabriel is too shocked to take flight.  A few of the Redcoats, including one of the ones knocked down, shake their heads with sad laughter at Thomas' ineffectual gesture.  One of them grabs Thomas by the scruff of the neck and yanks him to his feet.  TARLETON sees the commotion.  Without pausing he DRAWS HIS   THOMAS is thrown to his knees by the shot.  Stunned, confused, he looks down and sees the massive exit wound in his chest.  MARION, horrified, catches Thomas as he falls, easing him to the ground.  MARGARET CRIES OUT.  THE OTHER CHILDREN are stunned to silence.  The REDCOATS are frozen in place.  Tarleton's GREEN DRAGOONS are impassive, having seen worse.  MARION holds his son, looking at the huge, incomprehensible wound.  He knows that Thomas is already dead, though his body still moves.  MARION'S stunned agony turns to fury.  He rises, his eyes trained on Tarleton, then stops as...  TARLETON raises a second loaded pistol and a DOZEN GREEN DRAGOONS raise pistols and carbines, aiming them at Marion and his children.  MARION FREEZES, torn between his fury and fear for his other children.  He locks his eyes on Tarleton.  TARLETON calmly baths in Marion's anger.  Then, with a hard yank of the reins, he jerks his horse's head around and utters a sharp command to Wilkins.",

Throws himself onto the ground next to him...  Cradling him...  Gabriel is stunned, confused by the wounds.   Sir?  Cornwallis fumes.  His jaw sets with anger.  He slowly crumples the dispatch and speaks with quiet fury.",
        "Peter": "",
        "Charlotte": "Grand.  Four stories.  Marion and his children pull up. CHARLOTTE MOTTE hurries out.  She's in her mid-thirties, beautiful, with a deep sadness that she keeps hidden as best she can.  The children leap from the carriages and swarm around her, embracing her, smothering her with kisses.   Welcome!  Welcome!  Margaret, William, look at you...!  They're huge.  What have you been feeding them?   Thank you.  Charlotte hustles the children toward the door.   Come, come, inside, wait until you see what I have...   Inside, inside...  Charlotte sweeps past Marion who smiles and follows her into the house.    Marion watches as Charlotte finishes handing out presents. Susan plays with a new doll.  William has half-a-dozen new spinning tops, skimming around the floor.  Margaret holds a new dress up to herself.  Samuel, Nathan and Thomas tear into packages holding platoons of lead soldiers.  Gabriel looks through a new book.  Charlotte sees Marion watching her, rises and joins him at the doorway.   As do you.  Suddenly Thomas and Samuel race through the doorway, forcing Marion and Charlotte together, their bodies close. They step back and exchange warm but uneasy smiles.  The moment is broken by the SOUND OF CHILDREN.  Marion and Charlotte gratefully turn their attention back to them.    Marion's children, except Gabriel, stand on the balcony watching the mob.  Marion steps out onto the balcony.   Children, inside!  All of you! Right now.  The children start to protest, but a glance at Charlotte's resolute expression makes them think better of it.  They file into the house.  Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and shoos the children inside.  Gabriel steps out and joins them.   And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.    Marion and his children wait in the cover of the woods. They see a pair of shadowed figures coming toward them from the house, Gabriel and Charlotte.   I'll stay with them.  Marion nods and leaves Charlotte with the children.    Marion enters.  He starts to pace but grows unsteady.  He rears back as if screaming but no sound comes from his mouth, as he looks upstairs, knowing his children are searching for the solace of sleep.  He opens a cabinet, pulls out a bottle of liquor, pours and drinks.  Then another.  THE SOUND OF HORSEMEN.  Gabriel walks in.  Tired.  Grim.    Marion stares at the fireplace.  Charlotte walks in carrying a pitcher and fresh clothing.   They're asleep.  Marion is silent.  Charlotte pours water into a washbowl and motions to Marion.  He takes off his shirt.  She begins cleaning away the blood and tending the wound on his neck.   You couldn't have known.   Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.   If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.    Marion and Gabriel finish saddling their horses.  Marion embraces Nathan and Samuel.  Then he turns to Margaret, William and Susan.    A thick ground fog surrounds Charlotte's house.  The soft lights of candles glow in the windows.  All appears peaceful.  Then, the SHADOWED FIGURES of THREE DOZEN GREEN DRAGOONS appear out of the mist, silently approaching the house on foot.    A fire crackles in the fireplace.  A curtain blows in the open window.  THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN.  WINDOWS BREAK.  Green Dragoons pour into the house, muskets brandished.  No sign of occupants.  CAPTAIN MORROW barks a command:    A TORCH BURNS.  A dozen Dragoons light torches off of it and fan out to search.  The thick fog turns the torches into diffused, floating balls of light, turning the Dragoons into ghost-like apparitions.  CAMERA FOLLOWS ONE OF THE TORCHES, carried by a particularly rough-looking Dragoon who skirts the edge of the underbrush closest to the house.  As the torch moves, its flame sends long shadows and shafts of light into the underbrush...  The CAMERA STOPS to reveal, in the brush, TWO FACES, GABRIEL AND CHARLOTTE, dark, motionless, watching the search.  Behind them, MARION'S OTHER CHILDREN, Nathan, Samuel, Margaret, William and Susan...  Around them, SEVERAL MORE OF MARION'S MEN, including ABNER BROWN, weapons ready.  The moving lights play on their faces.  AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE, the torches converge, illuminating Tarleton who gives the unheard order.  The torches fan out and begin SETTING FIRE TO THE HOUSE, BARNS  This will do fine.  She turns to Aaron and Abigail.   Thank you.  Charlotte walks inside without looking back.  The children hesitate, then follow her inside.   So he's the one they talk about, the Swamp Fox.   I thought it might be him, the bits and pieces we heard, a veteran, fought in the French and Indian War, knows the swamps.   We'll be alright, here, for now.  How is he?  Gabriel searches for an honest answer.   Speaking for months now.   I'm not my sister.  Startled, Marion turns to Charlotte.   I said, I'm not my sister.   Do you?    Very well, then.  She turns from him.  Marion, tries to figure out what just happened.  After a long moment he gets it.  Stunned at first, his gears turn.  After a very thoughtful moment he turns to Charlotte and offers a tentative smile.  She rolls her eyes.   Goodbye.  They embrace.  Though the hug is chaste, their eyes tell a different story.  Only Anne and Margaret notice, but to them it's as clear as a bell.  They exchange a knowing look.  Marion and Charlotte break apart, self-consciously.  Marion and Gabriel mount up and start to ride away.  As they're about to round a curve and disappear, SUSAN CRIES  Lovely.  He smiles and make a minute adjustment in the chair's position.  Then he sits down, settles back and begins rocking.  Not a creak.  Marion and Charlotte watch Susan run out of the yard, calling as she joins the other children.",

        "Oliver": "I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.  Marion accepts his condolences.  He notes GEORGE DALTON, a tough-looking, rustic man with an ice-cold, distant stare.   ... two-hundred-sixty-six Brown Bess muskets, forty-one casks of powder, balls, tamping...   My heavens, personal correspondence of... Lord Cornwallis.  Marion grabs some papers, scans them, then finds matching cases on nearby wagons.   Thank you.   For trying to impose some decency on that sort.   Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony...  MARION feels every word, looking straight ahead but knowing that he's standing next to his son.   For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.  Marion nods.  They ride on.   It's not time for vengeance, it's time to mourn and...   About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.  Marion nods.  He and Gabriel join some of the men under one of the lean-to's.   May I help you try to find solace with the word of God?  No response.   Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...   Yes, he does.  Rev. Oliver pulls up a camp stool.  He and Marion sit in silence.",
        "Dan": "CHARLOTTE sits on the front porch, NURSING AN INFANT.  MARION walks out of his workshop, trailed by Susan.  He carries a just-completed rocking chair.  The chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue.  He steps onto the porch next to Charlotte and places the rocking chair next to her.",
        "Scott": "Reamer, boring tool...   We can rifle those musket barrels...   Easy enough...   Oil cloth and barrel staves to make a bellows...    That's why he's a colonel.  Scott and Fielding roll up their sleeves and get to work. Marion hears a COMMOTION OF BARKING DOGS AND YELLING MEN and strides over to find Billings cowering before TWO HUGE GREAT DANES who stand guard at one of the wagons.   They followed us from the bridge. They won't let anyone near the wagon.  Marion steps forward, speaking softly but firmly to the dogs."
