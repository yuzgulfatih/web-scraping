        "Klaatu": "We have come to visit you in peace -- and with good will.     Gort! Deglet ovrosco!     It was a gift. For your President. With this he could have studied life on other planets.      About five months -- your months.  About 250 million of your miles.  (easily; he's a diplomat, too  I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.  I mean the reasons for my coming here.  I'd be glad to. Not now, of course -- with you alone.    I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.    We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.        I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously. How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?  Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?  I don't want to resort to threats, Mr. Harley. I simply tell you bluntly that the future of your planet is at stake... I suggest you transmit that message to the nations of the Earth.       Thank you... Have you any news?  It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.     I can judge only by what I see.       Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.           My name is Carpenter. I'm looking for a room.  No -- I'm afraid not.  How did you know?          (quietly, tongue in cheek  I must admit I'm a little confused.  I haven't any plans.  I'd be glad to spend the day with him -- if you'd let me.  Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday afternoon. We talked -- and listened to the radio. I thought today he might show me around the city.          (with an air of discovery  That's the kind of man I'd like to talk to.  Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?    Yes -- that would do nicely.  (he pauses thoughtfully, speaks slowly, as he recalls the newspaper story he read  Where is that?        (with a quizzical smile    (quietly, after a glance around  No. It's for a lot of other things, too.  Yes -- I think so.     Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.  Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--         (alter a moment's pause    Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.  Wouldn't you like to meet him?          It's a problem in celestial mechanics.  (he shakes his head, smiling     If he's that difficult to see, perhaps we ought to leave a calling card.    We came to see Professor Barnhardt.  You might keep this. I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.  (pointing to the blackboard       No -- I'm afraid not.      What would you like to do this afternoon?  All right.  Certainly. Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?  No -- I want to take you to the movies. Do you think they'd accept these?        Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.  Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?    (puzzled that anyone should know him (then recalling, with a smile of satisfaction  Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.  We certainly did.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.  I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.    In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.  (with a deprecating shrug  No -- I'm afraid not.    (appalled by what he has seen and heard  (pretending impatience, but actually growing concerned  It's very important, Lieutenant, that I see Professor Barnhardt.  May I suggest that you call the Professor?     Sorry to trouble you, Lieutenant.   (glancing at the blackboard reproachfully  All you have to do now is substitute this expression-- --at this point.  Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.   (Barnhardt stares at him blankly  My name is Klaatu. I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday. If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.    (ignoring the invitation     In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people-- We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.  (with cool impressive emphasis (indicating the telephone   We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago. After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.  I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.   (with a suggestion of deference to Barnhardt  (sternly, as this unpleasant episode is recalled   Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand. Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.    I leave that in your hands.  No -- not at all.  My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.  I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.  (with a sense of quiet, inescapable power (he looks for the right word  I assure you such power exists.  Yes.  Yes -- of course.          Everyone seems so--  (with a contemplative smile    Warm and friendly and intelligent-- You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.    Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.  Have a good time -- both of you.      (with a warm smile of complete understanding and appreciation  Bobby -- have you a flashlight?   (cutting off further questions                    May I see you for a minute?    (watching Helen's reaction  I want to know what he told you last night.  (refusing to be put off (Helen hesitates, trapped by uncertainty     Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--  (a moment's hesitation; then he remembers  We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.  It won't work.  (after a moment, quietly       I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.    Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--  Who?  I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.  At the ship.           I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.            (with a grateful glance at Gort, he turns to Helen    No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.  (indicating the equipment Gort used  How long will I live? That no one can say.     Gort and I will be leaving soon.  He'll have you -- and Tom.  I'm sorry.  Gort -- berengo.     (straightforwardly, with almost stern authority (he pauses, studying the faces        We of the other planets have long accepted this principle. We have an organization for the mutual protection of all planets -- and for the complete elimination of aggression. A sort of United Nations on the Planetary level... The test of any such higher authority, of course, is the police force that supports it. For our policemen, we created a race of robots-- Their function is to patrol the planets -- in space ships like this one -- and preserve the peace. In matters of aggression we have given them absolute power over us.      The result is that we live in peace, without arms or armies, secure in the knowledge that we are free from aggression and war -- free to pursue more profitable enterprises. We do not pretend to have achieved perfection -- but we do have a system -- and it works. I came here to give you the facts. It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet -- but if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned- out cinder.     Your choice is simple. Join us and live in peace. Or pursue your present course -- and face obliteration. We will be waiting for your answer. decision rests with you.  Gort -- veracto.",
        "Helen": "(with an apologetic smile at Klaatu  (good-naturedly, calming him down    Maybe he's afraid.  After all, he was shot the moment he landed here. I was just wondering what I would do.  Oh -- thank you.       There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.  (hesitating, a little confused, by the offer (remembering the two men haven't met           'Night.  Hello, darling. Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.    (moved and grateful, she's uneasy and concerned as she turns to Klaatu  Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.  I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.  (flashing him a puzzled, incredulous look  Of course, dear.  Yes, I'm waiting for Tom to pick me up.  Jittery is the word.  He has his homework to keep him occupied.  Naturally I think so.  (hesitantly and with some difficulty  Hello--  I will be in just a minute.      Why don't you wait in here while I get my things?    I'll go get my things.  Mr. Carpenter, I-- Goodnight.  Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.  (hesitantly, almost guiltily  Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?  What do you mean, dear?  No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it. 'Night, darling.    Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?  Tell me what?    Bobby, you've been dreaming again.  (holding him close to her sympathetically (with a look and a nod to Tom   Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.    (takes the stone and studies it, amazed by its size  He gave these to you?    (cutting him off with a look     Yes, dear. Come on now. Bobby, your shoes are soaking!    I -- I was Just going to lunch.   (recognizing the voice, she glances nervously at Klaatu  (with a nervous glance at Klaatu  (glancing at him apprehensively   (with a nervous little laugh     There's another elevator we can use--  (her nerves raw and edgy    Just twelve.  (preoccupied with her own thinking   Why not?  Bobby was telling the truth -- wasn't he?     Yes, of course. Of course I do.  (studying his face anxiously  (looks at her watch, then back at him, awe-struck  Where are you going now?  No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.  Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.   (interrupting herself in sudden decision    Tell him I want to see him the minute he gets in... No, I'll call back.  Yes, I am, Margaret.  Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--  (trying to appear calm  (evenly, with quiet tension  Never mind about that. You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.  You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.  That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.      I'm not going to let you do it, Tom. Believe me, this is literally the most important thing in the world.  Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!    I'm not going to marry anybody.     Where is the meeting going to be?           (trying to give him encouragement  Gort? But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?  (shocked and bewildered, she repeats nervously                             Gort--! Klaatu -- barada -- nikto.

(understandably unenthusiastically       You still haven't answered my question.  The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--  A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.  You ready?  (a little annoyed that she hasn't her coat on, he consults his watch  (lightly, but with real sarcasm underneath     Where did you see all this, Bobby?    He's not there. But look what I found in his room  (with the shrug of an amateur  This doesn't make sense... I think the guy's a crook. I never did trust him.

Helen, he's the man from the space ship! I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?  How do you know?  Are you crazy? After what happened today?

As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.  (to the Captain, his voice a little unsteady  It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity. Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.  That was my first question.  Yes -- that is true.    (thoughtful and impressed     Would you care to be more specific?  I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.    Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.  It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.  You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?  What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?  (smiling, but a little concerned  (he suddenly pauses, thoughtfully  Such power exists?  The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake. You mentioned a demonstration of force--  Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?  Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.  (frightened by his easy assumption of infinite power  (with a nervous half- smile     Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.

But I had permission from the Army--  Ladies and Gentlemen--     I called you from your work and from your homes all over the world because we were to meet here tonight with a man from another planet -- the man who came here in this ship. As you all know, this is no longer possible. I can only say that I share the bitterness of your disappointment.     --under the circumstances, the Army people have asked us to leave the building.
