        "Mercer": "Evening, Governor.  Shame, huh? He was carryin' this. It's a letter to the King. It's from *you*.  Where is she?  Most recently seen on the island of Tortuga, then left, in the company of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow. *And* other fugitives from justice.  The last of our ships has returned.   None. But... one of the ships did pick up a man adrift at sea. He had these.",
        "Elizabeth": "Will...!  Why is this happening?  I think it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.   On what charges?  *What are the charges?*  We are under the jurisdiction of the King's governor of Port Royal, and you will tell us what we are charged with.   *Captain* Jack Sparrow.  Jack's Compass. What does Beckett want with that?  I have faith in you. Both of you. Where will you find him?  Properly?  If it weren't for these bars I'd have you already.  I'll wait for you.  Why don't you tell me what's happening?  No! Will has gone to find Jack!  He's a better man than you give him credit for.  A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.   Then what is?  I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding. I'm here to negotiate.   These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King?  Or else I would not still be here. You sent Will to get you the Compass owned by Jack Sparrow. It will do you no good.   I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself. There is something you need to know.  Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.   These aren't going to Jack.  What's that over there?  I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself!  James Norrington.  What has the world done to you?  Captain Sparrow!  I'm here to find the man I love.  Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.   Jack. I know Will came to find you. Where is he?  Davy Jones?  Jack. All I want is to find Will.  'Course.  And you have a way of doing that?  How do we find it?  Where does it point?  Oh Jack! Are you telling the truth?   To save Will?  Yes, they're signed, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company.   Yes, he did say something about a chest.   Persuasion.  Decidedly not.  Jack, the Letters, give them back.   You do know Will taught me how handle a sword.  I don't know what you mean.  Oh, don't be absurd. I trust him, that's all.  I just thought I'd be married by now. I'm so ready to be married.  No, thank you.  Oh. Except for a sense of honor, and decency and-and a moral center. And personal hygiene.  You seem very certain.  Why doesn't your Compass work?  Because you and I *are* alike, and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it. To do the right thing.   You'll have the chance to do something... something courageous. And when you do, you'll discover something: that you're a good man.  I have faith in you. Want to know why?   Curiosity. You're going to want it. A chance to be admired. And gain the rewards that follow. You won't be able to resist. You're going to want to know... what it tastes like.  But - seeing as you're a good man I know you will *never* put me in a position that would compromise my honor.  I'm proud of you, Jack.  This doesn't work. And it *certainly* doesn't show you what you want most.   Beg your pardon?  It's real!  Will! You're alright! Thank God! I came to find you!  What?  Everything you said to me... every  Stop it!  Jack!  *No*!  This is bar-*baric*! This is *no* way for grown men to settle - ! Oh! Fine! Let's just - *pull* out our swords and start *banging* away at each other! *This will solve everything!* I've had it! I've had enough! Wobbly-legged, rum-soaked... *pirates*!  Will! *Enough!*  Oh! Oh...! The heat!  Sword!  We're not getting out of this.  You're mad.  Norrington took it to draw them off.   *Hard to starboard!*  She's falling behind!  What is it?  Will?  Will?  *Will?*  There's no boats.  As soon as you're clear.  Step to!  Oh you coward!  He's right, we have to head for land.   Thank you, Jack.  You came back. I always knew you were a good man.  It's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see? I'm not sorry.  He elected to stay behind to give us a chance.  Go!  He was a good man.  Yes.",

Anyways, I ain't stealin' no ship.  Since we're not immortal no more. We gotta take care of our immortal souls.   It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.   What's got into *'im*?  Stupid mongrel!  Tide's comin', that should help. Well, salvagin' is saving, in a manner of speaking.  Suppose we be'er... save it as soon as we can. What with our souls in such a vulnerable state, and all.  ?Thief/?Thing! Little hairy ?thief/?thing! Give it back!  Don't bite it!  He's got me eye! He won't give it back!   Nothing... bad, I hope.  Dichotomy of good and evil.  Literally, or figuratively?  Your chariot awaits you, sire! Ha, ha-ha-ha, ha-ha!  Bon voyage! Ha-ha-ha!  Unh-unh... unh-unh... unh-unh...  You're pulling too slow. We don't want the Kraken to catch us.  What, with a long A?  No-no-no-no-no-no-no. Krock-en's how it's pronounced in the original Scandinavian, and Krack-en's closer to that.  It's a mythological creature, I can calls it what I wants.  I ?can/?may join the circus!  Well, each wants the chest for hisself, don't 'e? Mister Norrington, I think he's tryna regain a bit of honor. Old Jack's lookin' to trade it, save his own skin. And Turner there - I figure 'e's tryna... settle some unresolved business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father.  Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Terrible temptation.   Sword!  You're not pulling hard enough!  That's a lot o' wa'er.  Never another like Captain Jack.  Aye.",

I don't believe that's the answer to the question I asked.  For which the punishment, regrettably, is *also* death. Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.   Captain Jack Sparrow.

By your efforts Jack Sparrow was set free. I would like you to go to him, and recover a certain property in his possession.  *Bargain*!  Letters of Marque. You will offer what amounts to a full pardon. Jack will be free, a privateer in the employ of England.  Freedom.  Jack Sparrow is a dying breed. The world is shrinking, the blank pages  The Black Pearl?  A ship? Hardly. The item in question's considerably smaller and far more valuable. Something Sparrow keeps on his person at all times.

Shall I remove these shackles?  So you see, Mercer, every man has a price he will willingly accept. Even for what he hopes never to sell.  Is there any news on the chest?

So you never wondered how your *latest*  You actually *were* telling the truth.   I can't let you do that, either. So sorry.  Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest.

Oh! *That's* why.  As you were, gents.  Ah!  Bootstrap. Bill Turner.  Is this a dream?  I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.  I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way.  Your son.  And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?  Who?  Ah. So it's you, then.  He shanghaied you into service, eh?  It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment -  Technic -  Yes, but the Flying Dutchman already *has* a captain, so there's re -  Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?

This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost -  ...Captain Jack... Sparrow.  Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.  I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs, now where is that monkey? I want to shoot *something*.  Ah.  Have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on 'er? Maybe just lock her up somewhere.   There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes.   Mister Gibbs!  We have a need to travel upriver.  No, a... resolute and unyielding need.   William... I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me... to find *this*.   No. *You* want you to find this. Because the finding this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating and your discovering the detecting of a way to save your ?dolly/?dotty belle ol'... what's-her-face. Savvy?  How much do you know about Davy Jones?   Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.  No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go way back. Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable we are. Were. Have been. Before.   It's me front I'm worried about. Mind the boat.  Tia Dalma!  There'll be no knowing here. We've come for help and we're not leaving without it.  I thought *I* knew you.  Come.  I brought payment.  Look!  An undead monkey! Top that!  We're looking for this.  And what it goes to.  Maybe. Why?  A *woman*.  I did not. I didn't know where the key was. But now we do. So all that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, hey!  My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.  Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.  Is the... jar of dirt going to help?   No.  Neither do you. Do *not* underestimate her.  So what's your plan, then?  And if there are crewmen?  I like it. Simple, easy to remember.   Hey! If you *do* happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt! Might save your life!  Douse the lamps.  Oh.  Technically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.  You have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.   Aha! So we've established my proposal is sound in principle, now we're just haggling over price.  Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth?  You're a diamond, mate. Send me back the boy, I'll get started right off.   Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic, *terrific* soprano. Worth at least four... maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed.  Dividing him from her and her from him... would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony. Aye?  Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal  Uh!  Oh, Mr. Gibbs.  Uh, I feel sullied and unusual.  Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be.  Tortuga.  I know what I want.  How we going?  You're hired.  Time to go?  Thanks, mate.  Carry on.  Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard.   I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.  Elizabeth.  Hide the rum.  You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.  Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but... through an unfortunate and *entirely* unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew.   You look bloody awful. What are you  You *smell* funny.  Are you certain? Is that what you really want most?  Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most.   Well, there is a chest...  A chest of unknown size and origin.   And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including... saving brave William from his grim fate.   With this. My Compass... is unique.   True enough. This Compass does not point north.  It points to the thing you want most in this world.  Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?  By finding the chest of Davy Jones.   Mister Gibbs!  We have our heading.  Miss Swann.  Agh.  Agh.  Of course. He wants the chest.  A truly discomforting notion, love.   Might I inquire how as to how you came by these?  Friendly?  Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price.  No. Persuade me.  As I said... Persuade me.  My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.  You know...  Lizzy... I *am*... captain of a ship. And *being* captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a... marriage. Right here. Right on this deck. Right... *now*!  Why not? We *are* very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us.  Trifles. You *will* come over to my side, I know it.  One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist.  Uh my Compass works fine.  I *love* those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.  All evidence to the contrary.  Do tell, dearie.  I *do* want to know what it tastes like.   I want my jar of dirt.  Guard the boat, mind the tide... Don't touch my dirt.  Yes it *does*. You're sitting on it!  Move.  I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.  How did you get here?  Not so easy, is it?  You do?  What?  Oh! Well... you're welcome, then.  Pretty much. Time and tide, love.   Oy! What're you doing?  Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. If you please: The key.  I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.  Ah. The dark side of ambition.  Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?  Still rooting for you, mate!  Wup!  Oh.  Woah!  Oh, shut it.  Jar of dirt!  Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using  Uh, I say we respect his final wish.   He fell behind.  I'll handle this, mate.  Hey! Fishface! Lose something? Hey?  Got it!  Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git? Look what I got.  I got a jar of dirt! I got a jar of dirt! And guess what's inside it?  Hard to starboard.  Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs... is the proper leverage.   Where is it? Where is the thump-thump?   Abandon ship. Into the longboat.  She's only a ship, mate.  We're not free yet, love.  Pirate.  Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger...!  Come on... Come on...  Not so bad.  Oh!  Hello, beastie.",
        "Sparrow": "Sorry, mate.  Mind if we make a little side trip?  Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.   Mm-hmm!  Shiny?  Is that how you're all feeling, then? Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain?  What did the bird say?  Ohhh!  It does me.  No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key.  Gentlemen, what do keys do?  No!

I take this with a promise. I'll find a way to sever Jones' hold on you. And not rest until this blade pierces his heart. I will not abandon you. I promise.   Just put as many leagues behind us as you can. As fast as you can.  That dress. Where did you get it?  That's foolish.  I imagine... some of your crew may have jumped ship there.  Or worse.

I need that Compass of yours, Jack. I must trade it for her freedom.  What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.  You want me to find this?  This... is going to save Elizabeth?  Not much.  Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?   And the key will spare him that?  Her?  Mind the boat.  You know me?  What vexes all men?  What... exactly did he put into the chest?  You knew this.  It seems... we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.  That's the Flying Dutchman? She doesn't look like much.  I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.  I cut down anyone in my path.  Sailor!  Sailor!  There's no use. You've run aground.   Hey! Hey!  Get back! Back!  Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his  Jack Sparrow. He sent me to settle his debt.  Step aside!  I don't need your help!  So I'm to understand what *you* did was an act of compassion?  I've sworn no oath.  Not until I find this. The key.  What do you know of this?  So the captain has the key.  Where *is* the key?  Where is the chest?  I understand. Liar!  It's a game of deception. Your bet includes all the dice, not just your own.  What are they wagering?  So any crewman can be challenged?  I challenge Davy Jones.  My soul. An eternity of servitude.   I want this.  That's not part of the game, is it? You can still walk away.  No! Don't do this.  Four fives.  Eight fives.  Fool. Why did you do that?  It was never about winning, or losing.   It's not a fate you had to choose for yourself, either.  They'll know you helped me.  I take this with a promise. I'll find a way to sever Jones' hold on you. And not rest until this blade pierces his heart. I will not abandon you. I promise.   Just put as many leagues behind us as you can. As fast as you can.  That dress. Where did you get it?  That's foolish.  I imagine... some of your crew may have jumped ship there.  Or worse.  I've doomed us all.  It's the Flying  With good reason!  Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them, strapped to my feet.  But I do owe you thanks, Jack.  After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones.  I was reunited with my father.  I'm gonna kill Jones.  I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.  Guard the chest!  By *your* leave, Mister Norrington.   Be my guest.  Right!  What happened to the chest?  Brace up the foreyard!  We're the faster?  We rob her advantage.  My father is *on* that ship. If we  No. It's not a reef! Get away from the rail!  The Kraken. To arms!  ?It'll ?attack the starboard. I've seen it before. ?Break out the cannons and hold for my signal.  Easy, boys!  Steady! Steady.  Hold. Hold...  *Fire...*!  It'll be back. We have to get off the ship.  Pull the grates! Get all the gunpowder onto the net in the cargo hold.  Whatever you do, don't miss.  Then load the rum!  ?Pull ?away!  Euh! Come on!I'm over here! Come on!  Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!  We have to try. We can get away as it takes down the Pearl.  Where's Jack?  Doesn't matter now. The Pearl's gone. Along with its captain.  If there was anything could be done to bring him back...  Elizabeth...   Aye."
