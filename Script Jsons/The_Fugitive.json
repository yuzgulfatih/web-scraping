        "Sykes": "Inside the apartment the PHONE RINGS. No one is home.    Kimble moves across the roof and drops to fire escape behind Sykes' apartment. He looks in the window, steps back to see if anyone is looking, then pulls his fist back into his sleeve and with one swift pop, BREAKS the GLASS.    No sound. Slowly he moves into...    Kimble struggles to recall the man's face. It could be him.          The two cops receive a radio report about Kimble and quickly exit their car. They rush toward Sykes' building.    CLOSE ON TELEPHONE RECEIVER. It BUZZES off the hook.    Fredrick Sykes, the one-armed man, comes down the side walk. He passes a car and hears the door open behind him. Biggs climbs out of the car and falls into step behind him.  Sykes hears the footsteps but moves on up the stoop and starts to enter his apartment, notices the front door already open.  Cops and Marshals in his house. Processing a crime scene.   What the hell's going on here? Who are you people?  He steps...    ... sees Gerard in the kitchen. Gerard stares at Sykes.   You a cop?   Richard Kimble... I don't know a Richard Kim -  Poole produces a photo of Kimble.   Wait a minute... This is the doctor who killed his wife... He claimed the killer had a prosthetic limb. You telling me he's coming after me?   What the hell's that supposed to mean? Because I have this?  He lifts his prosthetic arm and stares at Gerard. Gerard holds his look.   Look, a year ago some people came to see me. They asked me questions about the night of the murder and I'll tell you the same thing I told them. I wasn't even in town then. I was on a business trip.  Gerard continues moving around the apartment.   Security.   No, I work for a pharmaceutical company. I handle security for its top executives.  Gerard holds up one of the fishing photographs with Lentz.   No. Just some doctors on a company junket.  Gerard puts the photos down with the one of Lentz on top. Sykes eyes it.    Look, you mind if I talk to the cops to see if anything's missing?    Gerard crosses the street with Renfro and Biggs.    Sykes watches the cops in the car outside. He moves to the phone and dials number.   I want to report a fire; No, it's not my place, it's a couple doors down.    Sykes, dressed in coat and tie, prepares to leave apartment. Somewhere in the distance we hear: FIRE ENGINE SIRENS.    The cop stares at Sykes' window when suddenly we hear FIRE SIRENS, and a pair of fire trucks turn onto the street and pull up across the street from the unmarked car -blocking the view of Sykes' house. Firemen climb down and move to a nearby building. The street begins to fill up with people.  The cop stares at the commotion directly behind him. He becomes so engrossed in the action like everyone else that he fails to see Sykes, using the distraction, exit his apartment and walk calmly away from the scene.   Back up. Move to the door, Doc.   This is my stop, Doc.  Kimble stares hard at Sykes. He steps toward the side exit.   Go ahead. You don't have it in you .  For a moment Kimble almost fires, but instead he takes the gun in his right hand and whips it across Sykes' face. Then hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun, driving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost unconscious.  Kimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit Cop. He checks for a pulse - there is none. The Cop is dead.  Kimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the Cop's belt. He reaches for Sykes' wrist, drags him to the Cop and cuffs Sykes to the dead Cop.  He pockets the keys and grabs Sykes' hair, pulls his face off the floor.",
        "Helen": "Hello, Jim.   That would be a little abrupt, don't you think?    I'm sorry, I have to get my husband home.  They say their good-byes and pass Nichols' table. Nichols shakes his friend's hand in passing. From across the room we see Lentz watching.   You looked handsome tonight...   Uh, huh... most men in a tuxedo look like waiters...   You looked more like... a band director.  He stops at red light, leans over and kisses her. Light changes and neither notice. Slowly their kiss breaks.   Are we home yet?...   Call me on your way home.  CREDITS END as we -   I'm glad it went well. I'll see you in a minute.  Helen hangs up phone, turns out the light and starts up the stairs.   He's here... still in the house...   He's trying to kill me...  Kimble appears. Helen drops the phone when she sees him.  911 Will you repeat that please?    Richard... He's trying to kill me... my head.    My head. Richard my hold me.  Her eyes slip away from his. He peels away the hand on her head - and sees raw pummeled brain staring back and realizes she won't be all right.  CAMERA SWINGS DOWN TO the dropped phone.  911 ... Hello. You said his name is Richard? Ma'am, can you talk to me? Ma'am?      A crime scene photograph.   He's trving to kill me...  911 Will you repeat that please?   Richard... He's trying to kill me...   Good-bye. I love you.  Again... Then again... then:",
        "Kimble": "So, what's the deal? If the hospital buys ten new -   On the house, huh?  Tonic water with lime.  Everyone agrees.   Never get me to sell my soul for one of those trips...  His tone silences the group. Kimble takes his drink.     ... But if you get any more Bulls tickets, Nat, give me a call.  The group laughs, Kimble extracts himself and CREDITS   Moving through the crowd.    Nearly gets hit in the follow-through of an imaginary golf swing.   You're slicing, Dave. Don't turn your hip.  He keeps moving.   Hey, Jim.  DR. JAMES NICHOLS turns, smiles. Mid-40s, head of the University Hospital. He is a fit contemporary.    Yeah... Three. Livers appeared hepatetic to me.   Sure.   They fix it this time?   Well, I've seen everyone, can we leave?    A table for ten. Kimble and Helen introduce themselves to others at table ant sit across from each other.  Kimble sits between two doctors' wives. One, NOW EAU WIFE, mid-thirties, bedecked in jewels and loud dress, the other   Kimble and Helen driving home. She runs her fingers through his hair as he drives.   Thank you...  He smiles to himself, seems to enjoy the compliment too much for Helen. Her smile becomes playful, mischievous.   But me?    Kimble pulls up in front of his house. Suddenly both his PAGER and CAR PHONE RING at the same time.    Dr. Kimble  When? Okay, tell them I'll be there in ten minutes.  He hangs up.   Tim's got a problem.  Helen kisses him again, opens the door.   Cavalry's here.  Two harried surgeons look up, glad to see him.   What's his pro time?   You talk to the family?    Okay... I'm clamping. Can he tolerate it?   Do we have a choice?   Marie, give me a clamp...  MARIE, the scrub nurse, passes him the instrument and Kimble and the other SURGEON continue to work with the Resident assisting.    Your husband know you're here tonight, Marie?... What about this liver?   Who referred him?   The wave of the future... Marie, you told Frank yet? Frank is so jealous of this late night thing we've got going here... This should hold him. Bleeding's stopped. Let's get a biopsy...  Send it downstairs and make sure you get Kath her slice.   No. I got a date.    Kimble driving through empty Chicago streets toward home. He is on phone, waits for answer.   Hi. I'm five minutes away...    Helen on the phone, downstairs. She is still in her gown with an afghan around her shoulders. She's been reading.    Helen moves down the hall toward the dressing room/closet.  Opens the door to large closet dressing room and turns on the light. Nothing. She starts to leave and decides to close one of the interior closet doors.  She starts to slide the door closed when - wham!  A hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck. Helen claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her string of pearls bursts...  ... and a single pearl bounces out of the bedroom... rolls across the landing to the stairs, stopping three steps from the top.    Snow swirls around the street as Kimble's car pulls into the driveway. On the third floor, we see a bedroom light still on.    A GRANDFATHER CLOCK TICKS softly. Kimble tosses his keys on the entry table, picks up a stack of mail on the table and calls up the stairs.   I'm home. Did you hear who won the Bulls game?  No answer. He steps into the:    Climbing the stairs... suddenly stops.  A small white ball on the stairs. He bends down and picks it up... a pearl.   Helen?  Silence. He can see directly into the bedroom. It's quiet. Too quiet. He notices a lampshade on the floor.    Two Chicago police cars wheel to the curb, COPS move quickly to the house.   Hang on, babe... going to be all right.  Her fingernails dig into Kimble's arm, trying to hold on.    The Cops enter the house. See the .38 lying on the floor. Covering each other, they move quickly up the stairs - guns drawn.    Kimble, numbed by the event, washes the blood off his hands in the kitchen sink. A cop takes his blood-stained tux jacket, and another hands him a parka.    The street is filled with Chicago police cars, curious neighbors, television news vans, etc.  Kimble is helped into a police car as the coroner's van arrives. He pauses a moment to watch as we hear.   It was .38... I think. I only saw it for a second. I knocked it out of his hand.  As Kimble is questioned we INTERCUT WITH flashes of the murder scene being processed:    Forensics technicians photograph the .38 at the base of the stairs.   Yes.   A .38 Smith.    What's going on here? This guy was trying to rob us.  The two cops stare at Kimble.   You guys have got to be out of your minds. I didn't kill my wife!  He gets up to go. A cop blocks his path. He turns and looks at Kelly.    Kimble lays on his bunk. Thinking...   I know what I saw, Walter.   I didn't kill my wife.    A crime scene photograph.    On the stand. He finishes his moving description of the events. We see some of the jury has been moved.   ... And I was holding her when the officers came in.  Gutherie returns to his seat. The Prosecutor moves to the jury. He begins slowly but his questions pick up strength.   I can't be sure. We were, mostly on the floor, fighting... I couldn't -   No. As I explained -   I don't know -   She didn't -   Look...    He remains silent. Kimble is pulled gently to his feet by bailiff. Gutherie whispers an \"I'm sorry.\" Kimble doesn't hear it.   Look out!  Too late... Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into Young Guard's gut.  Prisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster. As the gun comes out, Young Guard gets a hand on it. A SHOT FIRES...  Jolting Old Guard. He chambers his shotgun. Kimble hits the floor. The Old Guard jams a key into the cage door and surges inside, but...  Prisoner #1 broadsides Old Guard. SHOTGUN DISCHARGES... Opening a big Gainsburger hole in the driver. He sinks under the steering wheel. A knee hits the accelerator.  The CAGE DOOR SLAMS locked behind the Old Guard.   He isn't going to make it unless he gets to a hospital. Fast.    A second SHIVER ripples through the bus, stronger. Kimble retracts his hands to touch a metal panel - and feels a growing vibration.   Just where the hell are we?  The Old Guard feels it too. He gets down on his knees and looks out one of the shattered, barred windows.   It's locked. Where're your keys?   Which one? This? This one?!  Old Guard gulps a nod. Kimble jams a key in the lock. Throws the door open. Grabs Young Guard.   Help me get him -  But Old Guard climbs right over Kimble's back and climbs out the shattered windshield.      His wound bathed in orange antiseptic wash, three stitches already in. With pair of forceps he picks up the needle as he sutures himself.   Can you hear me, sir?  No response. The man is out of it. Kimble backtracks to the patient's closet and opens it. Hanging inside we see his clothes. He removes them and notices the man's untouched breakfast tray.   What's he look like?  The Trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down Kimble's cheek.   Every time I look in the mirror ... but without the beard.  They laugh.   Excuse me...   Here...  Kimble helps clear the wheels so the collapsible gurney comes free.   How is he?  The Paramedics move him toward the ramp.   Tell the E.R. doctor he's also got a perforated spleen.  He's gone... The two Paramedics share a look as they whisk the Young Guard inside.    Suddenly sees the helicopter setting down ahead of him at the mouth of the tunnel.  Kimble slams on brakes and turns to retreat.    Comes to a stop, blocking traffic in both directions. Immediately HORNS begin BLARING.   I didn't kill my wife.    Water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of Barkley dam disappearing into a veil of mist below - a great cauldron of mists. No rocks. None visible at least.  He hears the MARSHALS behind him - COMING CLOSER.      Helen exiting Kimble's car the night of the murder. She looks back at Kimble, framed by the door frame, ant smiles.   Walter Gutherie please.   Some soup, please.   Which way are you going?  She smiles and points in the direction her car is traveling. They hold a look as we hear:   Walter. It's Richard.   I wasn't worrying about appearances, Walter.   I'm not turning myself in. I need money.  Gutherie is silent. When he speaks again his speech takes on the lawyerly tone of a man who's covering his own bases.    St. Louis.   How're you doing, Charlie?   Yeah. And I need your help.   I need some money. Whatever you've got on you.   I'll call you.  Kimble glances around, the area is still clear. He looks back into the car and doesn't see the police car turn the corner and come up the street behind them.  Nichols finds his wallet ant hands all the cash he's got to Kimble, who quickly pockets it.   Thanks, Charlie...   Good morning.  As he turns to leave we hear:    Gerard walks through Kimble's house. The art and most of the furniture is gone. Books are in boxes and shopping bags around the room. Plastic covers the remaining pieces of furniture.  Gerard stares at the empty walls. Shadows on the walls show where the art once hung. Gerard pauses, tries to absorb the place. He takes a book from one of the bags and looks at it.   No. 34/34.    Photographed.   They said he's sick.   Uhhh. No they didn't.    Asshole.  She looks back at Kimble.   Nothing.  Anne keeps moving off toward trauma hall. He watches her turn the corner to the trauma hallway.    The one-armed man's arm coming off in the fight.    No... I've got to clean the blinds in the office. Want me to wait till you're finished?   Fine.   Yes, I did.   Excuse me. I was having a bad shift.  They laugh. They reach ground level and step out together.   Lots of them over the years. Here, long ago. Hasn't changed much.    Afternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows. Sheets of Prosthetic Clinic patient material are spread over Kimble's bed, floor. Kimble searches through the documents, making notes. He studies photos of attachments. Cable attachments. Joints. Electronics. Pins. straps... looking for a key to the identity of the one-armed man.  Finally he stops. He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it on the bedside table and moves to sink. He wets a towel and covers his face.  Draws a cool damp breath. Lays back on bed amid the Prosthetic Clinic material.    Kimble yanks the wet rag from his face, his senses alert. Listening, he hears: FOOTSTEPS are real, just outside and MOVING TOWARD him.    Unmarked police cars in front of the house, looking, moving his way.    Kimble SEES the Punk Kid try to escape out the back. He runs, sees cops and runs toward Kimble's basement door, actually reaching it before he is caught by the cops and pulled away.    Moves toward the front window and watches cops lead the Punk Kid out to the car.  POLICE RADIOS call the other cops to stand down.  Kimble moves slowly to his front door. Looks out.    Cops put the young man into an unmarked police car. His grandmother, the Polish woman, follows them, crying.    Two cops talk outside the Prosthetic Clinic.    He wheels the Boy's gurney into an elevator. The doors close.   Hey. Hey!  A Surgeon pauses and eyes Kimble's janitor suit and the gurney.   They just sent this one up.  He takes a look at the Boy's chart and grabs the X-rays and yells to O.R. nurse.   Wrong...  He backs up and tries another file.   Seventy-five. Hell, yes.  Kimble types in another defining characteristic... Residence: Illinois.  Again he waits. Rattles the blinds to make it seem like he's cleaning. The list shortens.   What else?    The fight with the One-Armed Man.    Something has clicked in his memory.    Kimble fights the One-Armed Man. He wrenches the man's prosthetic arm.     Kimble wrenches it and it BREAKS.   What do you mean?   It's a hobby of mine -   What do you want?  She reaches him.   I'm a janitor. I did what I was told.    Anne and Gerard stand in the hallway. Gerard studies the I.D.   Yes... This is Dr. Elway at Cook County. I'm doing follow-up work for the Prosthetic Clinic on Matthew Zelick...  He did... I'm terribly sorry. No, I'll correct our files. Thank you.  He scratches through another name. Three left. He dials another number.    The next name is \"Clive Driscoll.\" Kimble on phone, waits for answer.   Hello... looking for your brother, Clive. This is Ted Riley with the high school reunion committee. Believe it or not, 25 years is just around the corner, and Clive's on our list of lost souls. Information gave me a number, but when I tried it...  WIDER to reveal Kimble on the pay phone. The scrap of paper is his list-of-five.   No kidding?... Armed robbery.  He's where?   Clive Driscoll.  The Clearing Officer spins his clipboard around.   Sorry. I made a mistake.   Officers - there's a man in the stairwell waving a gun and screaming.  The two cops rush to stairs and Kimble immediately moves toward the doors, fast but not running. Hoping to cloak himself in civilians.    Enters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the outside. The big man sizes up the situation, realizes Kimble is fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door - trapping him partially inside the revolving door.  Other doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees Gerard.  Kimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists - but slowly the crack widens. Gerard bulls through the crowd, shoves a man out of his line of fire.    Across the street.    Kimble struggles with the one-armed man.    Kimble struggles with intruder. This time we see his face clearly. It is Sykes.    Looks up. He's found the man he's looking for but also a new possibility - that the murder wasn't just a random act of violence.  Kimble digs through Sykes' top desk drawer. His mind reeling. He stops:    Do you remember what I told you in the tunnel?     Remember what you said to me?   You said, 'I don't care.'     Well, I am trying to solve the puzzle, Gerard and I just found a piece.  Kimble takes the phone and bangs it down onto a table and we realize he is in Sykes' kitchen.   This an R.D.U.90 patient?  Kimble looks up at the Resident as we...   It's very important I reach him.    Can you talk?   I found him, Charlie. I found the guy that killed Helen.   It's all about a drug, Charlie. They tried to kill me because of a drug.   Devlin-MacGregor and Lentz. Lentz was supervising the R.D.U.90 protocol. He knew I'd found out the drug had problems. It's Lentz.   I need your help. Call Mr. Roosevelt and tell him I'm coming in.   You too, Roosevelt... Been a long time.  Roosevelt closes the door behind them.   Thanks, Roosevelt.   I loaned you something once, Kath, and I need them back.   Half the people in the study were indigents. No follow-up, no baseline on them. Who could say they didn't come into the study with bad livers?   - drug induced hepatitis.   Cold normal.   That's statistically impossible.   They'd be home free if I hadn't been leaning on them to account for the livers I was seeing. And I wouldn't have seen the livers if I hadn't told the guys on my service to call me when they had cases that were bleeding excessively in surgery.   Why not? He's one of the original patent holders. Toss the samples I sent, replace them with healthy samples, issue the path report on the healthy stuff-piece of cake.  Kimble notices something in the report.   When did Lentz die?   Because a good third of the samples Lentz approved were signed after he died.  Kathy comes to look at the report. Lentz's signature is on reports dated October, November, December.   Someone else used Lentz's name.   They wouldn't have had the access. They would have needed someone at the hospital.  Kimble opens the Devlin-Macgregor prospectus he took from the medical library and opens it to the beginning. A photo gets his attention.  He takes the bag and starts for the door.   To see an old friend.    Sits in the front car. There are very few other riders.  A man with newspaper sits across the car reading. The headlines facing Kimble say: \"KIMBLE IN CHICAGO\". Kimble's booking photo stares back at him.  Kimble reacts to the headline, looks away as the man turns the pages.  The man looks over the newspaper at Kimble, then goes back to reading. A moment later he folds the paper back to the front page.  The man looks up from the paper and looks at Kimble again, then down.  Coolly the man folds the paper, tucks it under his arm, stands, looks through the car, then moves into one of the rear cars.  Kimble looks out the window - hoping desperately for his car to reach the station. He keeps his head turned until the man is gone.    The train is not yet to the station. He has no escape. Sykes moves toward him.   Good, it's my stop, too.  Suddenly the door behind Sykes opens and the Transit Cop enters.    Sykes is thrown forward toward Kimble who holds onto a bar for balance.    Sykes is thrown to the floor - the gun slips from his grasp. Kimble moves for the gun as Sykes comes up, catches Kimble in the stomach, knocks him back. The fight carries on throughout the car.  Kimble reaches the gun first, lifts it in his left hand and aims at Sykes. Sykes sees the gun in Kimble's hand and almost smiles.   Not as easy as Helen, was it?  You missed your stop.  He moves to the front of the car with Sykes' and the Transit Cop's guns out. People back out of his way. He moves to where the first two windows extend over the platform, kicks out the front window and...   What's wrong, Charlie? Surprised?  Kimble begins moving down the aisle past the tables of doctors toward the podium.  We see the faces of Kimble's colleagues and friends from the ballroom sequence earlier. At first no one notices Kimble but as he makes his way toward the dais, the applause fades and then room quiets. Whispers of:   After Lentz died, you were the only one that had access to the pathology reports.  Nichols remains calm.   You switched the samples and falsified the reports so R.D.U.90 could get approval.   I have a set of the original samples.  Nichols stares at Kimble and for the first time we see a flicker of concern.   You almost pulled it off, Charlie. But I know all about it now, and I can prove it.  Nichols and Kimble hold a look. Nichols turns to the audience.   Ladies and gentlemen. My friend, as you can see, is obviously not well. Richard, if you want to talk -   I didn't come here to talk  Nichols leaves the dais and heads toward the exit.  Kimble tracks along with him - moving through the tables - passing the table with the Devlin-MacGregor board of directors. They are disturbed by this situation.   You missed your chance, Charlie...  Nichols charges Kimble, but Kimble drives him back with two crushing blows that send Nichols down the stairs.  Kimble moves down the stairs after him - passing under a security camera.   You took everything away from me... for money.   I want to know, Charlie... was it worth it...?    Who slams Nichols hard against the glass. The WIRED GLASS CRACKS and bellies with the form of their bodies.  Nichols' head rocks from the impact.  The GLASS GROANS. The wire stresses. The caulking begins to drop.  Nichols struggles but Kimble has him in control. Slams him down hard again.    Notices the swinging bags, follows Nichols' trail. He stops to get his bearings, sees shadow at the far end of the room between the two washers. Kimble closes in, moving between the large conveyors.    He moves to end of washers, using the machines as cover.  He sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the dryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt him when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker.  Kimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a voice from the other end of the laundry.    Moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near the conveyor belts.    Listening. He watches the movement of bags as he did with Nichols.    Realizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move.    Starts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His shoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed.   Hey, Chuckles...  Nichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick and clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor behind Gerard.   I thought you told me 'you didn't care.'",
        "Newman": "Yes, sir...   Uh, just want me to wait here, sir?    Clearly unnerved by the screaming woman, Newman opens door off the living room. The door opens into a smaller bedroom. He steps into -    Copeland listens but gets no response from Gerard. He backs through the second bedroom door, pulling Newman into the -   My ear... I can't hear a thing out of it. I can't believe you did that!   Yes. You could've missed! You could've killed me!   Terrible. I probably have permanent hearing damage.   On the night of his wife's murder, Kimble attended a hospital benefit sponsored by Devlin-Macgregor Pharmaceutical - Sykes' company.  Gerard places a Devlin-Macgregor card onto his board.   Instead of looking like a robbery gone bad, Kimble ends up being the one accused...   Why? To share the blame? He'd still go to prison.  Gerard moves to the board. He takes down a card.    Why do I get all the great jobs?   Anybody down in pathology who might know something about the guy?  Betty looks at the clock, it's after 6 p.m. Dicey.   Are you Mr. Roosevelt?   Yeah, we heard. We wanted to know if he knew or had any contact with Dr. Richard Kimble?  On the mention of Kimble, Roosevelt becomes visibly nervous.    That's not what I asked, sir. I just wanted to know if Dr. Kimble and Dr. Lentz knew each other?   The old guy didn't know where he was going. But he picked up some tissue samples.   ... From a drug study. And signed for by Dr. Charles Nichols.  Renfro and Gerard exchange a look.   Nichols also knew Lentz. He was a pathologist.   C.P.D. just reported -    I've got Kimble on the roof with Nichols. Southeast exit.    Newman checks the computer board for the elevator position.    Level five.",
        "Cosmo": "",
        "Renfro": "Richard David Kimble. Vascular Surgeon. Convicted of first-degree murder in the killing of his wife. Pleaded innocent. Claimed a one-armed -   None. No previous arrests.  Poole takes up a position discreetly behind tree as Gerard unzips his fly and relieves himself.   No relatives.   Never get it.   Running outta map, Sam.  The crash site and hospital are already marked. Gerard is ready to move.   Got him.  Gerard unholsters a 40 caliber, Glock model 22.    We're movin' in.    Son of a bitch...  It's the most amazing thing he's ever seen...   We feel confident about the I.D.   Local officials were about to wet their pants to move in.    Same room.   That's an El announcement.    Perfectly.  Gerard reflects on a moment of personal satisfaction.   Was there anything in your initial investigation that would make you think Kimble would come back to Chicago.   What I can't figure is, if you were Kimble, why'd you take a major league chance of hanging around a trauma ward?  Gerard considers this as a Man passes him. Gerard notices something.   The place would be crawling with cops.  Slowly Gerard separates from the group of deputies and follows the Man down the hall.  The Man Gerard is following turns the corner to the Prosthetic hallway and realizing Gerard is following him, holds the hallway door open for Gerard.   It could take us a week to track down every one of those names.  Gerard picks up phone and dials a number.    He's in Pullman area... Fifteen seconds for location.    Holy shit. We've got a car there right now.  He picks up a phone.   He's pulling our chain, Sam. If this was the guy Kimble was looking for, why call us?   If you were Richard Kimble... Why would you hunt for a one-armed man you think killed your wife; find hint then leave him and call us?   Unless... What if you were a well respected surgeon and wanted to kill your wife? How would you do it?   How would you find him? Look in the phone book?   Through a connection.   That's an easy fix. So let's say he was in town. Did the job. Everything goes as planned with one problem.   So Kimble returns to hunt for and find the hit man.   You're underestimating the power of the good doctor. It would be his word against... Sykes'. Who would you believe?   Get help.  Gerard pins the card to the board and looks at Renfro. It says: \"NICHOLS\"   He's a security specialist at Devlin-Macgregor Pharmaceuticals.  Kimble broke into his apartment.    \"Advances in Nuclear Tissue and Pathology Research,\" by Dr. Charles Nichols.  I bet they line up to hear that one.   He was covering for Kimble.   Balbo station. That's -   There is a U.S. Marshal out there. Hold your fire!    Separated from Gerard. He hears a NOISE behind him - a bag comes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins, dodges it, gets his bearings and continues.    He steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks under the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a WHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, opening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still.",
        "Biggs": "Point of impact.  ... and branches off.   Shit.  Come on.  They drop down to the crash site. Poole ant Renfro remain with Gerard.  A state TROOPER steps into their path, but falls away when he sees Gerard's Marshall star.   DeLange Hospital. Wounded guard swears to High Holy he saw Kimble right there in the hallway. Ambulance, missing too.   O-nine-thirty. Twenty minutes ago.  Gerard redraws the circle of units. No longer are we covering a fifty-mile radius. The circle is redrawn, tightened, with the hospital as its center. The triangulation is set.    Nothing yet.   Gerard? You there?  Gerard looks for his radio, then back at Kimble - he's gone.  Instantly Gerard reaches for his ankle - and pulls a back-up piece.    In the plumbing truck. He triggers his mike.   Trains? Traffic?   What about the man he claimed attacked his wife?  Kimble pulls the notice from the board as we -   It's hinky. Man risks everything to find a man his own investigators say doesn't exist. Something's really hinky about this thing.  Gerard looks at Biggs as they reach the elevators.   It's five flights!    Here he comes...   I'd hire a pro. Sight unseen.   Like a pharmaceutical company. Someone in security.   But Sykes claims he was out of town.   ... tried, convicted...   So what does Kimble do next?   Just what I want to do before dinner.   We're United States Marshals. We're trying to find out some information about a pathologist, named Lentz. He used to be on staff here.  Roosevelt suddenly goes on the defensive.   I think you're lying to us.  Roosevelt looks from one marshal to the other as we:   Conflicting reports, but the cops are considering him a shooter.  Heavily-armed CPD units pull up. Gerard stares at the police presence. He starts toward the hotel where Kelly is conferring with Kevlar-decked police captain.   C.P.D. has the perimeter, hotel security has the parking structure.    Keep and eye on him. Biggs has roof plans.   There are four exits to the roof.   Watch your head, Dr. Kimble.  Newman climbs in behind the wheel. Gerard in the back next to Kimble. He leans out the window and motions to Poole.",
        "Detective": "Can you give us a little more to go on besides the fact that he had an artificial arm? What kind of gun was it, Doc?   Do you own a gun, Dr. Kimble?   What kind of gun?   Did you have your key with you tonight, Dr. Kimble?   Your wife was loaded wasn't she? I mean, she was worth quite a bit of money.   Let's start over, Dr. Kimble. What'd you have for breakfast?    On the stand.   No forcible entry was found. From the beginning of the investigation, it did not appear to be a break-in. Nothing was missing.    The Punk Kid is handcuffed to a bench as a cop works on a report. Suddenly the Kid notices something that gets his attention.",
        "Kelly": "Can you give us a little more to go on besides the fact that he had an artificial arm? What kind of gun was it, Doc?   Did you have your key with you tonight, Dr. Kimble?   Your wife was loaded wasn't she? I mean, she was worth quite a bit of money.   Let's start over, Dr. Kimble. What'd you have for breakfast?    On the stand.   No forcible entry was found. From the beginning of the investigation, it did not appear to be a break-in. Nothing was missing.   As of this morning Chicago P.D. was alerted to the reappearance of Richard Kimble.   Police units have also increased patrols around homeless shelters and mass transit stations in the city.   Not that we found.   Right... You ever been downwind of a stockyard when the breeze is blowing? That's where we were sitting when Richard Kimble told that one...   If this guy existed believe me someone would've found him.   Okay. I want it locked down. Start on the lower levels.  The captain moves off. Gerard intercepts the cop.   Not since he took down one of ours, Gerard. This is a police matter, now. Stay, the hell, out of it.  Kelly moves off. Gerard watches him a moment then he looks up to the roof. Newman hands Gerard his belt with his backup piece.   Bring him down.",

        "Gerard": "Good lord...   Biggs, your turn to babysit Newman.   How ya doing? Who's in charge?   Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard.    Aware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff.   With all due respect, may I suggest check-points starting at a 15-mile radius on I-57, I-24, Route 13 east of -    Well, shit, Sheriff, I'd hate for that to happen... So, I'll be taking over the investigation.   By authority of the Governor of the State of Illinois and the office of the United States Marshal, 5th District Northern Illinois...  Poole produces State and Federal authorization documents from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff.   Please, ladies and gentlemen, step back and give this poor man some room.  Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a change of story and command.  Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near.   (friendly, to Old Guard Always an interesting thing when we find leg irons and no legs in them who held the keys, sir?   Would you be so kind as to show them to me, sir?  Gerard's large hand extends palm up at the Old Guard.  The Old Guard pats his pockets, comes up empty. He eyes the press hovering just out of earshot.   Second chance.  Poole reopens the file of photos in front of the man.  The Old Guard can't take it - points to Kimble's photo.   Thank you.   Renfro - Take that bus apart. I want an accurate body count. Poole - Set up operations right here.  He stops and looks into the TV lights and starts moving downtrack. The media and State Police move with him like Israelites behind Moses.   Ladies and gentlemen... our fugitive's been on the run for ninety minutes. Average foot speed over uneven ground - barring injury is approximately four miles an hour, giving us a radius of six miles. I want a hard-target search of any residence, gas station, farmhouse, henhouse, doghouse and outhouse in that area. Check-points go up at 15 miles.  You got that? Good. Now, turn those damn things off and get out of our way.    Type it and match it against all four prisoners.  Renfro, get an I.D. fax on Kimble to every local hospital.  Newman...  Newman appears.   I need some coffee.  As Newman steps off, everyone turns at sound of SHOUTING from the train crash.   Hit me.  Renfro and Poole lay out the details. The download of information comes clear and fast.   Let's not retry the case. Priors and accomplices?  Gerard steps up the hillside out of sight of the investigation to take a leak. Followed by Renfro and Poole.   Sealed juvie record?  Poole calls out from behind tree.   Relatives? Children?   Girl friends? Ex-wives? Friends? Combinations of the above?   Start there. Authorize taps. Cover his lawyer first.   Bet me.  Renfro won't take it.   Have Stevens go to Judge Rubin, he'll sign 'em.  ... Biggs charges up the hillside.   Give me a time.   Just the way we want it. Okay, people, let's button up.  They move off to waiting State Trooper cars and helicopter.   Seal it up.   Okay, ladies and gentlemen hard part's over.  He starts into the tunnel.   Biggs, Renfro with me.   Channel Three.  They conform their radios. Splitting up, Biggs and Renfro go left. Gerard - straight ahead.    Got a possible here. Stand by.  He stows his light but hangs onto the Glock. Bracing with three limbs   So, you didn't kill your wife.  Not my problem.  An adrenal beat. For a moment they hold a look. Then the silence is broken by Gerard's radio.   Straight ahead!   Turn around, hands over your head. And get down on the ground.  For a moment Kimble eyes Gerard.   Your choice, Kimble...  Kimble turns his back on the Marshals, stares again at the water. Slowly he puts his hands over his head. Gerard puts up his gun and pulls his handcuffs. He moves through the water toward Kimble.   Get down on your knees.  Kimble bends slowly, stares down into the falls, hears the footsteps get closer, then does the unthinkable. He jumps.    He stands at the mouth of the tunnel staring down. He stares down into the mists. Impressed. It has told him something invaluable about this fugitive.   Lights and generators are coming, Captain.   Then find me the fish that ate him.  He turns and heads to a waiting helicopter.   I bet they were.  Where's the woman?    Okay... I'll take front. Biggs and Renfro, rear. Poole, handle support. I don't want anyone hurt. Stay outside unless called. Radios on three.  The deputies prepare their weapons. Newman checks his service issue .38, stares at Gerard's Glock.   Hell, no. You're with me, Newman. Let's go.   U.S. Marshals. Down! Down!    Motions Newman to the left to check the door off the living room while he moves down the main hall into the back bedroom.    He hears Copeland moving somewhere in the front of the house.    Keeps moving down the hallway, through first bedroom, pauses at door to the second bedroom and chooses his course.   Shut up.  She does. Immediately.   You think I should have bargained with him, don't you?   Yeah, you're absolutely right. I could've.  They hold a look.   How bad's your ear?   Let me see it.  Newman leans toward him. Gerard speaks into his ear.   I don't bargain.  Gerard leaves. Newman watches him - realizing what a truly unsettling man Gerard is.   Call them back. Tell them you've made a mistake.    Stop it there.  Renfro hits play. Kimble's VOICE is heard again:   Drop the voices.  Renfro removes the two voices. What comes up are the   Listen.   More... there's a voice in the background.  At first the sound is unrecognizable. A BELL. GRINDING MECHANICAL. Then a P.A. VOICE on the tape: \"Next stop Merchandise Mart.\"   And there's no E1 in St. Louis. Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Kimble is in Chicago. Poole, get his artwork out to local police and have C.P.D. check the shelters... Biggs, bring in the detectives that handled his case.  Instantly the room is in movement.   No.  Stevens stops.   They don't know he's alive and as far as Kimble knows we don't either. I want to keep it that way as long as we can. Are we clear?  The whole group sense Gerard's intensity in regard to Kimble.   Noah... go to my office and let's officially take Dr. Kimble out of purgatory.    The place is humming now. Detectives Kelly and Rosetti sit in front of Gerard. Gerard studies Kimble's file. Renfro sits in.    Gerard looks at the two detectives.   Gentlemen, I appreciate the cooperation of the Chicago police...  He moves toward them.   What about lady friends?    He raises an eyebrow.   Where was this?   Did he ask you for help?   Why do you think he came back to Chicago?   I didn't ask you that, sir. I'm sure he was trying to protect you from having to lie for him.  Gerard continues to move around the room, study prints, books, drawings, awards and photos.   If you're really his friend, you'll help us bring him in unharmed.   Dr. Nichols, last year the U.S. Marshals' office closed out 11,003 warrants... 10,975 of those were captured. The twenty-eight others thought they were smarter than us... Now they're dead.  Nice car.  Gerard puts the photo down.   Stay on him.   A man posing as a janitor orders an emergency operation and all you do is pull his I.D.?   So, you weren't aware that when he escaped he was being transported to Menard State Prison to begin a term of life imprisonment.   For murdering his wife.  Clearly this is news to Anne. Gerard almost smiles at her surprise.   Thank you for your help, Doctor.  He moves to the position Anne saw Kimble with the kid's gurney. Trying to imagine what Kimble was doing at that place. Renfro and the other deputies converge.   Thank you, sir, I think you already have.  We see the Man has a prosthetic arm and that they are outside the door marked: \"PROSTHETIC CLINIC\"   The onearmed man. Missing the right or left hand?   Location of the attachment.    Stevens... I've got a list of names I want searched for criminal history.    We need to see a prisoner.   I hate that word.  He hits the up button.   Where're the damn stairs?   Then you wait.  He finds the door and starts up.    Climbing the stairs. He reaches a landing - and skims shoulders with Kimble, who pivots past on his way down.  Amazingly, neither man reacts. Not yet.  One flight above, Gerard's subconscious taps him on the shoulder and brings him to a dead stop. He leans over the stairwell railing to spy...  Kimble spiraling downward. From this vantage, it could be any dark-haired man. But still...    Kimble.  Others look up out of curiosity... but not Kimble. Two landings below, he falters a step, then tries to regain his step, keeps moving.  But Gerard is pulling his Glock: The hitch in Kimble's stride told him everything.   Kimble!  Kimble blitzes down the stairs. Gerard moves after him.   U.S. Marshal! Get on the phone, call your commander, tell him there's a top-fifteen warrant in the building. Go.  He shoves the cops out of the way and pounds downstairs.    Bursts out the stairwell door after Kimble.   Kimble. Stop!  But there's only one way of stopping Kimble.   Down. down. everybody down!  With adrenal effort, Kimble wrings his body through the opening...   Kimble. Stop!  It's Kimble's nightmare coming true. If he could chew off his leg right now, he would. He pulls at his foot just as   Open the doors!  Gerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the glass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor. It's bullet-proof glass. THROUGH the glass he sees Kimble rush across the street and disappear into the parade.  Doors open and Gerard and his men follow.  But Kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations outside. Blending in with the marchers.   Renfro, Biggs...  They follow him into...   This is Gerard.   You told me, you didn't kill your wife.   I remember you were pointing my gun at me.     That's right, Kimble... I'm not trying to solve a puzzle here. I'm just the poor working man that's paid to hunt you down.  The room is filling up with deputies. Poole, Biggs, Stevens, Newman.  Gerard watches the numbers as the second digit locks in.   Kimble?  Kimble leaves the phone on the table and walks out.    You can't control this thing, Kimble... Kimble?  He thinks he hears FOOTSTEPS over the phone, realizes Kimble has not hung up. What's Kimble doing?    Where is he?  Renfro looks up from the address to Gerard, stunned.   Let me see the negatives.  The Tech hands him the strip of negative film. Gerard holds it up to the light.   One's missing.  Gerard stares at the photo as his RADIO SQUAWKS.   You had a break-in, Mr. Sykes.   My name is Gerard. U.S. Marshal's Office.  Sykes is caught off guard.   This morning a fugitive named Richard Kimble made a call from your apartment.  Sykes is dumbfounded.   Would he have a reason to?   What kind of business are you in, Mr. Sykes?   Independent?   Any idea why Kimble would be interested in these?   By all means.  Sykes moves off and Gerard pockets the Lentz/Sykes photo.   Kimble said he's putting together a puzzle. We don't need to put it together too, we just need to be there when he gets to the next piece.  Gerard stops and looks back at Sykes' apartment.   Keep somebody on him. If he moves I want to know.    The group of deputies and Gerard assemble around Gerard's information board. They've come armed with facts and theories. Gerard orchestrates the information.   Stevens, check phone records for Sykes and Kimble.  Gerard moves to the door and Renfro follows. As he's leaving he hands the photo of Lentz and Sykes to Biggs.   Find out who this guy is.  He leaves. Biggs hands the photo to Newman.   Doctor. Could I have a minute?  He opens the door to an empty meeting room.    Dr. Kimble hasn't come back to you for help, has he?   Dr. Nichols. Do you know the other man in the photograph?  Nichols stops, looks at Lentz and lies.    Gerard at his board. The cards form a triangle: Sykes Devlin-Macgregor - Lentz with Kimble at the apex. He stares at the board. Poole comes to the door.   Tissue samples?  Gerard goes to his board. Renfro listens on the speakerphone.    Get CPD to bring in Sykes.  Gerard stares at the board.    Gerard stares at his board. Stevens comes to the door.   All right. It was a thought.  He goes back to the board but Stevens isn't finished.   Kimble called Sykes.  Renfro! Get C.P.D. to bring in Sykes!    Poole! Bring me Kimble's arrest report, now.  No, Stevens... I believe you.  Poole enters with Kimble's arrest transcript. Gerard takes the transcript as Renfro appears at the door.    The report comes off the scanner.    Poole, get Biggs and Newman.  They're gone as we -    Renfro driving, Gerard and Pool in car. Report comes over the radio.    Damn...   I heard. Was it Kimble?   That's my man in there, Kelly.   C'mon, I know where he's going.  He moves into the hotel with his deputies.   Let them keep busy down below. Newman, get with security. See if you can locate Kimble from the monitors. Keep in radio contact.  Newman branches off to Hotel Security. The rest follow Gerard to the rooftop elevators.   I want them covered.   This way.    Clear the hallway.  Get that door open.  The door opens and Gerard moves quickly through the hospitality suite for the rooftop.    Stay at this door.  He moves through the door to the roof alone.    Gerard hits the bottom of the fire escape and follows.    This is a United States Marshal. Get that helicopter out of here!    Charges toward -    Pulls up.   Kimble!  Kimble slams Nichols one more time against the glass and the wire holding the glass gives way, sending Kimble and Nichols into...    Kimble's car disappears into the darkness.    Where did the elevator stop?   Get out of here.  He and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry worker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead rail. A hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off switch raises the bag on a yellow steel I-beam. The worker takes one look at Gerard and abandons his station.  Gerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the main room.    We're going in. Give me five minutes. Keep C.P.D. out.  He draws his Glock, opens the door and enters the main room.    Kimble!  Kimble reacts to Gerard's voice, moves away.    The door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro.  They enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves up the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both move slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated equipment.   ... There is no way out of here.  The building is locked down.   Kimble... I know about Nichols. I know about Sykes. Kimble stops.     ... Nichols borrowed your car the night of the murder and called Sykes from it.    Moving through the forest of massive bags.   ... That's why there was no forced entry at your house. He'd used your keys.    Moves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He dodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can see straight back toward the washers.   Kimble... Come meet me out here.    Oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor belts. He makes one last appeal.   It's time to quit running... if you don't, you know I'll stop you. He listens, there is no answer.    Moves into the alley between the two giant washers. He pauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back on us...    Turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble with Nichols at his feet, unconscious. He realizes instantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun.  Kimble, exhausted, leans against the washer.  They hold a look as deputies and police flood into the room surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him.    Get them back.  The marshals ant cops clear a line for Kimble to get into a waiting car away from the media. Biggs opens the back door and helps Kimble inside.    Poole, you got that thing?  Give me your hands.  Kimble pauses, then holds up his wrists and Gerard unlocks Kimble's handcuffs.  Poole hands an ice-pack over the seat. Gerard places the pack on Kimble' 9 bruised and battered hands.   Take care of those hands, Doc, you're going to need them again soon.   Yeah, well, don't spread it around.  They share a look of mutual respect as the car pulls away.",
