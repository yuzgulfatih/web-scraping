        "Cassidy": "Sorry, guys, she's on break.  There's nothing like experience. I've done things your little fiancee's never dreamed of...  I got this. It's okay.  Thanks a lot. That was 200 bucks just walked out.  Did I ask for help? Did I need help?  Then don't fuckin' help.  That's okay.  Good to see ya, man.  Million and a half? Shit.  You never know who's in that crowd.  Jesus.  You're bleeding.  You okay?    What's that from?  Ow. Fuck.  Doesn't it hurt?  \"He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His wounds we were healed.\"  It's from \"Passion of the Christ\". You never seen it?  Dude, you gotta. It's amazing.  It's, like, so inspiring. They throw everything at Him. Whips, arrows, rocks... Just beat the living fuck out of Him for the whole two hours. And He just takes it.  The sacrificial Ram...  Ah, shit.  Just gimme for three.  You'll wait `til I'm done?  Hey, sweetie. You're back soon.  I'm working.  You okay?  Sure. What's up?  Randy, I can't leave with a customer.  Shit. When?  You can't talk here?  Randy, I don't do that.  Where are you parked?  Go to your car. I'll meet you out there in 15 minutes.  That's okay.  I'm sorry. That's fucked up, dude.  When was it?  You okay?  Good, good. What happened?  Oh, man. That's terrible.  That's funny.  Damn. What are you gonna do?  It just happened. You don't have to figure everything out this second. Give yourself some time.  You really shouldn't be alone right now.    I feel bad what happened. But you and me... I can't go there.  You should be with family now. You have a daughter, right? Where is she?  It doesn't matter. You need her.  Everybody needs a father. Trust me.  I'm sorry. I gotta get back in.  You take care of yourself.  You gonna be okay?  I'm sure.  You should.  Exactly.  You're gonna be just fine.  Would you like a lapdance, sweetie?  Would you like a lapdance?  Hey. How ya feeling?  How'd it go with your daughter?  Yeah?  You sure?  Shit. That sucks.  It's tough. You can't give up. You gotta keep trying.  That's a great idea! What's she into?  How old is she?  What kind of music does she like?  Is she into books? Cooking?  How could you not know? She's your daughter.  She's 22? Okay... You should get her some clothes, some kinda clothes... All girls like that.  I know the perfect place. This kick- ass little vintage shop in Westfield.  Saturday's the best time to go. That's when they get the new stuff in, all these boxes full of great shit.  I'll write it down.  I'm pretty sure it's on 28.  You got it.  Listen...  How `bout I meet you there Saturday? Help you out.    No problem. You got it.  Hey.  \"Clean\"?  Gee, thanks.  Oh-kaay...  Pam. But don't get used to it.  Do you know her size?  Could you see her in this?  What about this?  So like, what is she? Goth? Punk? Hippie? Preppy? Stoner?  Yeah?  You're welcome.    I agree.  You found it.  Okay, I'll give you that.  Look, I...  I gotta get going.  I really can't. I got a kid at home.  Boy. Daniel.  Nine.  It's not something I usually tell customers. Not exactly a turn-on.  That's very nice of you. Thank you.  Really?  One beer.  I think so.  He sure doesn't get it from his douchebag father.  Just this condo thing, down by Trenton.  Working on it. It's a great area. Way cheaper. And the schools are awesome.  I'm done. I'm quitting.  Where?  This isn't a dance place.    Is this a lapdance I'm getting?  I think we can get you a shift.  Pour some sugar on me! C'mon fire me up! Pour your sugar on me! I can't get enough... I'm hot, sticky sweet/ From my head to my feet yeah...  Fuckin' eighties, man. Best shit ever.  The Crüe...  Like there's something wrong with having a good time.  \"I'm from Seattle! I like rain!\"  No shit...  No contact with the customers.  Shit.    I should get home.  Good night.  I'll do it later when it's quiet.  That's very sweet. Thank you.  I'm glad I could help.  On 46?  Randy.  I can't do this.    I think you're awesome. You're a great guy.  You think I'm, like, this stripper, but I'm not. I'm a mom, with responsibilities. I don't think you wanna get with that.  I can't go there.  That was a mistake.  The club and the real world, they can't mix.  We didn't.  We didn't.  We didn't.  You're a customer. You're just a fucking customer. That's it. Okay? Got it?  What's that for?  Stop it.  Stop.  Fuck off.  Fuck off.  Hi.  Big Chris. Cheetah's bouncer.  Look, I'm sorry if I came off like a bitch. I didn't mean that stuff I said. You're not just a customer.  I'm sure it seems retarded, but I gotta keep that line. It's how I've been able to live with myself the last 12 years.  There's a place I'm trying to get to in my life. For me and my son.  I'm leaving that world behind. And I can't bring anybody with me who----  Where are you going?   Cassidy grabs her purse and car keys off the kitchen table.   In bed by 11. Don't let him bargain.  Bye, monkey...     Cassidy is driving south on the New Jersey Turnpike. She's on her cellphone. On the passenger seat is the Fanfest flyer.   There's waffles in the freezer and some burritos if he wants for lunch. He knows where. I'm not sure what time I'll be headed back yet. I'll keep you posted as I go.  Excuse me.  Do you know where the Civic Auditorium is?  Excuse me.  Randy.  Don't do this. This is dumb.  I thought the doctor...  You could really hurt yourself.  Out here's what counts. The real world.  I quit my job, drove 14 hours through the night to get here. What do you call that?  Randy. Please.    Randy!  Stop it! Stop it, Randy!   Cassidy can't take any more. She turns and WALKS.",
        "Nick": "Listen up, only saying it once. Vic Storm, you're up first against D- Day. Second, Shawn McPride and Funkmaster Garry B. Slick. Third, Frankie Cirillo and Rob Dynamo versus J.T. Anvil and The Ultimate Freak. Fourth, Teddy Brewski and Lex Lethal. Intermission. Fifth, Samoan Savages versus the Disco Brothers. Sixth, the Irish Warrior and Vyper. Seventh, \"Sandman\" Steve Sambuca versus Hollywood. Last but not least, for the strap, Kid Loco versus Randy The Ram. Got it? Good.  Yo, Ram. Got a sec?  Do you realize what's coming up?  May 6th...  20th anniversary of you and Ayatollah at the Garden.  I know. Time fuckin' flies.  Two words: Re. Match.  I'm doing a big Fanfest thing down in South Carolina that weekend. I wanna main-event it with you two.  Ram-Ayatollah II. 20th anniversary. Hundreds, thousands of screaming fans watching you two make history for the second time.  For this? I bet he'd be willing to dust off the old turban.",

        "The": "Raaam!  You'll get in when I get my rent.  Sure. You're good for it every time this happens.  Twenty bucks.  Whassup, yo? Randy The Ram!  We gonna see some action tonight?  Could we get a picture?  Think you could...?  Thanks a lot, yo. Kick some ass out there.   Randy SMASHING KID LOCO IN THE FACE with a flying drop-kick. Kid Loco falls to the canvas.  Randy struts around the ring, exhorting the crowd, soaking up their cheers.  Distracted, Randy doesn't notice Kid Loco peeling himself off the mat. Kid Loco sneaks up behind Randy and SMASHES HIM IN THE HEAD. Randy goes down.  Kid Loco lifts Randy up. They're both on their knees, chest- to-chest. Kid Loco steps to his feet, lifting Randy with him.  Kid Loco tightens around Randy's arms, arches his back, presses out his chest and... WHAM!! He and Randy fly with a LATERAL DROP. Randy's head hits the canvas hard as he slams down on his back.  As Randy writhes on the mat, Kid Loco HEADS FOR THE   Randy's anger builds as he watches.     Cassidy BURSTS ONTO THE STAGE. She owns it with rock `n' roll energy.     An ANNOUNCER stands with a microphone.    Randy stands quiet and peaceful, head lowered slightly.    Randy explodes into the gym, full of fire and showmanship.  He does a lap around the outside of the ring. His hand is raised high in the air, index finger and pinky curled into a set of RAM'S HORNS. Fans do the same.  Kids rush toward Randy, reaching out for HIGH FIVES. He obliges as many as he possibly can.  Fans hold out FOLDING CHAIRS in front of him. (Just like in the opening montage.) He \"rams\" each one with his forehead.    Randy looks into the envelope again and pulls out $300.  He looks at the money, chuckling ironically. It's his biggest payday in years. He tucks it in a pocket.   You alright?  Welcome home.   He raises his arms, sticking his elbows out, pressing his fists to the sides of his head to form a SET OF RAM'S HORNS.  Randy JUMPS. He flies high in the air, soaring over the mat and crashing down on The Ayatollah horns-first. He pins The Ayatollah as the ref counts to three for the victory. The crowd goes wild.     Who can I say it is?          The song begins with the sound of a ROARING STADIUM CROWD. A chant begins:   You don't have to go out there. You don't owe him shit.  Then why would you even----  Get the fuck out of here!  Obviously not.     Randy's van is pulled over on the side of the interstate.      That makes two in Columbus, one in Dayton. Next 12 months, I'd say Cincy's not out of the question.    Ram-A-Lam.  Good to see ya, bro. Didn't think we were gonna do this.  Thursday night, I get a call, \"It's on! He's back in!\" I'm like \"What?\"  What things?  Ah, we can just wing it.  It'll be fine.  How's this: I'm the heel, you're the face. Done.    Believe so.    Jesus. Relax.    That better?  Forgot how much fun this is.   The Ayatollah hops out of the ring. He stands over Randy, kicking him repeatedly. He grabs his Iranian flag, waving it tauntingly at the crowd.   Pathetic. Pitiful godless infidel!   Boos rain down on The Ayatollah.      The Ayatollah grabs the folding chair from the corner. He SMASHES RANDY OVER THE HEAD with it. Randy's forehead is BLEEDING. The Ayatollah hits him again, taking dead aim at the forehead cut. MORE BLOOD. Randy crumples to the mat.     The Ayatollah scoops up Randy and BODYSLAMS him. He falls on Randy knee-first and starts punching him repeatedly.     All you, bro. Lead the way.  If you ain't up to it...  Y'okay?  Just pin me.  Finish it. Pin me.   The Ayatollah lies on the ground in pain.",

Should get a good gate. DiFusco says he's gotten like 20 calls last two days alone.  Cookie trays were better.  Hell, yeah.  Put him down.  You're okay, buddy. Hang on.  Stay with us, bro.

        "Stephanie": "Is there someplace we can talk?  It won't take much of your time.  I'm here because...  I came to make amends.  I'm supposed to talk to people I've hurt.    Thank you. I'm sure you mean that.  I need to apologize.  For anything I've done or said over the years. All the anger at you.  Like the last time I saw you... I'm sorry for what I said.  Do you even know what I said?  What did I say?  You have no idea.  No problemo.  Same shit.  Same old shit.  I'm in the middle of saying something important and you drop it for the fucking wrestling.  It's like I'm 10 all over again.  This what?  Yeah. We're done.  This is Stephanie, you know what to do.   Randy stands at the doorstep of the house. Steeling himself, he rings the bell. A WOMAN  appears at the door in a T- SHIRT and PANTIES.   What do you want?  Now's really not a good time.  Middlesex County Community.  That's okay.  Left at the second stop sign.  You gonna talk?  Okay...  You are such an asshole.  Now you wanna fix things. Now that suddenly you're all scared and alone from your heart attack.  This is so fuckin' you. You only come around when you need something from somebody, when they can do something for you. Selfish fuck. Good. Be alone.  What are you, stalking me?  Sometimes.  Oh. Okay.  I see that. What's it for?  I do. It's... shiny.  What am I doing?  We have an old favorite spot?  Now's not the best time. I've got some things to do.  Stuff.  No.    I totally don't remember.  Thank you.   Randy stands with Stephanie in front of her house, dropping her off.   It was okay.  Bye.  Dinner?  I'm sorry. I don't think so.  Wednesday would work better.   Randy rings the bell. Stephanie's \"friend\" answers the door.    Stephanie and The Friend are arguing in the living room.   I know that.  Please leave my house.      You're such a fucking asshole.  I waited in that restaurant two hours. Two fucking hours. Just in case you showed up late. \"Maybe he got stuck in traffic. Maybe I got the time wrong\"... Nope.  You didn't fuck up. You are a fuck- up. A walking, living, breathing fuck-up.  Just please shut the fuck up. Because I can't even stand the sound of your voice.  I thought about having a drink for the first time in 11 months last night. That's what you do to me. You asshole!  Fucking piece-of-shit asshole!  Get off me!      I don't mean it?  You're right. I don't.  I don't know why I got so hysterical. There's no reason. I don't hate you. I don't love you. I don't like you. I was stupid to think you could change.  I don't care.  Doesn't matter. I don't care. I'm done. No more fixing it. It's broke. Permanently. I'm cool with it. It's better that way.  I don't want to ever see you again. I don't wanna see you, I don't want to hear you... Done. You understand?  Actually, I don't care if you understand.  Goodbye.   Randy steps out the front door. Stephanie's cellphone rings. She looks at the caller ID and picks up.   You can come home. He's gone.  This is Stephanie, you know what to do.",
        "Adam": "Randy wears a look of intense concentration. Adam makes a scrunched-up face at the screen.   What's that square?  That you're hitting me with.  That's a chair?  This is old.  That was, like, 50 years before I was born.    Coming!   Randy does a little celebratory fist pump. He hits RESET.   I gotta go.  That's okay.",

What's the matter, they raise the price of tights?  Let's see what we got.  Yeah?   Wayne looks up at Randy, mildly annoyed by the disruption. On his computer screen is an ONLINE POKER game.   Not really. What?  Only thing I got right now's got weekends.  Isn't that when you sit on other dudes' faces?  Deli counter.  All day long, hot horny housewives begging for your meat. And prepared salads.  At the moment. You interested?  Here ya go.  Guess they got it off your W-4.    Then yes.  Just wear the fucking thing.  Let's pick it up. Rush hour.  Randy!

    "description": "This is a drama about an aging professional wrestler, decades past his prime, who now barely gets by working small wrestling shows in VFW halls and as a part-time grocery store employee. As he faces health problems that may end his wrestling career for good he attempts to come to terms with his life outside the ring: by working full time at the grocery store, trying to reconcile with the daughter he abandoned in childhood and forming a closer bond with a stripper he has romantic feelings for. He struggles with his new life and an offer of a high-profile rematch with his 1980s arch-nemesis, The Ayatollah, which may be his ticket back to stardom.—Matlock-6",
