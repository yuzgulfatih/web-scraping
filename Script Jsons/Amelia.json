        "Balfour": "Ready, Mum.  I don't smoke.  If you need help, I'll be right outside. In the rain.  Mr. Putnam. Their headwinds are stronger than they knew when they took off.  I recalculated their fuel. It will cost them 9%.  I can't raise them, sir. I tried voice, and Morse Code...",
        "Amelia": "Adventurous? You've got the wrong girl, Mister. You should know that by now.  That why I get so many chances to not do it?  He thought I hated him.      He never knew I was fascinated.  I figured he'd be pompous.  I knew, of course, that he wasn't going to choose me. I had no discernible qualifications whatsoever.  But to be rejected by this... parasite. A man who had given up any life of his own to flutter near the famous.  I didn't know whether to laugh or throw something at the jerk.  Mr. Putnam?  Was that the thing you did with your hand? Sadly, I don't speak dog.  I do.  I'll make it.  Always nice to know what the real attraction is.  Why would that matter?  Was that your advice?  Except for the part that goes to you.  You said she wants a flyer.  Why would anyone want a book from a passenger?  Good for my chances, you said. What are my chan...  You're a busy man, Mr. Putnam.     I can find my way.  Fine.   What have I done?  I didn't mind waiting. Caught up on my reading. Knitted a sweater.  We.  Spoken like a gentleman.  Of course a gentleman. Would have paid for my ticket.  Courage is the price that life exacts For granting peace  The soul that knows it not Knows no release From little things  As the little red airplane passed by, it said something to me.  I don't think I've ever stopped listening.     I even had my own plane. Bought with my last dime.  Course in the early days of flying...  ...crashing was so common, you almost forgot it could kill you...  ...until it did.  Almost.  Got it.   I think.  You're just in time. Alice has come through the Looking Glass, and things are getting, well...  They are, actually.  Has to be. Competition, you know. Millionaire heiresses, hot shot girl pilots. If George knew I told you, he'd have me publicly flogged.  So long as he could sell tickets.  Marion. She's giving me a leave of absence.  Specially if I don't make it.  Well, I'll have impressive credentials as a long-distance passenger. That's not exactly a career in aviation.  'm not going anywhere, social work  You do love to look on the dark side. Whatever did you see in a sunny character like me?  What love means to you. What it requires. Is the pressure.  The problem is what it's always been. The problem is me.  George had told me Stultz was Adm. Byrd's favorite pilot, fearless, gifted. He drank. But George said it never affected his work.  When he said it, I must have had a funny look. So I just said, `Yeh, I grew up around a guy like that.'  We felt `commander' was less grandiose than, say, `empress.'    Hmmn.   What does that do to our fuel?  I wonder if it can keep them up there. Not that I've ever had enough to try.  Sorry.    I'll try keeping my mouth shut.  Careful.    I could get to like it.  Thank you, Simpkin. Thank you for everything.  It's in a book. Oh, that's right. You read the ones you publish.  There's a Beatrix Potter story about a cat named Simpkin.  He wasn't happy unless he had several mice, each under a different teacup. So he could never become bored.  THe illusion of activity was essential for him to feel at peace.  What are you boys doing over there?  Oh god, is it worth the effort?  Valentino's not available?  Two things. One, Chaplin can't play me because he's perfect for you. And two, you have company.  Popping off letters. For my dad, my mom, my sis. You know. In case.  Who else? If I do pop off, it's your fault.  Sam will handle that.   They trust him.  Have you.  But why is he you?  So you haven't actually read it. Do you actually read?    Well.   See ya.  Our first hop was to Canada, to start from as close as we could get to Ireland. Just in case we couldn't get the thing in the air and had to row.  The fuel was going to be so close, every single mile counted.  George told me to keep to my room, just in case there was a reporter or two somewhere.  Hi there, boys. How are the ham and eggs?  Now why would a famous gal like Mabel give a thought to someone like me? I don't have a single sweater made out of gold.  Hey, not even silver.  Time to fly. Get up, get dressed, we're going now.  Great. Maybe Mabel will think so, too. Because if she doesn't, she's going to Paris and you're going home. Today.  It's fine, there's a tail wind all the way, we'll off-load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind gets us to Ireland.  But this   is the day Mabel's ready, so we're   going now. The weather is going   to get better and we'll be there   to enjoy it.  Just as serious as you're hung over. You go now, get the late weather, we'll meet you at the plane.     I've loved one person unconditionally, Bill. He is the most caring and generous and charming and flat-out funny guy I'll ever know. He's my father.  He's a drunk. And he's let me down all my life.  Now you get out of that bed. And you fly that god-damned thing to Ireland. Or I swear to you, Bill...  I swear to you I will. Or die trying.  And either way. You're going to be living with it.  Good.     Slim, start the engines.  You signed a contract. You've got a direct instruction from me to go. That report indicates some degree of risk and it's a risk I'm taking.  Thanks.  Read tomorrow's papers, Bill. We'll both be in them.  So, to take off, you pull back on the thing, right?               Dearest Dad. Hooray for the last grand adventure. I wish I had won, but it was worthwhile anyway. You know that.     I have no faith we'll meet anywhere again, but I wish we might.            Out of gas. May have to swim for  Oh, yeh. Very important man.   More important than any of us.  Public relations.  No, really, this is very sweet, it's an honor. I'm actually enjoying it.  Hullo, Hilton.  I believe you've come for these.  I was a passenger on this journey. Just a passenger. Everything that was done to bring us across was done by Wilmer Stultz and Slim Gordon. All the praise...  This flight was solely to the credit of Bill and Slim. Women should know, however, that I have had 500 hours solo flying and once held the women's altitude record.  This particular flight, under these conditions, I wonder if anyone but Bill Stultz could have pulled it off. But certainly, one day a woman will do this. As easily, as skillfully, as professionally as any man.  Aviation is clear today for the pioneer. And if the pioneer has good ideas nobody will ask whether  I hear your doubt. That doubt is our challenge. This is where our Atlantic flight, or any other good flight by a woman can help...  It starts women thinking.  Guess you can burn those letters.  The book's yours.     The letters are mine.  Barely enough for one.  Well, being a social worker by trade and passion, I'll be going back to work at Denison House when all this fun is over.  ...if I haven't been fired.  So they took me home with them to Rye. And I lived there, while I wrote my book.  I thought he'd be a tyrant and that I would have to manage him.  Instead he was kind and generous. And only picked the fights he needed to win.  What does it say?   `I don't smoke but you should?'  True and misleading.      Why would I sign that?  `...in the prison yard, so everyone can watch and share in our...' Did you write the copy on this one, too?  You need more ammunition in these cards, and where's the goddamned humor, for Chrissake? By which I mean something actually funny!  And please remember not to turn your pretty little backside to the crowd when you use your pointer, it's your face they're paying to see. Well, most of them.  And another thing. Your hats. Are a menace.  I remember the first kiss.  Of course, I knew all the stories  But I didn't kiss him because I felt sorry for him. Or because it would mean the world to him.  I did it.    Because I wanted to.  It's so good to meet you. I've been following your career with a great deal of admiration.  Feel like a drink?  Relax, George. I meant a Coke.  On a bad week.                  On a good week.  The girl looks from one to the other.  All depends. On whether you want the sell or the real.  Well, good for you! I would have expected nothing less. You want a tip?  Keep doing what you're doing.  For a long, long time.  I can't do that.  I already love you.    That's why I can't marry you.  I know me.     And you don't.   Not really.  The day will come. When I will run away. And when it does...  And when were you going to tell me?  What? You think I wanted it done, but just let you do the dirty work?  Because I'm no angel. Business is competition and competition is rough, and I thank my stars that you're there making this life happen for me, but...  But this is different.  If women are going to stab women in the back, then women are going nowhere.  You did it because you love me.  And when we're married, you mustn't ever...  What's the big shock? I thought you wanted to get married.  Well, then.  You'll be destroyed. And part of me will, too. And I think we both know it.  Sometimes things happen that way. You're not better safe than sorry.  Yes?  ...I want you to understand I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me. Nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly.  If we can be honest I think the difficulties which may arise may best be avoided should you or I become interested deeply, or in passing, with anyone else.  Please let us not interfere with the other's work or play, nor let the world see our private joys or disagreements.    I will try to do my best in every way. And give you that part of me you know and seem to want.  Hence, the article.  I'm thinking of doing it solo.  Would you mind?  I'm surprised you're all right with this...  Mmm-hmmn. I was braced for the lecture. Five years since Lindbergh, no one's made it solo, so many of them died.  I was waiting to hear that I'm only doing this because I was just a passenger last time, and I'd rather die than go on living as a fraud..  I think luck has rules. And I try to respect them. My favorite is...  We make our own luck, you and I. Remember that.  No.  All this? G  Thank god, I thought you were going to tear it in half.  I put it in a letter. Which you'll get if I don't make it. So...mixed emotions, huh?  Stake up the peonies, huh? They're messy when they bloom on the ground, and...  I want to see their heads high. When I come home.  See ya.  The weather report wasn't perfect. But we knew our real chance was to take weather that others wouldn't.  I closed the deal by choosing May 20, five years to the day from Lindbergh's flight. It was too good a sell for George to resist.  ...was that my altimeter would conk out. Never to return.  The only way to have any sense of altitude, was to keep dropping toward the sea.  When the engines sputtered, that was my low-level limit.  I was too busy to grasp how impossible the situation had become. The joke was...  All those months flying only with instruments, I should have been practicing without them.  I started to wonder if luck was paying me back. For thinking I knew the rules.  Then I smelled burning oil.  I told myself, push on. After all, if it was a stupid choice...  ...no one would ever know.  With seemingly no warning, there was ice. The controls froze.  Through the spin I had one thought, it would be warmer lower, the ice would melt, I just had to regain control...  ...before I hit the water.  ...or passed out.  The ice happened twice more, and I began to lose heart. Then I remembered Lindbergh's book saying the same thing happened to him.  So I figured, if he's twice as good, I just have to be twice as lucky...  I'd read that part in George's reception room that first day. Bless him for keeping me waiting.  The cockpit gauge was defective. There was a steady trickle of fuel down my neck.  Toss-up whether the bigger danger was running out of gas or going up in a fireball. I had my answer in less than an hour, when...  The manifold weld began to separate. I gauged the likelihood of explosion at somewhere between probable and inevitable.  Excuse me, sir. Where am I?  When I left, I was aiming for Paris.  `Only an average flyer, she has pushed herself to the front by following the tactics of the feminists...  `Using a man-made perfect machine, tuned by men mechanics, trained by men flyers, on a course laid out by a man. By a lucky break she just managed to make the hop.'  Well, it reminds me how much I owe to the men of this world. Keeps me humble.  Well, they're crazy about something.  What have we really done?  That's not enough.  The World Telegram said, `a magnificent display of useless courage.'  Reasoning with me. A magnificent display of useless courage.  Imagine.  Ladies.    Thursday, I'll be in Boston. Meeting Gene Vidal and Paul Collins.  No, he's starting a shuttle service. Washington, New York, Boston...  Could be a money maker for us.    Get me off the lecture grind.  What on earth would you need me for?  Gene had a terrible marriage and was separated from his alcoholic adulterous wife. But he was too kind to humiliate her with a divorce...  As a result, he was basically a single parent to their young son, Gore.  How's Nina doing?  If you two get bored, I could tag along sometimes.  Well, yeh.  Any given meal, I can eat a lobster and have you boys in stitches.  At seven?  Are you kidding, it's a godsend. No matter how hard George and I work, how many lectures we cram in, there's never enough money for the next adventure.  Wish you'd do something about that.  I know.   Always.  He costs money, too.  We don't have to.  Thank you.  For understanding.  The wrong Roosevelt got elected.

Sorry.  When are you leaving?  I don't really see how I can.  Well, it's not just that. There's critical stage, and...I've just started as Gene's consultant at the Aeronautics Branch...  What are you trying to say?  I can't think of anything helpful.  Hi. Yeh. What's today been like?       You still okay?  I suppose I thought.      It was too revealing.  I'm so glad you have it now.  Of course. Me, too. I'll call you later.  Must be the ambience.   And the nuts.  Any guy would have to be nuts to do that. I'm considerable trouble, if you haven't noticed.  You'll see it.

I came to Washington today with the National Women's Party, to ask the President for his aid in passing the Lucretia Mott Amendment for equal rights.  And that's because I haven't needed it.  I'm the lucky one. Our Department of Commerce shows no prejudice in issuing licenses to fly. A pilot is a pilot.  How about giving the rest of our women. The ones who can be productive for their families and for our nation an equal break?  They are your sisters and your daughters. They are your wives. And fellas...  You've no excuse.

Can you women keep a secret?  Well, it's no secret that I'm a bit driven, some might say obsessive, about my little flying adven- tures...  I've decided to embark on easily the most exciting, possibly cra- ziest, ever...  I'm going to fly. Around the world.  Are you going to tell me your surprise, or do I have to get physical?  Except it would have to be an Electra, and they cost...  May as well be a billion.  And your surprise is, you robbed a bank.  Think I could help?  Cat food.    A whole case.  Dear Mr. President: Some time ago I told you and Mrs. Roosevelt about my confidential plans for a world flight. The chief problem is the jump westward from Honolulu...  As President Elliot has said, it would be a shining adventure, beckoning with new experiences. Making me more useful to the program here at Purdue.  It is much more. I believe that women should do for themselves what men have done - and occasionally what men have not.  This might encourage other women toward greater independence of thought and action. And I know how deeply you gentlemen desire that.  I know, of course, from my chats earlier in the evening. With each of your wives.  In that spirit, I want each of you to reach for your checkbooks...  I mean that quite literally. This is an opportunity for me to exhibit the quality my husband admires most.  The capacity. To be relentless.  Well, there's Magellan, 400 years And he died. And he used a boat.  Pretty much.  So why are you asking? Just to show how smart you are?  No one's tried it.    You think I should?  Dare me.  Okay.  I'll have to refuel.  In the air. One plane to another.  Well, don't you think I can?  Pretty much.  We'll play some cards before you leave.  s that an opinion or an order?  Oh, I bet there are more advantages than just that.  I've taken bigger risks.  It's your vacation home.  Don't rush me. I'm thinking.  Hullo, Fred. It's good to meet you.  This time of day, I like it with bacon and eggs.  Over easy on the eggs.      Your job could depend on it.  I'm told that mid-air refueling would be beyond my abilities.  Better odds of hitting that island?  Even with cloud cover?  They did.  My dad drank. He lied all the time. Rest his soul.  Bill just had to find Europe. We're looking for something less than two miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet.  Hey.   How can I lose?  Did I pressure the navy to build a landing strip at Howland Island? How exactly would I do that?  The airstrip has been planned for a long time. I was thrilled to learn it will be ready in time for my flight. The navy has been wonderful, as always.  Who am I to argue with `experts?' I'll just give you my plain old common-sense thinking on this...  We may not learn much about the plane, but we will about the pilot. Endurance over a month's journey, flying nearly every day. Response will make a contribution.  I'm a working stiff like all of you. I don't apologize for the fact that I need money to live. And to keep financing my flying, which is what I love. I think that's a positive example for women.  I'm not doing this as a scientist. I'm a flyer, boys, pursuing my passion. For the fun of it. The fun of it. Something I recommend as a healthy motive for women.  ...and maybe even some men.  Well, we need enough for a third pass at Howland. After you miss it the first couple times around.  ...the best that money can buy. I just can't believe I've done this never coming back.  I overreacted. The plane was too heavy, I should have used the rudder pedal instead of the throttle.  I'll make it back and more, I promise. The book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another three years.  No, it will. Our prices, our sales, are going to double.  This showed them how dangerous it all is, they were taking it for granted... They thought I was competent.  You mean after.  So my exit would be a stupid crash. publicized attempt to finally do something no man had done before.  And what if it's not something I have to show the world?  What if it's something I have to show me.  Who let you off the hook on this?  I don't have a choice. I have to reverse my route and fly east. If hurricanes in the Caribbean and monsoons in Africa...  Well, if I do pop off, I'll try to make it somewhere that's not your fault.  But I'll have Fred so I won't miss. In fact, I'm taking Fred along for this whole trip.  Giving up my little arrogance about solo. Safety first, yes?  If you're worried about his drinking, I'll deal with it.  I can handle Fred.  I'll be flying sky no one's ever been in. You made that happen.  I'll try to make you proud.  And then what?  Oh yeh.    That.  If you'll fly the plane.   Make it twenty.  Simpkin keeps many mice at one time. Each under a different teacup.

There are men who say they flew around the world, but they didn't  Ask her about the Pacific. The maximum range of the Electra is 4000 miles. And the closest land that.  Go out to the car and get Sara. Ask if she'll take you for an ice cream. Okay?  The only good thing about losing our former relationship is I feel a little freer to tell you when you're being completely crazy.  You're not a good enough pilot to not be able to control the Electra amount of time.  I've noticed. Don't be so proud of it.  This is Howland Island. It's half- way between Honolulu and New Guinea. It has no elevation, no trees, it's a mile wide and a mile and a half long. Hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists.  We're colonizing it, because when the Japanese make their move, we're going to need a refueling strip there.  Try reading the newspapers between building the runways yet. Maybe if someone I knew could get the President's attention...  It's really tiny, a grain of sand    Can you handle that?  Thanks for letting me come.  I guess I'm already outvoted.  But you're flying Howland last, when you're exhausted.  Maybe I'm obsessing on Howland because it was my bright idea, and I'd feel responsible if...  I'd appreciate that.  You miss that island. You'll be out of fuel, with 2000 miles to go.  You and Fred alone for a month...  How do you feel?",

        "George": "You may as well write it down, Mary. Write it all down. Even the parts that are confused or graceless or boring.  We'll see if I remember how to edit.  I'd kept her waiting two hours.  She was a person who cherished her privacy and was devoting her life to social work. And there I was...  Self-obsessed. Wallowing in the glory of my authors and celebrity acquaintances. A vain, fast- talking, manipulator. But then I guess you know all that, don't you?  Oh, yes. And the kind of man who fishes for compliments.  The waiting made her furious. She undoubtedly felt I was  Actually, I hadn't given her a thought. Oblivious as usual. Which, perhaps, was even worse.  Miss Earhart?  I asked you to sit.  A            Ah.   Well, stand if you like.  I'm told you want to fly the Atlantic Ocean.  In the 12 months since Lindbergh, 55 people in 18 planes have tried. Three planes made it. Fourteen people have died.  Three women died trying. Two others escaped with their lives. If you do make it, you'd be the first. Which...is the real attraction for both of us, I suspect.  The plane was bought from Adm. Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite who wanted the record for herself. Her family wouldn't tolerate the danger. She has asked for a replacement...  ...who is American, educated, well- spoken, a flyer, preferably physically attractive...  Because she wants the world to pay attention. And pretty girls command more attention.  Sure. My role is selling this event to the public. There will be a contract for the girl's story with the New York Times. Also a book to be published over her name.  Which will be as great as I can manage, I assure you.  Don't get your hopes up. The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be the pilot. There'll be a male co- pilot and navigator. The woman will be purely a passenger.  That's good for your chances. Because your level of flying experience wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would be considered for this. If the woman were to do any flying at all.  Because the hook is that we're making the woman the commander. The pilot will sign a contract saying he is under her direction and control. It's her ship, her flight.  The job's yours.  I chose you the moment you walked through the door.  Now assuming my awful manners haven't soured you on the enterprise. May I give you a lift to the station?  I honestly feel an apology is in order.  I mean an apology.   For what's coming.  I'm going to be pretty controlling these next few months. How you dress, move, cut your hair. Speak in public. It's all part of the package we're selling.  That's right. If you're not in there selling with me, it won't work.  You're the star. I'm no one at all.  Boys, I'd like to introduce your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.  Say hello to Slim Gordon your navigator.  And Bill Stultz here, simply the most talented pilot working.  We've got Byrd's pilot, we've got his plane...  Nope, those are new, personally suggested by the old man himself.  This way, if you're forced down at sea, you can wait for a rescue.  The Admiral estimates the pontoons only cut our range by 200 miles.  What I ought to try. Is listening to you once in awhile.    Trying to make you look like a girl.  Wondering who should play you in the film of all this. I'm thinking Chaplin.  Amelia Earhart, this is Dorothy Binney Putnam.  I'm honored. That you'd leave these with me.  I'll call them once you're safely on your way.  I've figured out the Simpkin thing, you know.  Sure. There are so few books I haven't published, it was easy to find.  Beatrix Potter, the Tailor of Gloucester. He's a cat in a green frock coat.  He's brilliant, charismatic...  ...neurotic, compulsive, manipulative. Am I getting warmer?  I saved them for your book.  ou're the boss.  The truth is, she was a celebrity on smaller stages all her life.  This is just when the rest of us discovered her.  Lucky Strike endorsement.      I wrote the copy myself.  It says Lucky Strikes were the only cigarettes aboard the Friendship. That's true.  So Bill and Slim get paid.  If you're too proud to take tobacco money, donate it to Byrd's expedition, and we get great publicity.  This week's marriage proposals. The top one's the most creative. It's from Sing Sing.  The lecture and publicity schedule was fierce. I was with her pretty much all the time.  This was the moment of opportunity. Could we launch her into Lindbergh status as a permanent icon, before her name fell out of the news- papers.  We had separate agendas. For her, it was the advancement of aviation and of women.  As for me, I liked to tell myself it was about the money. Though there was never much of that left over.  Really, it was about the chance to be around her.  Everything about you. Is a menace.  Amelia!   What would her mother say?  On a bad week.                  On a good week.  The girl looks from one to the other.  A 16-year-old girl sets an altitude record, then makes headlines illegally flying under the four bridges of the East River. You don't seem to need much help selling yourself.  Just so we're clear, young lady. What is your primary ambition?  Lovely party, huh?  Well, in that case, for your information, it is a lovely party indeed. Anything on your mind?  What's wrong with this one? A promising start, I'd say, in the honesty department.  Great. Let's try one about you and Fred Upton.  Well, I'm waiting for our practice conversation. Hoping I'll learn something. About honesty.  Dorothy and I are through.  It's different now.  Marry me.  If you give it a chance, you'll learn to love me.  Well, that explains it. For a minute there, I thought you were stuck for an excuse.  What if I promise not to learn?  If you love me. I'll take my chances.  Race you to bed.  I'll tell you why it's a front page story. Because Amelia pulled every woman out of the race. So the organizers had to roll over and give in, or they'd have lost their shirts. You want me to write your headline?  Call you back. I've got a very important guest.  Well, I've just got one client. And most days she's more than I can manage.  And both of those things.      Are the  I think it would be huge for women flyers if Amelia won the Derby. The publicity would put the race, and all of you, up there with the boys.  Well, the one shot would be putting her in a far more powerful plane than anything she's flown. We're thinking the Lockheed Vega.  That's why I'm thinking of you flying with her. You could handle the cross-country flying, the more difficult bits, and I'd pay you $75 a week.  There's just one thing. Obviously, it has to appear that Amelia did all the flying. So when pictures are taken, you'll stand off to one side.  You haven't changed.  Unfortunately for you, neither have I.  You can't win if you can't get a plane to enter. Let me predict that you won't.  In fact. If you reject my generosity, you may come to regret it. For a long, long time.  I'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor. And this is what my loyalty requires.  She probably meant me.  Oh, sure she does.  She just doesn't care.  My job.     Is to care for her.    he told you that I shut her out of  Never. I knew you'd go crazy.

And we're reading  Which is actually across the Atlantic.  Not at all. When would you like to go?  Really.  ell, they were only men.   This is  Of course not. But if I did...  ...all the more reason to say yes.  Elephant hair, I think you wear it on your toe. It's good luck.  Anyway. That's what the elephant told me.  Do you have money?  I spent our money on ocean liner passage to go bring you back. It's non-refundable. So try to do your part.  So the Simpkin thing. What was all that?  Either way, something to look forward to.

Cheer up.     They're crazy about you.  You've made them feel like this.  Most of them are women. And for them, it's very much enough.  The question is.

If a bomb goes off tonight, the whole government of the United States is out there...  Some dog catcher will have to become President.  Boy. Imagine if you'd actually done something.  iss.  The irony is, I'd finally put that wedding day letter out of my mind. Stopped watching every beautiful accomplished man who crossed her path.  I had a call from the Byrds. They've asked us to dinner Thursday.  Don't tell me Gene wants to resurrect Transcontinental?  Gene's a dashing guy. He could talk anyone into anything.    After Roosevelt won, his wife Eleanor brought the advancement of women to national attention with stunning success.  A gutsy gal who rode a bobsled in each morning on horseback, and carried a pistol on car trips. She possessed boundless energy, a towering intellect...  ...and was Amelia's idol. As it happened, she was obsessed with flying, making Amelia her absolute heroine. A  You have, actually. Twice.  It's all right. You've been distracted lately.  Thing is.     I'd like you to come.  I've talked to the promoters, they'll switch some lecture dates for us.  Normally, I'd be worried about leaving you here alone. But I suppose that won't be a problem, will it?  I think I've just said it.  Is there anything you want to say?      We both cried when I called to tell her. She asked to come be with me. But I insisted she stay there, to keep on schedule for her flight.  So many treasures lost. Letters and poems she'd written. I poured through the rubble...  I mark you in the moving crowd And see again those stars a warm night lent us long ago. We loved so then. We love so now.  Thank you for writing that.  Even though I'd never seen it.  Boy, that is the last thing I'd want.  I only thought that if you're serious about this around-the-world nonsense. It might be handy to have a plane to fly in.  ...$36,000. After a generous discount from Lockheed.  ...not to mention at least another 36 to get it modified and ready.  Actually.    A university.  I've sort of persuaded Ed Elliot to create an Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research at Purdue. And suggested a budget item of...  ...oh, eighty grand. For a suitable `flying laboratory.'  Nah.  By the way. That's not the surprise.  Merry Christmas.  Can't wait to see what you got me.  Wait a minute, you're flying around the world? Don't you know a woman's place is in the home??
