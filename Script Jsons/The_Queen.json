She would certainly have taken the boys to Paris. I rather regret not doing that now.  Look, whatever else you may have thought of Diana - she was a wonderful mother. She adored those boys. And never let them forget it. Always warm.  And physical. Never afraid to show her feelings.  Yes, she MAY have encouraged all that, but still..  That was always the extraordinary thing about her. Her weaknesses and transgressions only seemed to make the public love her MORE. Yet ours only make them hate us. Why is that?  Why do they hate us so much?    Yesterday, when we drove the coffin back into London, there was a noise. A bang. I don't mind telling you I thought it was a gun.  I thought someone had taken a shot at me.  Are you sure?  Isn't it possible..that to some people...the Royal Standard is just.. ..a flag? And that the flap pole being bare sends out the wrong signal.  Yes...but sometimes...in a situation like this..one has to be flexible..    Apparently there are now fifteen.  And people are queuing through the night.   CHARLES crosses the saloon to his study, talking to his Private Secretary.   They just adored her. Would have loved nothing more than for her to be Queen. Someone compassionate. With a heart. Gifts in tragically short supply around here.  I've been thinking is the flag flying at half mast over my house at Highgrove?  Make sure we get a picture of that in the papers, would you? If my mother wants to make a mess of this, that's her business. I won't let her drag me down, too.  I've just been told. You've decided to go back to London.  I just want to say - I admire...

There is now general agreement, Ma'am, that a public funeral would be more appropriate.  At the moment, they're suggesting.. And of course these are early days..  ...basing it on Tay Bridge.  Indeed, and the Lord Chamberlain was at pains to stress the spirit of the occasion will be quite different. For example, in place of four hundred soldiers marching behind the coffin, the suggestion is that four hundred representatives from the Princess's various charities march behind the coffin.  And that instead of foreign Heads of State and Crown heads of Europe, the guests would include a sprinkling of actors of stage and screen, fashion designers and other.. ...celebrities..  o, Ma'am.

Oh, and the flowers.  The flowers that have been left outside Buckingham palace. Currently they're blocking the path through the main gate, and will make things difficult for the Changing of the Guard.  Actually, the Lord Chamberlain was wondering whether we shouldn't leave the flowers, and send the Guards through the North Gate.  Right, we'd better have a look at these papers.    Right...  Well, I'll try not to take that personally.  Yes, Ma'am. Just the letter of condolence to the widow of the Ambassador to Brazil.  Ma'am, apparently the Prime Minister is on the phone for you.  Prime Minister, I understand how `difficult' her behaviour must seem to you..how `unhelpful'..but try to see it from her perspective.. She's been brought up to believe its God's will that she is who she is.  She won't have seen anything like this since the Abdication.  And I cannot emphasise enough what affect that had on her. Unexpectedly becoming King as good as killed her father.  I'm most grateful, Prime Minister.  I'm afraid he's rather insisting.  I've done a draft of your television address.  No, Ma'am. Landing in fifteen minutes.  You think you can say it?  Prime Minister."
