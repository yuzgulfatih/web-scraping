Sue!     This isn't over. This isn't over by a long shot.  Hey, Sue! Just who I've been looking for!    Well, I guess you've heard I'm out of the prom. I bet that cocksucker Morton loses his job, though. Daddy's suing them. Hey, Billee! Billee! Come over and say hi to Sue.    I think we're going anyway, right, Billee?  Sure, why not? Hey, listen, I've got a good one. \"Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, but Carrie White eats shit.\"    Bullshit! That goddamn snerd and her batshit mother ­ saying we're all going to hell.  Hey, hey... tell me if I'm wrong, but who was that n there pitching with the rest of us?          No. Wait. You stopped, remember? So just stop again. Why didn't you walk out? Why didn't you walk out, Sue?  You didn't walk out, Sue... little Suze... little Suzy Creamcheese... because you didn't want to miss a moment of your precious prom.       Goddamnit, Billy!     No. You'll kill us, you stupid shit!  Stupid shit.    Can't you wait a minute?  You're so ignorant.  Bullshit.  No.  No!  Dumb shit!  I want you to do something.  I want you to do something for me. Something important.  It will be very important to me. It will make me feel very good if you do it.       I told you. He's at a funeral.     Do it, Billy.             81  What's it like up there? Billee? Billy!  You stupid shit.  Hurry up. Do you hear me, just hurry up.  I want to go home.  I plan to.     They will. They will. Won't even be close.  Don't worry. I called in a few favors.

It's not you.    Carrie. Carrie White.    Tommy, please...  Don't call me that.       I'm not everyone.  I was one of them.  We were hurting her ­     How would you like to be Carrie White? How would you like to be Carrie White instead of being Tommy Ross... big man, big jock, popular.   I did something wrong and I feel bad about it.     I don't know yet. Apologize.   That's not enough. That's like something my mom would do.  God, I hate you sometimes!  I want you to help me. Or are you just interested in fucking me?  Fucking me, fucking me...  Then help me!  I want you to think about Carrie White.  Think about it.  Here.  Tommy Ross.     Let it go, Chris.      You mean crash?  Chris, I've got to go.  I took the detention because I thought we ­ I ­ earned it. It was a shitty thing to have done. End of statement.    Me. Me. But I stopped.     I'll see you around, Chris.     Okay, Chris. That's enough.  And you don't?  I want to talk to you.  If I asked you to do something for me ­ something special ­ would you?  No matter how crazy it sounded?  You've got it wrong.  What do you want to know?      You mean what good would it do? Maybe it'll... bring her out of... make her a...  Maybe not.  You can make her change her mind.   It's not okay. You can't order anyone not to take someone to the prom.   We're not trying to hurt her. We're trying to help her.  We don't care how we look.    Why not?  I asked Tommy to take Carrie. I thought I owed her that much.  You have to make up your own mind.  Uh-huh. I guess the other kids think I'm stuck-up.    I guess she's having a field day with this.

I can't get over it, you look so different. You're positively glowing. What's your secret?         This contest is an insult to women!  Good luck!",
        "Fromm": "What are you going to leave for us, You people in your big cars Spewing pollution into the air?  You people with heavy feet Trampling down the wilderness? You people who peer into the back seats of our cars Hours after you come out of the back doors of your motels. Soon all we will have is each other, and that could be enough...     ...If you will let us have room enough And air enough And peace enough To love each other As you never could         I must say ­ I must confess ­ this poem displays an extraordinary talent... ...a talent extraordinary for you, Tommy Ross.    Tommy, this is slightly different from running for a touchdown... Any criticisms?     Carrie White?     `Beautiful.' `Bee-t-ti-ful!' `Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain.' Is that the beautiful you mean?  That isn't exactly a criticism, Miss White. Anyone else? Well, at least we've finally gotten Carrie White  Tommy? You said something?",
        "Tommy": "Yes, sir. I said... `shucks.'      Hey.  Hey, what's the matter?  What did I do?  Hey, everything's all right. I love you, honey. Did I...?  Who?  Praying Carrie?         Hey, honey, it was a beautiful poem. I wish I could have written it. Honey?  Don't call her that. Don't call me that. What the hell's the matter with you?  Hey, are you crying? Are you?  Jesus, Sue, what is it?  Told me what?  That thing in the shower? Hey, it was a joke, wasn't it? I mean, everyone was doing it.  You're special.  So you were teasing Carrie White ­  She's used to it. Jesus, you remember how she'd get down on her knees and say grace in the cafeteria... alone, for Christ's sake. And the way she dresses... Hey, Sue, she's asking for it.   How would I like to be Carrie White?   What's the big deal about being popular? I mean, one day I'll wake up and find myself working at my dad's car lot and out Friday nights and Saturdays at Uncle Billy's or the Cavalier drinking beer and maybe married with a bunch of kids... What's that got to do with Carrie White? Or anything?   I can understand that. Hey, back in seventh grade, there was this kid...   Like what?   Okay, you tell her you're sorry.   What are you going to do? Kiss her, for God's sake?  What the hell do you want me to do?    Cut it out!  Okay, what can I do?       Jesus.  I never thought about her. I mean, she wasn't someone you had to think about. She was always there ­ keeping to herself in that stupid dress ­ that weird mother. You know what I mean?    Hi!  Sure, what's up?    Sure. What?    Okay. I'll do it.  Carrie?  How're you doing?  I thought you had gym this period.    Umm... if you don't have a date for the Prom, would you want to go with me?  The Prom...    Carrie...  Hey, Carrie! Wait!    Sorry.     Miss Collins, I have to get to practice.   Look, this is between Sue and me. If you don't mind...     Anyway, she's already said no.   Don't overrate me.   Okay.   Well...  So this is where you live.      Right to the point, huh? Okay, about the prom.    Hey, I'm asking you because I want to.  Look, I don't do anything I don't want to.  Sure you can.  Don't you think you better answer?  You're going with me.  You're going.  No one will laugh. We'll see to it.  Not `til you say yes.  I don't know. Maybe it's because you liked my poem.  I'll pick you up at eight.              Hi.     You can still change your mind, you know.    Scared?  Hey, it won't be so bad.  Really, I mean it. They're okay, you'll see. Don't be nervous. Besides... I'd look awfully silly dancing by myself.  When did you come out of the treetops, Bomba?  Cold sweat is running down my thighs in rivers.     He's a good guy. See, didn't I tell you? Sure you don't want to dance?  `scuse me. Be right back, okay?  Hey, what's going on here?    Don't let me catch you hugging any guys.  Better not. Hey, listen, do you really have to be back so early?  Okay. I understand.  No, it's okay. Listen, the other kids are going over to Lewiston after the Prom ­  What is?  Hey, let me finish. What I was going to say, I mean if it'd be alright with you, what do you say we go to the Cavalier?  Hey, great. We'll have the place all to ourselves. Great! Then it's settled.  C'mon...  You can.  Hey...   No harm, no foul.  You danced.  It's easy.  Why what?  It's the prom.  Because I asked you. And...  Because I wanted to.  Because...  ...you liked my poem. Only I didn't write it. Someone else did.    Hey, look!          I know. Want to decline?  Hell, no. If you win, all you do is sit up there for the school song and one dance. And they put your picture in the yearbook so everyone can see we looked like idiots. Besides, it's the last year.  You're beautiful.  Whatever you like.  Let's vote for ourselves. To the devil with false modesty.  Hurt yourself?  There's still your boat. Toot, toot.     Hey, hey.  Don't know your own strength. Whew.  Hey, it's okay.  102     Maybe it's for you.     What?

Never mind the coin slot... It's broken.    What...?  Carrie, don't you know...? You don't. I'll show you.  17  Morty, until a half hour ago, I don't think she knew there was such a thing.  Well, knowing that mother of hers...  Carrie's always been their scapegoat. So they...  I will. But I understood how those girls felt. The whole thing just made me want to take the girl and shake her.  It's just her period, for God's sake.  It's Carrie White.  I think Carrie can go home.  I'm sure she can walk home. And Carrie, you're excused from gym for a week. Take study hall instead.        ...Snell...  Watson...     ...and the Wilsons.    You too, Chris. And spit out that gum.  You can choke on it for all I care. Now sit down.     Okay. I just want you all to know that you did a shitty thing yesterday. A really shitty thing.     Did any of you stop to think that Carrie White has feelings? Do any of you ever stop to think? No, I guess you've got your minds on your dates and the Prom. Chris, I imagine you can take your pick, who's the lucky guy?    Well, isn't he the lucky one.  And what about you, Sue? Who's taking you?  Right Okay. Now my idea for this little trick you pulled was three days' suspension and refusal of your prom tickets.     That would hit you where you live, now, wouldn't it? And you'd deserve it ­ I don't think any of you have any idea of just how nasty what you did was. The office has decided that you're to have one week's detention.  But. There's one little catch. It's to be my detention. Right here in the gym. Fifty minutes every day. Get the picture?     That's up to you, Chris. That's up to all of you. Punishment for skipping detention is three days' suspension and the loss of your prom tickets. Any other thoughts?  Right. Now change up.  The period's not up, Hargensen.  There are ten minutes left.  One more word from you and I'll throw you across the room. Want to see if I'm telling the truth?  Carrie? Carrie, what's the matter? Was it one of the girls? Did one of the girls do something to you? Do you want a Kleenex?  It's all right. Just tell me, there's nothing to be afraid of.  That's it...  Not until Monday. Now what is it? Are you going to tell me? Come on, Carrie, tell me.  That's great!  Tommy Ross ­ that's wonderful. He's cute.  Maybe he really meant it. I mean, maybe he really did mean it. Maybe you should think about it. It might be really fun. You might have a really good time!  C'mon, Carrie. You should have a better image of yourself. You just think you're unattractive, but look at your hair. It's really beautiful. If you just fixed it up a little... here, I'll show you.  Carrie's been asked to the prom.  Carrie White.  By Tommy Ross.  I think she put him up to it.  Who's brainstorm was this? What are you trying to do?  I hope so. I wouldn't have expected this from you, Sue. Not any of it. Well?  Why Tommy asked her to the prom. Well?  Why?  But, in God's name, what for? What could you possibly have in mind?  A part of things? Oh, come on, Sue. None of us are that stupid. And neither is Carrie.  And you're not going to go? You're going to stay home and miss your senior prom?    Just leave them on the desk. You understand, you can't come without a date?      That's too bad.   Oh, but I do. Or would you rather we continue this discussion in Mr. Morton's office?   Because it's a very big deal for Carrie White. And you know it.   Just don't try.   65  How?    Thank you You too. Beautiful.    Carrie, anything that happened before... well, it's all forgotten. I want you to know that.  I remember my own prom. I was two inches taller than the boy I went with when I was in my heels. He gave me a corsage that clashed with my gown. But it was magic. I don't know why. But I've never had a date like it, ever since. Is it like that for you?    You'll never forget it.  Have a lovely time, Carrie.  Girl secrets.  Oh, Carrie ­ let me help you.",

    "description": "It's nearing the end of the school year. High school senior Carrie White is a social outcast, largely due to being unwise to the ways of the world based on her upbringing. Her mother, Margaret White, is a religious fanatic, her extreme views primarily targeted against sex, which she believes is a sin. She even believes natural associated processes such as menstruation are a sin, about which she has refused to mention to Carrie. Mrs. White's beliefs were taken to that extreme largely because of her own failed marriage and her husband Ralph long ago having run off with another woman. The only adult authority figure who tries to help Carrie with her life is her phys ed teacher, Miss Collins, who is nonetheless warned not to get too close to go against how Mrs. White chooses to raise Carrie, Mrs. White whose beliefs are well known in the community. An impromptu event that happens among Carrie's phys ed classmates against her leads to her classmates being punished. One of those students, self absorbed Chris Hargensen, vows revenge against Carrie for that punishment, the method of the revenge associated to the phys ed class incident. Another student however, the popular Sue Snell, begins to feel sorry for Carrie. In wanting to help her get out of her shell, Sue asks her boyfriend, the equally popular Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the senior prom instead of her. This move does not sit well with Mrs. White, who in her extreme view believes Carrie will fall prey to sin. All these competing issues lead to Carrie deciding on an impulse to use a newfound skill to free herself from the figurative chains that have long been placed around her, with tragic consequences.—Huggo",
