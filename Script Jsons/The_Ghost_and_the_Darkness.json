        "Starling": "(as Patterson helps him aboard Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.   That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking.    Aren't they amazing?   Don't much like them.   Anything special about them?    I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?    Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.    We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.   Welcome to Tsavo.    (indicating Samuel, who is approaching Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.    Samuel- John Patterson.   I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done.    Finish your tour?   Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain.   You never had it.    A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?   I couldn't believe it when you said \"sort it out.\" As if it were the most normal thing in the world. \"Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway.\"    You said \"of course\" you'd need the donkey. Why \"of course\"?   I don't suppose I could watch.   I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?    Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed!     I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse. (Pulls up his trousers- his leg is knotted The pain is actually quite unbearable now.   I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-   That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent.    John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-   Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?    ...one shot...   With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-   Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.   How many shots did you need?   You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -\"there.\"    John, it will not be easy.    -please- you needn't be so graphic-    But you said they were always old.    -far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.   Not good enough- look, it's got to be tighter. Tighter.   What a good week.    We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor.  My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  I like the blood, is that strange?   Even you two must admit that it is a glorious thing, what Man can accomplish. When there is a common splendid goal, there are no limits. Think what we will accomplish when we all have God's warmth in our hearts. (Samuel's eyes have closed; he begins to snore. Patterson can't help laughing   I am immune to your disdain.  When I came here, I had but one small goal: to convert the entire continent of Africa.  Now I've decided to move on to something really difficult: I will not rest until both of you are safely in the fold.   The struggle is the glory...",
        "Abdullah": "-malaria epidemic; very sudden.    Oh, you're a doctor now, too?   On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights.    Of course you will, you are white, you can do anything... (They look at each other. They are not friends. Now-    -you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-   He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.   As are they all.   The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-   (moving in- tension rising as others crowd behind him -now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-    -at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-   You do not tell me \"careful\"- you do not tell me anything- you listen while I talk- (Now suddenly a shadow seems to cross-    You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.    I am a man of peace.   Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.    I think it's been a pleasure.   How; we don't know where they are?",
        "#2": "",
        "Samuel": "And very poor French.    The bridgebuilder- (gesturing to the working men -we have been getting ready for you.   I will bring him, Nigel.  We should realize by now that Samuel's was the voice we heard at the very beginning of the picture.   Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge.    Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.   Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them.     Railhead is across there.   Three thousand men laying track- when the bridge is done, it all joins up.  Patterson nods, says nothing, but goes to his haunches, staring at the space where the bridge is to be.   Did it look like this in your mind?    I am also liaison between these two.   One shot- one-   Patterson has made the nights safe again.     You- they cannot believe you're still here.   You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means \"slaughter\"...   We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.   Oh yes, I think so. (Starling smiles, starts to speak   I've had four wives, good luck.   For you.   (watching as Patterson opens it Good news?   Do you love her?    You give me hope, John.     I have never experienced anything like it.    Let me deliver the bibles.   The Ghost and The Darkness have come.   It's Redbeard, Abdullah- he'll kill you.   Soon.    I don't believe you had a mother. (And as Redbeard laughs too-   Oh yes. But it takes time.    Since his beard was red.   How many cattle?   They will want a lot of money.   (Samuel explains. The Masai Chief replies. Translating Why so many?    The Ghost and the Darkness have come... and we can do nothing... but if you anger them... they will stay in Tsavo... and life will become more unberable, that I know...   Whatever you wish.   Much gentler now.   He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...   Did you ever see a lion that size?   It's Hawthorne's.   And where will you sleep beautifully?    Both of them over there.  He is pointing to Patterson's area. Patterson goes to Redbeard.    -we're by the river and this is a repeat of the earlier moment when the three men brought the old man-eater into camp-  -only now eight men appear, carrying The Ghost- eight is the actual number of men that it took, and as they lower the dead animal to the ground-    Where do you go next?   Help finish the railroad.   Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.    Some mysteries should not have solutions.    Once... (HOLD on the two in the firelight. Then-     Samuel is awake now. Patterson stares at the river which is calm.    Underneath.  Somewhere.    Afraid of lions.   Here we still wonder about them. How did they escape for nine months? And kill 135 men? And stop the railroad?  And were they only lions?  If you want to decide for yourself, you must go to America. They are at the Field Museum in Chicago, and even now, after they have been dead a century, if you dare to lock eyes with them...  ...you will be afraid.  In the distance, the animals continue to move.   Sleep well.  HOLD ON THE ANIMALS. They seem to go on forever...",
        "Robert": "",
        "Beaumont": "John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree. (Surprised, uncomfortable, Patterson nods Winning personality, heaps of charm?   Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself. (again the smile - only now it's chilling One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.    We are building this railroad across Africa for the glorious purpose of saving Africa from the Africans. And, of course, to end slavery. The Germans and French are our competition. We are ahead, and we will stay ahead providing you do what I hired you to do-   -build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?   You've never built in Africa.   You'll need your confidence, I promise you.   Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.    How could it be? I hate Africa.  Now there is the sudden sound of men singing- Patterson looks around and we   Lovely sound- they seem happy.   So work must be going well?   But overall, you're pleased?   I almost feel like getting right back on.     I suppose it would be a dereliction of duty not to at least look around.  Now Abdullah wanders happily by.   I do need to see Starling.   Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?   Well, I need to speak to him.   Excellent show.  Where is Starling?   What in hell is going on?    In English.   -what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?   What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? (Patterson nods for Hawthorne to answer    How many?    Christ!  What are you doing about it?    This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?    Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.  Patterson nods. Beaumont explodes.   Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?    And it worked?   I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job.    Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it. (glancing around as Samuel appears, goes to the workers Professional hunters may be the answer.   I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.    Very well, the job's still yours, I'll go. But if I have to return, you're finished. And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair?  Told you you'd hate me.    I think another for posterity- this is an important moment in my life.  He strikes another pose- the Photographer goes to work.   Understand, I had help-   Oh surely there's enough credit for us all- let's not forget, you did the actual shooting. Of course, I hired you, I was the general who put the team together. And generals are the ones who tend to be remembered.   Clever idea, I like it.",
        "Helena": "I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.    Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?   Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-    -oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.   -not \"what if\"- there will be, there always are. Which only means that our \"son\" and I- note my confidence- will have an excuse to come visit.  THE TRAIN WHISTLE sounds.   Go, now.  Such a gentleman.    You build bridges, John-  -you've got to go where the rivers are.  They hold each other a moment more, then break, then back into each other's arms a final time, then-   Darling one- the big excitement yesterday was when some school- children spotted a whale-  -they were looking at me, John-   That was an attempt at humor but I don't feel very funny these days. I miss you terribly and after our son- I still have total confidence- well, after he's born I think travel might be broadening. As he kicks me at night I'm quite sure he's telling me he definitely wants to come to Africa.  Thought you might need reminding.   Could you tell him that his wife-  -that his family has come to see him.",
        "Patterson": "My wife is the game player in the family, sir.   I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.   But I have in India- every country presents problems.   I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.    You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.  They look at each other a moment in silence - and it's very clear they do not like each other. Patterson turns, leaves and we   (They are nutty about each other - he nods We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.   It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.  They start to walk hand in hand along the platform toward a quieter place. Patterson is suddenly very serious-   -well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-   What if there are complications?-   I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.   He just gave me his \"monster\" speech.    \"Breathtaking\" doesn't begin to do it justice. (As Starling starts to laugh, his mouth opens and sand flies in, and his coughing fit returns and    He stares out-  -and from his face it's clear something special has happened. And now, at last-   You know the most amazing thing about them?- they only sleep five minutes a day. (Starling glances at him- clearly, he didn't know that    The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.   Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.    Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life.    Beaumont says it's to end slavery.    Have you got that in writing? (Starling, amazingly good natured, laughs. And now-    Does he speak English?   Excellent. Could I see the bridge site?    Why do the workers look unhappy?   (as they pass the INDIAN tent area where prayer is starting It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.   The workers don't get on?    This is more difficult-    -but how wonderful that it's difficult, it should be difficult- what better job in all the world than build a bridge?- make things connect- bring worlds together- and get it right!     And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?    Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?   Then why do you stay?    Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. (And he walks out, leaving an astonished Starling staring after him    Starling has a tent there, too, as do Samuel and Hawthorne. And there are half a dozen ORDERLIES.  Right now, Patterson is unpacking, moving in and out of his tent. Starling, sipping tea, sits and watches.   Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.  He goes into his tent with some books now and we go with him. There is a photo of Helena on a small table. A photo of an ELDERLY COUPLE, clearly his parents. His clothes are stacked with precision. He arranges his books precisely too.  Clearly, John Patterson is a man who believes in order.   (taking a rifle, moving outside We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.    Might be exciting for you.   I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.   Shhh.    -you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.   They own the night- nobody moves when there's a man-eater out there.  Starling glumly obeys. Then-   What?   Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.    So that's what a lion looks like.     All right, I'd like to start the embankments today-  -sufficient supplies on hand?   -true enough- but without the comedy relief. (Starling, amazingly good natured, smiles, gets back up   How lucky we are.   Possibly.   All right- thee second embankment will go there. (He gestures toward the river    In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.   Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- (And he smiles, repeating Singh's gesture, both palms out   What are they looking at?   Nonsense.    Starling is there, getting ready for bed. He's wiped out, too.   I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.   That's what the books say...    You were contracted to work-   Let me see the sick.   There is no reason for fear.    Second death? Where?-    But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon. (getting control- he looks to Samuel Samuel?   Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.   You mean nobody died?   Look out, Samuel, here it comes.    Thank you, Samuel.    I expect so- it's from my wife.   I do, actually; very much.    Jesus, two of them...   (shouting over the noise of the approaching train -oh, sing a different song, Abdullah- (gesturing toward the men who stand by the train tracks -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-    You think you matter? (gesturing toward the train which is close to stopping now -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-   He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.   You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- (And he wheels around, starts to walk away as we-   Pleasant journey?   Don't they, though?    Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.    Morning, friend, glorious day.    Starling?    Yes he is.   Here he comes now.    It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-   It hasn't been that simple so far.    I'm calling it my \"contraption\"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.   In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off- (points to the open doorway -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.   I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.    In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.   What?     You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?   All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?   Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.    I do hate him. (takes the bag from Samuel, pulls out flares I want you to distribute one bag of flares to every tent area-  -tell the men to light them if there's trouble-  -make it two bags.     A lamp burns alongside him. Across the bars, the door of the railroad car is open. Flickering shadows. Above the doorway is a thick wooden slab the size of the door. n the ground, barely visible, the trip wire.   \"Dearest... ...peace and tranquility continue to abound here- the workers report each day with a smile- except for your absence, this whole adventunre is providing me nothing but pleasure...\"   Fire.  The branch is destroyed, the flowers blown away.    THE COOLIES hold rifles. They look like brothers, which they are. They also look tough. And they are that, too. THREE   Very good indeed.   All right- you'll spend your nights inside. (He indicates the railroad car. The Coolies nod You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.    Patterson stands where The Darkness was. The three Coolies are where they spent the night, on the other side of the bars.  This was the lowest point yet for Patterson. Not only had his notion come so close to working, he could never fully comprehend how the coolies missed. It never seemed possible- but of course, it really happened.   Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-   -well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-    -that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-   I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-   -careful, Abdullah-  Patterson and Abdullah and suddenly it's dangerous.    I didn't have a chance to thank you.   Got me out of trouble.   We need to talk.   Actually, no.   Somehow I guessed.     I have to ask- why do you need me?    That's very considerate.   You like him, don't you?   You've known him long?    Have you got it?   You don't enjoy killing, do you?    Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?    I can try.   It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.    The noise has kicked up and all the time it's coming closer and    -and for a moment, they might be frozen in some horrible tableau-    ...misfire... it jammed...   ...don't know...   Have you ever failed?   Goddammit!   But of course yours worked.    -but the New Hospital is on the other end, a good distance away.   You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn...    What happened to them?   Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?    Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?    -outside the fence a dreadful sound- the crunching of bones.  Patterson, Redbeard, and Samuel emerge from tents, listen. Patterson is on one side of the area, Redbeard and Samuel on the other.   Ever have to use a machan?  I did once. In India. We will tonight.    They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.   I'll be bait alone?   I'll have to.   Was that supposed to make me feel better? (Redbeard doesn't reply. Now-   You think they'll come then?  Why?   Why?   How many do you think they've killed?     -not a time for modesty, Bob-    I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.   Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came.   Samuel, with his own bottle of champagne has wandered over, joins them.   I want to meet my son- he must be what, two months old?  They look at the fire a moment. Then-   I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.    He has children?    continuing to cry out until he realized the nightmare he just had is over-  -he staggers to his tent opening, goes outside.   You're positive lions hate baboons?  Pebbles?  Let's get it over with.     He's tossing pebbles now as Samuel dozes. Paterson looks wild; only nervous energy is keeping him going now.    Samuel is awake now. Patterson stares at the river which is calm.   Where is it?     It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- (Now he shuts up fast and-   Samuel! (And he gestures for the rifle and the instant he does-    Now slowly dissolve to an African evening. Animals stretch from one horizon to the other.",
