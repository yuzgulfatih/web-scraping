        "#2": "Aye!  The pit's a fair test!     prods Ash along with a rod attached to his spiked iron collar.    The Warriors gallop off, forcing Ash and the other prisoners    to run alongside them.     making a break for it!  He's past the guards, heading for the open    drawbridge.     The iron arrow punctures the Warrior's armor, pegging him to    a wooden post.  He dies standing.     grab a discarded dinner fork.  Like men on a battering ram, they    race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks.     crouching behind a log attempting to hide.  BUT...     is burned alive.     Slay him!    The draw their swords when...     takes a leg bone upon a third skeleton's ribs. A bone xylophone.    A bone-o-phone.     leap onto the parapet and battle the men with swords.     knocks the deadite off the ledge and shouts back toward Arthur.     We can't hold this wall much    longer!     attempts to push the ladder away. A sword comes up into frame,    stabbing Arthur. He is yanked to his death with a shriek!  Evil    Ash, with his bloody sword, leaps up from the ladder and onto    the parapet. He's headed for the Book of the Dead.",
        "Pit": "a echoed wailing rises up.     looking down into the blackness we hear:     UNDERGROUND CAVERNS disappear into the blackness.     Nothing.  Just the mist rising from the water.     hoot and cheer for Ash to be devoured.     grabs Ash, and begins hammering him with her rotted fists.     shouts for Ash's death.     The Deadite's fist enters frame, slugging Ash.     rides into the castle, dismounts and pushes through the crowd    with a bundle wrapped in cloth.     is thrown against the rock wall of the pit.     shouts down at Ash.     trying to hear what the Wiseman is saying. His head jolts    backward, barely avoiding the beast's wild swing. Ash squints    to discern Wiseman John throwing something down to him: an    object falling at him through the glare above.     gasp at the ROAR of the chainsaw.  Blue exhaust billows up from    the pit.     lunges at Ash.     flies up into frame and latches onto the face of a drunken    spectator. It's fingers dig into the eyes and nose. He shrieks    and flails about, into the screaming crowd. A Warrior tears the    hand free from his face, tossing it back down into the pit.     raises the chainsaw blade and neatly bisects the falling deadite    hand.  He spins and with a roundhouse blow...     stop cheering from the Deadite. They're starting to like this    guy's guts and style.     gasp as...",

        "Wiseman": "An elderly man, in a long black cloak, steps forward.     My Lord Arthur, I believe he is    the promised one, written of in    the Necronomicon.     Picks up the chainsaw and sawed off shotgun from the dust.  He    is troubled by the strange objects. Sunlight glints off the    blade of the chainsaw, blinding the CAMERA.     rides into the castle, dismounts and pushes through the crowd    with a bundle wrapped in cloth.     shouts down at Ash.     look to Ash in reverence.      approach.  They sit in tall stone chairs across the fire from    Ash.     Only the Necronomicon has the    power.  A power which we both    require. It contains passages that    can dispel the Evil from this    place and return you to your time.     It is in a place far from here.    It can only be retrieved by the    Promised one. Other Warriors have    tried.  Their widows grieve still.    We have waited long years for you.    Out only hope is the Necronomicon.    Thou must undertake to quest for    it.  Alone must thou travel to    a distant cemetery. There thou    shalt find it.     kneels and reaches for her.     Now.  Will thou quest for the    Necronomicon?

The Necronomicon.  Quickly.     Did you bring the Necronomicon!     Just what?!     takes the book and suddenly goes pale.     No...I sensed something had gone    awry. The book's power. It's gone.     When you removed the Necronomicon    from it's cradle, did you speak    the words?     Did you speak the exact words?!     bows his head, stung by this information.     Dung eating fool!  Thou hast doomed    us. When thou misspoke the words    the Army of the Dead was awoke.     The passage is useless to us as    long as these evil dead walk. They    have a terrible desire for this    book. And they shall come here    to get it. Once in their    possession, the Evil shall rule    the Earth for one thousand    years...Because of you...we are    doomed.     We did strike a bargain. I will    return you to your own time as    promised.     Perhaps we should go from this    place while we can.     hands the flask of liquid to Ash.

        "Arthur": "the muscular commander of the group, gallops his horse into    frame, followed by FOUR HORSEMEN who are his lieutenants. Arthur    lifts his iron visor and evaluates Ash.     The Delta 88 Oldsmobile. The chainsaw, strapped to Ash's back.    The handless stump of Ash's right arm.  The Shotgun.     Brings his sword down across Ash's chest. Ash cries out in pain    as...     He bleeds.  As a man bleeds.  The    one written of in the Book would    not bleed.     and CAMERA PANS to four prisoners bound in iron shackles.     Likely, he is one of Henry's men.

The remaining    Warriors watch for sport.     above him. The sun over his shoulder.     Bring the prisoner!    The warriors surge upon Ash. His sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw    are taken from him.     To the castle!     Eye.  And fought valiantly.  But    last night fell in battle to Duke    Henry's men.     address the doomed men:     There is an Evil that has awakened    in this land.  And whilst my    people fight for their very souls    against it, you, Duke Henry the    Red, wage war on us. Your people    are no better than the foul    corruption that lies in the bowels    of that pit!  May God have mercy    on your souls.     crank a massive wench.  Chains tighten and the heavy iron lid    slides back, revealing a dark hole.  The Pit.     pulls back a iron arrow in his crossbow.  ZING!  He lets it fly.    CAMERA SWISH PANS with arrow...     Nay. Henry is my prisoners. He--     stares at Ash with hatred.     For that, I shall see you dead.     look to Ash in reverence.      grabs the laughing head and tosses it into the darkness.  The    head sails away as the laughter receded.     points to...     A moment.     watch as Ash disappears.     The Wisemen were fools to believe    that you were the Promised one.    That one such as you could have    saved us!.     and the others turn away in contempt.     spin to the sound of a woman's SCREAM.     How far from here?     Then these winged ones are only    the first of them.     takes a challenging step forward.     How will we stop an army of the    dead at out castle walls?  How will    you fight that?!  With more words?    Most of out people have already    fled.  We are but forty men.     We shall not stand in battle,    alongside the likes of him. Our    honor will not allow it.     reluctantly joins them.     watch in awe.      Load!     looks to the approaching army.     turns to Ash for the signal.     Fire!     Powder!     shouts to Ash:     Where is Henry?!     I think he will not. But know    this.  No matter how this battle    fares, I was wrong to think you    a coward.     They're coming in. What now?!     shocked at Ash's cowardly desertion, turns to his men and    shouts:     Fall back!  Man the Parapet!  Protect    the book or God save us all!     The rope ladders are hastily pulled up, leaving no access.     are stranded in the courtyard. They fight for their lives but    are quickly overcome.     attempts to push the ladder away. A sword comes up into frame,    stabbing Arthur. He is yanked to his death with a shriek!  Evil    Ash, with his bloody sword, leaps up from the ladder and onto    the parapet. He's headed for the Book of the Dead.     Form a row of archers.    They fire their flaming arrows toward the sea.",
        "Sheila": "a striking, blonde haired maiden, rushes into frame. She    searches the faces of Arthur's warriors and grows concerned.    She pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to Arthur    atop his horse.     M'Lord Arthur!  Where is my brother?    Did he not ride with you?     Her face does not immediately register the grief.  She attempts    to step forward but stumbles.  She steadies herself against the    stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the    shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash.    She flushes with anger and races up to him. She spits and kicks    at him as he's dragged along.     Foul thing!  A pox on your throat!    Thou art a Murderer!  A black    Murderer!     cries as the Village Women attempt to soothe her.     stares at him in hatred.     shouts for Ash's death.     look to Ash in reverence.      sits across the flames from Arthur and his men.  She bandages    Ash's wounds.     is dresses in a revealing tunic. She looks good.     I pray thee to forgive me.  I    believed thee one of Henry's men.    She touches Ash's hand. Ash turns away     I'm sorry m'lord. Please    understand... T'is a cruel time    for us. The Wisemen say you are    the promised one. Our only hope    against the darkness that has    descended on this land.     I think not.  I feel that there    is reason for your being here.    It is no accident.     turn to see...     She SCREAMS!     coming toward CAMERA.     rolls across the dusty stone courtyard.     knits a grey woolen garment as she watches Ash.     gasps.     moves closer.     I still believe that thou wilt    help us.     I still have faith in thee. In    my heart I know thou wilt still    succeed.     in the clutches of WINGED DEADITE #2.     M'Lord Ash!  Help me!    The beast flies off with the fair maiden, soaring over the    castle wall and into the distance.     looking up to Evil Ash in fear. His boney finger comes down into    frame and strokes her lovely cheek.  She pulls away in    revulsion.     Don't touch me!  You foul thing!     The Promised one will come for    you.     ride side by side on skeletal steeds.  Sheila lifts her black    veil, revealing bone white eyes, set into a face now the texture    of cracked leather.  She looks with admiration to...     ride their steeds to a halt atop a hill.     takes out the last of the stranded warriors with her sword.     leaps onto the moving Deathcoaster to face Ash.     Thou didst find me beautiful once.     attacks with a SHRIEK!",

        "Ash": "Why would you say that I am    insane?  I wouldn't say that I've    lost my mind simply because I've    heard the voices and seen the    godless things moving in the    woods. If anything, I think more    clearly now than ever before. I    know now that there is such a    thing as a living Evil. A dark    and shapeless thing that lives    not in the spaces we know, but    between them. In the Dark. In the    night. And it wants the exact same    thing as you and I: a chance at    warm life on this Earth. It    doesn't care that is already had    that chance ...once. Now listen    closely because there isn't much    time. Listen and believe, because    it's all true.     I first saw the damn thing at that    blasted cabin. The Necronomicon.    An ancient Sumarrian text, bound    in human flesh and inked in human    blood. It contained bizarre burial    rites, prophesies...and    instruction for demon    resurrection. It was never meant    for the world of the living.      The book awoke something dark in    the woods.     It got into my hand and it went    bad.     twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.     So I lopped it off at the wrist.     In order to rid myself of the foul    thing, I read from a passage in    the book that was supposed to open    a hole.  A hole in Time that would    send the Evil back. And it worked.     recites the incantation from the Necronomicon.     ...I just didn't plan on coming    along.     He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady    BEATING of his heart.     He shields his eyes from a sudden bright light.  The funnel    cloud electrifies.     RIPS at the fabric of Time.     looks up from the dust to behold...     stares in confusion at the strange medieval figures.     waves a shaky hand.     Take is easy now chief. I don't    know how I got here and I'm not    lookin' for any trouble.     is cut. A thin red gash.     leaps atop Gold Tooth's horse and jerks the reigns.     rears up, kicking it's hooves into the air.     gallops off as Warrior #2 runs at him. Ash kicks him in the face    as he gallops past.  The Warrior is sent reeling.     galloping over a hill.  He is almost thrown by the horse, but    manages to hang on for dear life.     Where the hell they put the    stirrups on this thing!!??     grasping at the side of the horse, hoping to find some purchase.     he rides past CAMERA, almost falling from the horse.     glances behind him.     They diverge to either side of CAMERA.     whips his horse.      ducks the blade.     ducks as the first horseman swings his blade again.     yanks back upon his horse's reigns.     ride at one another.     He inserts the stump of his right arm into the female end of    his chainsaw arm bracket.    FOOMP!  He twists his stump and the chainsaw bracket locks into    place.  CLINK!    He thrusts his chainsaw arm outward, pulling on the starter    cord; PUTT-PUTT-PUTT... The engine won't turn over.  He curses    and yanks again.     is knocked from his steed.  He tumbles to the dust, narrowly    escaping his own horse's hooves.     rolls to his feet and spins to the sound of approaching hooves!     raises his chainsaw.  CLINK!  He deflects the blow. Ash swings     the chainsaw in a roundhouse motion, clipping the Second    Horseman as he rides past.     crumples.  He looks up in pain to...     No!     bound in his iron shackles, whipped by Gold Tooth, who rides    alongside him.     shackled alongside other prisoners, is prodded inside the castle    walls.     halt. Iron keys rattle. The shackles are unlocked. Ash and the    prisoners rub their reddened wrists. They are pushed at    swordpoint towards a circular iron grate that sits atop the    ground. This is THE PIT.     looks to the jeering villagers that surround the pit, wondering    what they have in store for him.     eyes Ash curiously.  This is Duke Henry the Red.     Who wants to know?     You ain't leadin' but two things    now, pal. Jack and shit.  And Jack    left town.     stiffen in fear.     watching with disbelief.  We hear the warrior's echoed cry of    terror, then a SPLASH as he hits bottom.     is frozen in fear.     jerks from the pit to...     turns to Arthur and in a desperate, cowardly plea:     Hey, I never even saw these    assholes before..    He spins to Duke Henry the Red.    You gotta tell 'em you don't know    me. We never met. Tell him.     tumbles down into the pit.  He lands in a STEAMING pool of foul    water at the pit's bottom.  He stands and coughs out a mouthful     of the rancid water. He looks about.     UNDERGROUND CAVERNS disappear into the blackness.     spins to a small sound.     Nothing.  Just the mist rising from the water.     shifts his glance again.     doesn't notice the misty water behind him beginning to stir.    Bubbles. A hand emerges. Silently, a pair of bone white eyes    break the surface.     spins... but there's nothing there.  As he turns back around,    he is confronted by...     and backs against the steep rock wall of the pit.  He tries to    scale the steep face. He gets one foot up.     He falls away from the wall, his arms flailing.     The Deadite's fist enters frame, slugging Ash.     is knocked back into a shallow pool of steaming water.     cries out in pain.     cross to form a scissor lock around the Deadite's throat.  He    flips the beast.     is thrown against the rock wall of the pit.     trying to hear what the Wiseman is saying. His head jolts    backward, barely avoiding the beast's wild swing. Ash squints    to discern Wiseman John throwing something down to him: an    object falling at him through the glare above.     summons his strength and leaps upward.     ascending, his teeth gritted, every muscle straining, he soars    past CAMERA.     snags the chainsaw, locking in onto his wrist bracket.CLICK!     He lands on his feet, in the path of the approaching beast.     Come on, you blasted piece of--    He thrusts out his chainsaw arm, yanking the starter cord and...     is splattered with black bile.     raises the chainsaw blade and neatly bisects the falling deadite    hand.  He spins and with a roundhouse blow...     Ash decapitates the beast.     climbs the steep wall of the pit when a SECOND DEADITE emerges    from the earthen wall before him.     slams the butt end of the chainsaw into the beast, knocking it    back into the water.     comes up, over the edge of the pit.  Followed by... THUMP!  Ash's    bloody hand.  Then his bruised face.  Covered in the black blood    of the Deadites. He crawls to his feet.    Ash tuns to the crowd, his list clenched.     All right now. Who wants to be    next?  Who wants some.     You want some more?  Huh?!    Gold Tooth and the others give him a wide berth. Ash calls out    to Henry.     Now climb on those horses and get    out of here.     slaps Henry's horse.      removes his sawed off shotgun from Wiseman John's horse and    turns to Arthur, then the crowd.     This is my boomstick. It's a    twelve gauge, double barreled    Remington pump. Next one of you    primitives touch me...     pointing the barrel just past Arthur. He, but no one else, has    spotted the surviving Second Deadite crawling up from the pit    on the forgotten chain.    The crowds gasp is cut short by....BLAMMITY-BLAM!    The shotgun belches flame. The blast cuts the chain, leaving    the Deadite teetering at the pit's edge.     twirls the shotgun about western style: WHOOSH, WHOOSH,    WHOOSH...  and holsters it.     Bring me your hoo do man.     opens his mouth to allow a spoonful of food to enter.  No sooner    has he swallowed then a piece of fruit is offered.  He waves    it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from a goblet    on wine, brought to his lips by a female hand.     sits across the flames from Arthur and his men.  She bandages    Ash's wounds.     First you wanta kill me, now ya    wanna kiss me.    He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds.     Lady, just leave me alone.     They're mistaken.    She stares deeply into his eyes.     Well what is it?  Can you send me    back or not?     The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's    the thing that got me here.     Me?  Now way, no day. Only place I'm    goin' is home.    A sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire.     turn to see...     His haw drops.  He slowly stands as...     clutches Wiseman John, not allowing him to touch her.     It's a trick.  Get an axe.      watches the spectacle in horror as he sees...     does a flying leap and tackles SHEILA, knocking her out of the    stone's deadly path.     rolls across the dusty stone courtyard.     rolls into frame and glances up to see...     rolls the Possessed Woman over, and into the path of...     gasps for breath as he reaches behind him, into the flames of    the fire, his fingers groping for a weapon.     grasps a flaming log with his bare hands and rams it down the    monster's oversized throat.  She chokes.     He considers.     points to the hand piece on a hanging suit of battle armor.     tightens the tension on the shock absorber springs with a    ratchet like device.     extends his arm triggering the tightly wound spring.     SNAPS open with great force.     clenches closed with such great power, that it bends a iron    goblet.     He studies his new hand. It will do nicely.      stares over the castle wall to the foreboding wasteland with    apprehension.  The wind blows upon his hair. Sheila appears    behind him. She drapes a grey garment over Ash. A magnificent    cape. Ash draws her body close to his. He wraps the cape around    her.  Together they stare off into the night, then turn to one    another and kiss.     He wears an iron breastplate with the insignia of Arthur's army    that compliments his new spring-powered iron hand.  His chainsaw    juts from it's saddle holster on the horse's back.  Ash's cape    billows as he rides.     What's going on?     anxiously eyes the wall of swirling mist.     which nervously pounds the earth with it's hooves.     Clatto Verata Nicto.  Okay.      Clatto Verata Nicto.     I got it.  I got it.  I know your    damn words. All right?  Now you get    this straight: I get the book,    you send me back. That's the deal.    After that I'm history.    Ash rears up on his horse and gallops into the mist     He whips the horse.      He gallops past.  CAMERA PANS as he disappears into the thick    fog.     rides out of the wall of mist. He finds himself on a trail    leading into a thick forest.     rides slowly on through the darkening woods.     He hears a sound and look to...     hears a woman's soft laughter.  He glance to...     kick his steed and bolts.     frantically weaves his horse around storm felled trees which    jut from the ground.     jerks upon the reins and his steed leaps a fallen tree.  He    gracefully leaps a second tree.  But as he leaps over the third,    he is ripped off the horse by a low branch.  He falls hard to    the mud as the horse gallops off.    He groggily stands and stumbles onward.     running for...     comes upon the shed's door.  Locked.  He heaves his body against    it but it won't give.     unscrews his iron hand and holsters it.  He slings the chainsaw    from his shoulder and snaps it onto his stump bracket.  Click.    He threads the chainsaw starter cord through the V-SHAPED SLOT    that extends from his breastplate. CLICK.  He thrusts out his    arm and the chainsaw ROARS to life!     Come on!  Come on!    The chainsaw dies. He jerks out his arm to restart it. Putt.    Putt.     Blasted piece of junk!     delivers a mighty kick to the door.     presses himself against the door for all he's worth, praying    that whatever it out there, won't get in.    BANG!  Splinters fly.     begins to SCREAM.  And the BANGING halts.     as they are swept up at super speed in the grip of the Evil    Force.  Ash is seen rocketing through the long hallway of the    Shed, spinning head over heels.  Ash rips through other doors,    taking them with him. Ash is now sandwiched between two doors    as he flies through the air.     enters the Mill.     Anybody here?!    The place is quiet. Ash slumps down against a wall to catch his    breath.     This place'll do for the night.    Get the book in the morning.     peers through the window.     listens as the cabin CREAKS like an old ship beneath the force    of the gale.     Damn this cold.     looks about the Mill and spots an iron stove.     lights the fire with his Zippo lighter and huddles near the    flame for warmth.     'least I won't freeze to death.    He turns to a tiny sound.     behind him, through the window, a large gnarled hand sweeps    past.      spins, raises his shotgun and fires.     Only the night woods.  The \"gnarled hand\" comes back, sweeping    down in front of the broken window, but it's revealed to be just    a tree branch swaying in the wind.     reloads. He moves to the front door and peers out through a    crack.     through the crack in the door.     CAMERA pushes through the crack to the woods beyond.  There is    movement.     He sweeps the barrel of the shotgun toward the sound of sticks    breaking.     It rears up on it's hind legs. It's front hoofs come down toward    Ash.     leaps aside just in time.     snags the horse's reigns.     Easy, boy.    The horse calms.  Ash ties it to a tree, patting it's head. A    shadow passes behind him. He turns toward the Mill.     He sees am image of himself inside the Mill. Peering out.     stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the    Mill, halting Ash's view. Ash races for the Mill.     races through the door and toward CAMERA when...SMASH...Ash's    reflection shatters. He's run into a mirror. Shivering, he picks    himself up from the pile of broken glass. He moves to the    fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO....     Two inch high versions of himself.  They leap from the mirror    fragments and land on the floor.     is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire.     grab a discarded dinner fork.  Like men on a battering ram, they    race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks.     SCREAMS in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the    stove pipe.     lift the barrel of the shotgun in Ash's direction.  Another    leaps upon the shotgun's trigger. BOOM!     barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head    off.     SHRIEK with uncontrollable laughter.  They jump away from the    shotgun and scurry off across the floor.     pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it.     is running for his life, as fast as his tiny legs will carry    him.     stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front    of him by other tiny ASHES.  His head slams into a stove pipe.    He crumples.  He lands with his cheek pressed against the hot    stove.  SSSSSSssss.  He pries his face loose with a spatula.     and spills slippery grease about the floor.     with an upside-down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back    and forth on the grease.  He stands and tries to dislodge the    bucket.  He trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his    path.  He falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting    needles jutting from it.     SCREAMS and jerks upward, slamming his bucket head into the    stove pipe.  CLANG!  Ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks    the needles from his buttocks.  He looks about for the little    imps.     crouching behind a log attempting to hide.  BUT...     has seen him.  He \"accidentally\" elbows the log and Tiny Ash    #2 into the stove's fire.     Ooops.     is burned alive.     glances downward at the pitter patter sound of tiny feet.     is dashing across the open expanse of floor.  Ash's gigantic    foot comes down to crush the little man.  Tiny Ash #3 raises    a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot.     jerks his leg upward in pain.  Ash dances about the place    hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the greasy area    of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in    his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost    regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls,    and hits his head on the stone floor. BLACKNESS.     awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with    tiny ropes.  Directly above him, on the edge of a table...     suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs.     stand atop Ash's face.  They push from either side of his    nostrils, plugging his nose.  Ash's mouth opens as he gasps for    air.  As he inhales...     is released.     He free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form    a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat.     inhales the living beast whole.  He chokes violently.  He breaks    his bonds an he hacks for breath.  He puts his finger down his    throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no    avail.    He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but they are    gone.  He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles    to a chair.  He goes pale.     Nasty little thing's inside me.    He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain.    Well let's see how you like a    little hot water!    He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding    contents painfully down his throat.  He sets down the kettle    and waits for a moment.  A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomach     emits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his chest.  Then his    arm.  He rips back his shirt sleeve.     We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6's body squirming down    Ash's arm, just beneath the skin.     watches in horror as...     lands next to an iron vice. He reaches for the EVIL HAND.  But    the hand has grabbed a mallet that BONK-BONKS him on the head.    Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into    the opened vice.     with is head still wedged in the vice.     Why you dirty little...AHHHHHH!!     Soon as I get out of this thing     No!  Not the teeth!     struggling in the grip of the vice.     Where the hell are ya!?     I can't see ya!!     No, no--not the poke--    SSSSsssssssss!     jerks his head free from the vice with a SCREAM.  He holds up    his iron hand.  It's back to normal.  Again under his control.     Okay then.    But he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: His    shoulder itches.  He scratches it.  The Itch grows.  It itches    madly.  He rips back his shirt.  Upon his shoulder... THERE     SHRIEKS and SHRIEKS and races out of the mill.  The CAMERA    follows him in docu-horror style as he flees into the dark    woods.     staggers about in a frenzy, stumbling over logs and through the     brambles.  He races up to the CAMERA and cries out as this    protrusion upon his shoulder becomes more pronounced.     Dear God, it's growing bigger!     Staggers through the woods like a drunkard, the two identical    heads trading insults, and sharply butting against one another.     opens it's mouth and bites the nose of the Good Ash head.     retaliates by gouging the eyes of the Bad Ash head.     collapses against a tree.  Under the light of the full moon we    see a terrifying sight:     Like a human spider he scurries about the forest floor,    propelled by his four arms and four legs.  Suddenly he stands    and SHRIEKS as the EVIL ASH begins to pull away from the first.    He literally splits into two.     They square off beneath the moonlight.     circle one another like wolves.     What... are you?  Are you me?     WHAT... ARE GOO?  ARE GOO ME?!!  You    sound like a jerk!     Why are you doing this?!     Wanna know?  'cause the answers    easy. It's cause I'm the bad Ash,    and yer...     Dances a funny jig around Ash.  He SMACKS Ash across the face    as he sings:     ...Little goody two-     the shotgun barrel is suddenly shoved into his frame, pointing    at his nose.     blown backwards into a double backflip.     slams against a tree, upside-down. Then slides to the ground,    quite dead.     clutching the smoldering shotgun.     Good...Bad...I'm the Ash with the    gun.     staring down at the body of his evil self.     I know better than to bury you    whole.     falters for a moment as he stares down at the form of his Evil    twin.  He grits his teeth... and lowers the saw to the grisly    task.     with shovel in hand, drags a bloody burlap bag from the Mill.    Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the base of    an old Oak Tree in the graveyard.    Ash mumbles nervously to the bloodies burlap bag at his feet    as he digs a grave.     Now you see what's what.  Man's    body is his own personal property.    Don't anybody try to take that    away from him.     finishes digging and lifts the bloody burlap sack.  As he heaves    the bag into the grave, the Evil Ash head spills out.     It's eyes pop open!  It peers up at Ash from the grave.  It    croaks;     You'll never get that Book. I will    come back for you.     Hey, what's that you got on your    face?     Huh?     as a shovelful of dirt is heaped atop the CAMERA.     buries it deep.  He raises a crude burial marker high above his    head;     (muttering under his     breath    Rest in pieces.     backlit by the moon, brings the burial maker swiftly into the    grave. A flash of lightning reveals...     This must be it. The cemetery.     moves toward the cemetery.     In the center, lies a massive slab of black stone.     draws closer, his teeth chattering as the wind blasts at him.    He glances down to...     sitting atop the ground, leering up at CAMERA with empty eye    sockets. The wind whistles through the empty skull.  The jaw    bone drops open with a squeak.     His hair is whipped up by the wind. He looks to...     arrives at the foot of the massive stone.     steps close.     Wait.  Three books?  Nobody said    anything about that. Ha!  That    Wiseman was so busy fillin' me    fulla his secret words and phrases    and, and, his... bullshit, he    forgot to mention anything about    that.  Like do I take all of 'em    of one or 'em, or what?  Well...    He reaches for the first book and opens it.     Wind hits Ash's face as he feels the suction of the book growing    stronger.     is stretched as it's pulled down into the book.     Ash's arms stretch down into the book's black page.     stretched and screaming, is also pulled on by the book.     A taffy stretched version of Ash struggles against the pull of    the black hole. He pulls free and snaps the book shut.     His face vibrates like jello until it finally snaps back to    normal.     Woah.  Wrong book.    He turns to study...     tries to decide between them.  At first he's sure which one it    is.  Then, chiding himself for being so easily duped, chooses    the other.     Huh.    Ash reaches for it again and the book bites him!     Dear God, help me... ahhh!!!    The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!     pulls it from his face and throws it. It lands back on it's    pedestal.     faces the remaining book.  He slowly reaches for it as the wind    kicks up. Ash gently lifts it and turns it over.     bristles in fear.     Okay.   The words.  Say the words.    KLATOO!... VERATA...  uh...  Uh...    Necta... uh... Nectar...    Necktie... uh...    He hesitates, then calls out boldly.      Okay then.    But he loses his smile as... a LOW RUMBLE is heard on the    soundtrack.     A tiny figure among the gravestones which tremble and one by    one are thrust from the earth.     Hey, wait a minute. Everything's    cool!  I said the words!  I did!     falls.     reaches for it when a SECOND skeleton hand rips from the ground    and clutches his face.     No.. no more...    The skeletal fists pepper Ash's face with punches.     Leave me alone!  Leave me aHUUU!     His face has become a punching bag for the skeletal hands.  They    pull his ears and gouge his eyes.     open his mouth wide with in a SCREAM!     They bulge as he swallow the arm.     jerks backward, vomiting out the skeletal arm.  He tumbles to    the ground.      Keep you damn filthy bones outta    my mouth.    SNAP!  He breaks the boney arm in two and runs away from the sea    of limbs. A bone arm rips from the grave and reaches for the    Book of the Dead but Ash scoops it up first.  He leaps over    another set of groping arms that rip from the ground!     atop the horse. He glances back in fear to see...     is thrust from the ground. A hand breaks the surface of the    earth.     fly up from the grave and assemble themselves into a lopsided,    decayed version of EVIL ASH!     stares in horror at his evil self. All around, skeletons rip    from the earth and shriek as they come back to life!     kicks the horse and rides off.     galloping back the way he came. In the distance we see the    cemetery. More bodies arise from the ground.     Now far from the danger but still he rides hard.     I'm through bein' their garbage    boy.  I did my part of the    bargain.    He pats the saddlebag, where the book is and grins.    Now they owe me.  Like in the    deal.  I want back.    He whips his horse...     A tiny figure, rides toward the castle.     rides across the lowered bridge and into the torchlight of the    castle.     is led to the THREE WISEMEN.     pours a bucket of water over his head and begins drinking.     slurps down more of the water, averting his eyes from the    Wiseman.     Yes. It's just that...     Nothing. Here    Ash produces the Necronomicon.    Now send be back. Like in the    deal.     suddenly looks very guilty. Wiseman John turns to him.     Yeah.  basically.      Well, maybe not every single    syllable, no.  But basically I    said them.  Yes.     Hey. We had a deal. You told me,    you could clean this thing up,    once I got you the book. You said    there was a passage in there that    could get rid of this thing and    send me back.     You wanted the damn book. You got    yer book. I did my part of the    deal.     Yeah. Well good. That was the    deal.  So uh...when do you think    we can...     looks about at the condemned faces.     CAMERA PANS past the doomed faces in the crowd.     I mean...when can you send me...     sees Sheila, but looks away, consumed with the guilt that he's    doomed her.     is solemn.     No.. They're right.  I screwed    up. I didn't come through for you,    and...  I'm sorry for it.     Sheila... It's over for me. I    don't belong here and I'm going    home. I didn't have what it took.    It's over.    He bows his head and moves off.    A high pitched SHRIEK is heard!     No!     races to intercept.  He plants himself between Sheila and the    beast.     opens his steel hand, then clamps it closed again on the handle    of his sword.     swings his sword upward.     spin to the sound of a woman's SCREAM.     shakes his fist at the receding beast.     Damn you!     who stands on a high castle wall, clutching his smoldering    shotgun.     Go ahead and run.  Run home and    cry to mama.  I'm through runnin'.    I stay we stay and fight.     We'll get Henry the Red and his    men to fight with us.     Then you'll die.  Honor and all.    Now who's with me?     directs teams of skeletons to dig at the graves.     Dig!  Dig faster!  I want every black    hearted, worm infested, son of    a bitch that ever died in battle!    We'll storm their castle and take    the book!  Then my lads, eternal    life shall by ours!     looks down at her with lust.     Why ain't you a sweet little    thing?    His boney digit caresses her lips.     Your gonna learn to live me missy.      yanks her to her feet.     Darlin' I'm gonna save him the    trouble.    He clutches her squirming body in a boney embrace.     is suddenly intercepted by FOUR OF HENRY'S HORSEMEN.  They    surround him.     The Army of the Dead.     They're headed towards Arthur's    castle. We need your help. Fight    with us.     The only side I'm takin' is the    one that's gonna stop those    things.    Henry laughs.     Because after they finish with    Arthur they'll come after you.    Together, we've got a chance.    Besides, you owe me.     ride side by side on skeletal steeds.  Sheila lifts her black    veil, revealing bone white eyes, set into a face now the texture    of cracked leather.  She looks with admiration to...     He is general of the army of Deadites. He thrusts a rusted sword    into the air and shouts in a gritty voice:     Who rules?!     look under the hood of the Delta 88, parked in the Blacksmith's    shop.     frowns.     pour molten iron into a large sand mold.     walks along, inspecting a line of forty medieval warriors who    stand at attention. He halts before a warrior and stares hard    at him. The Warrior glances towards Ash.     You eyeballin' me boy?     I can't hear you!     You squeekin' like a mouse!  Are    you a mouse boy?!     Where you from, mouse?!     Only two things come from Perth:    steers and queers. Which are you?     takes charcoal from a dead fire and chips of dried cow dung.    He mixes them with sulfur.     draws back and releases the arrow. ZING!     hears them before he sees them: The sound of clicking bones.    Painful moans of tortured souls, the clanging of approaching    armor.     Fifty distant silhouettes of the Evil Dead appear on the    horizon.  Then fifty more.     ride their steeds to a halt atop a hill.     Where are they keeping my book?     Excellent. Proceed.      Arrows!     holds up a finger.  He waits.     waits one more beat.  The turns to Arthur.     Fire!     turns to the South.      gestures. Swords slice through lines which send giant sacks of    black powder catapulting.     turns to the Skeleton Captain #1 who rides alongside him.     You needn't bother.     slices off the head of Skeleton Captain #1. He turns to the    MOUNTED DEADITE next to him.     You are now my captain. I will    now allow anything to stop me from    possessing the Necronomicon. Get    me into that castle.     Arrows!     He'll be here.     looks terrified. He turns and runs from the castle entrance,    dropping his sword, and hides in the blacksmith's shop, pulling    the door closed behind him.     smiles at Sheila. He turns his attention to the guarded tower    just beyond the parapet.     The book shall be mine!    He raises his rusty sword.     is at the helm. He pulls a cord.     operates a crude instrument panel with only two levers to steer    the craft. It's a bumpy ride.     Honey...You got real ugly.     spins out his double barreled shot gun and...     pulls hard on the steering stick and it tears loose from the    craft.     tumbles from the helm and hits the ground.     picks himself up from the dust. He looks upward to...     races to a set of ropes and pulley that ascend the parapet. Two    deadites come at him. He grabs the rope with his steel hand and    slices one end of it with his sword.     looks to...     approaching the Necronomicon.     kicks aside a hay bale and removes a mini-crossbow with four    flame tipped arrows, loaded and ready. He fires.     watches in horror as...     bring their swords together with such great force that sparks    fly.  Ash is forced back against the stone pedestal that holds    the Necronomicon.     imbeds in a wooden beam.     grabs the Necronomicon, then swings his sword at Ash.     grabs a burning iron torch from its mount.     swings his sword. Ash leaps over the blade. The Skeleton swings    downward, and Ash side steps it.     rabbit punches CAMERA.     delivers a right hook, spinning the skeleton's head around in    a circle.     falls to the courtyard below, alongside the catapult. He glances    at the burning fuse.     leaps from the parapet and lands atop the catapult. The Skeleton    looks down at Ash with a nasty grin of bone.     Behold...    He gestures to the Evil Dead that overrun the parapet and now    battle the last twenty of Arthur's warriors for control of the    Keep.      You're finished.    He extends the Necronomicon to taunt Ash.     I possess the Necronomicon. I've    crushed your pathetic army. Now    I'll have my vengeance!    He raises his sword for the death blow...     turn...    A jubilant CHEER rises from the castle as...     has grabbed a sword from a fallen warrior. With a single motion    he slices the hand that holds the Necronomicon from Skeleton    Ash.     snags the book with one hand and on the backswing, slices    through the rope, springing the catapult.     are dipped into the flame of a bonfire.  They ignite.     We said goodbye to Arthur.  Sure    we had our problems.  But in the    end, he was all right.      watch the funeral pyre sail off.  It's flickering flames play    upon their faces.     Peace was made between the two    peoples.  And a new nation was    formed.  They offered my a chance    to stay among them and teach them.    A chance to lead them.  To be    King.  But Sheila was gone.    Besides, I had places to go.     Yeah.  Right...    Ash takes the flask and studies it.    ...but what other choice did I    have?     rides off.     I had to find a place to crash.    For a very long time.     with the aid of his horse, drags the Deathcoaster inside the    cave.    He sets the horse free.      Places a black powder charge at the mouth of the cave.  He    ignites the fuse and climbs into the car.     I locked the door.     uncorks the flask filled with the Wiseman's brew.     I closed my eyes.    He lets six drops fall into his mouth.  One for each century    he must sleep.     I took a drink.    Ash is unaware that an extra drop has fallen into his mouth!  A    7th drop!  Ash swallows the liquid.     I didn't know if it was day or    night. I started... to get    drowsy... And I slept...     falls into a deep slumber.     now in a different position. Time has passed. He needs a shave.     ...And dreamed.     wind faster and faster, then halt and rust in time lapse    photography. The leather band rots away and the watch falls from    Ash's wrist.     Dreams last lasted centuries.      awakens in a heap of rusted scrap, which was once the    Deathcoaster. His clothes and armor having deteriorated, he is    buck ass naked as he staggers to the mouth of the cave. He digs    at the rocks that block the cave's entrance.  Sunlight streams    into the hole he has created.     climbs from the cave and steps into the sunlight.     And when I awoke...     beholds...      ....I found that I had slept too    long.     is so small a dot now, and so far away, that we almost can't    hear his terrified SCREAM!"
