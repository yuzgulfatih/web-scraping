    "description": "First Sight is true to the title from start to finish. Virgil Adamson skating in the dark appears first to Amy Benic in her car headlights driving lost searching for her retreat spa motel. Virgil's first visual memory links him coincidentally to his last. This is a true love drama with the character of Phil Webster providing laughs counseling visual therapy. All demonstrate emotional vulnerability, teaching the audience that learning love matters in art, architecture, education, parenting, massage and trees.â€”Larry Auburn",
