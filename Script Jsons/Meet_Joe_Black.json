        "Parrish": "MOVE THROUGH French doors that lead from a wide terrace into an expansive living room, DOWN wide corridors lined with Bierstadt and Cole paintings, the Hudson River School, mists and trees and small boats and distant humans.    MOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish- ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping occupant, WILLIAM PARRISH, 64, a warm but commanding face, a man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm.  Although asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him. Parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain.  Now the severity of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm.  The wind comes up, through the wind a VOICE is heard distantly, or is it the wind itself:    The great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un- rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms, speakers, lights.  Ubiquitous is ALLISON, 35, Parrish's older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she relishing every moment.  A Painter approaches.   What do you think of all this, May?   Oh, the President's got better things to do than come to my birthday party.   Hi, Allison --   Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?   Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.   Hi, honey.   Drew's aboard?    I hate parties --   Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.   How did you know?   Does Drew tell you everything?   You like him, don't you?   I don't like to interfere.   Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.   'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.   In my sleep.   'Yes'.   Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go.  Quince comes running up now.   Good morning, Quince.   I'm doing great.  You ready?   How's that, Quince?   Not my birthday again?   Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.  Drew ushers everybody on, first Parrish, then Susan and Quince, Drew the last to climb on, shuts the door behind him As Allison hurries away from the whirling rotors.   I am.  With you.  He peers up ahead at Drew, on the telephone and gesticulat- ing intensely, right at home in the cockpit despite the CHOP of the blades and the pilot pressed up against him.   Do you love Drew?   I know it's none of my business --  Susan doesn't answer for a moment, then impulsively kisses her father on the cheek.   Do you love Drew?   Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?    Don't get carried away.   Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --   Well, I wasn't going to say that --   Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.   That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.   Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.   Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.   Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.   I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.   Aw, you're tough.   Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.  Silence.   Forgive the lecture --   You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.   I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.  She kisses him on the cheek.   He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.   What?   Did you just hear something?   No no, not you.   Nothing.  I'm sorry.  A respectful silence, the elevator continues downwards, suddenly the Voice intrudes again:   Nothing.  Parrish's eyes dart about, confirming no one has heard a thing but him.   Just talking to myself again.  You know me --  The elevator door opens.   Well, here we are --  Parrish leads the group out.   A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.   Yer damn right.  Parrish, followed by Drew, steps into a waiting limousine, Quince looks longingly after them.  Susan, blowing a kiss goodbye to her father, steps out into the street to hustle a cab.   Sounds good.   Do you think I need a haircut?   Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.   Good, good.  Glad to hear it.   I'm sorry, I don't recall --   I thought you were buying my company.   Well, that's very nice to hear.  Drew nods excitedly.    A magnificent granite building, a monument to good taste in the midtown sea of glass and aluminum.    Parrish and Drew enter, no particular fanfare but an aware- ness the 'Chief' has arrived, everyone giving Parrish the appropriate wide berth, Drew right beside him.   Me, too.   Like a marriage made in heaven?    Parrish, Drew beside him, proceeds through a high tech, but tasteful, maze, spiffy executive secretaries at burnished desks.  Neither looking right or left, somehow Parrish man- ages to acknowledge their bright smiles and deferential nods despite his swift entrance.  He passes through an open set of doors and he is into his own suite, commanded by JENNIFER, his assistant.   Hi, Jennifer.  Drew is still at Parrish's heels, but now Parrish stops at the open door, turns back to him, reminding Drew that this is as far as he goes without being invited.   As close as a deal could be.    Alone in his office, Parrish's ebullient mood immediately changes.  Leaning against the back of the couch, he stares out through floor-to-ceiling windows, surveying the Manhattan skyline: cogitates.  He takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, suddenly he flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder.  It is sharp but brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he ignores it.  Parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the pain comes again.  He reaches for his shoulder, tries to massage the pain, it does not subside.  Parrish stands, trying to shake it off, but it refuses to go away, some- thing is unmistakably wrong.  Now a SOUND which he has come to recognize, makes itself heard:   'Yes' what?   I didn't ask any question.   Who are you?  Silence.   Goddammit, what is going on?!   I don't!   What are you talking about?   What is this?  Who is this fucking guy?  He holds on tight to the corner of the desk, sweat dripping, his skin ashen.  Now he addresses the Voice again, searching for it in another direction:   Tell me who you are!   I'm sorry, I --   Where are you?  Are you there?   Please.  Talk to me --   What do you mean?!   Know what?  Know what, goddammit!  The VOICE is gone.  Parrish searches the corner, but the room has lost the quality it had when it was inhabited by the VOICE, it is now just Parrish's office.  Faint SQUEALS of traffic from the street, then a KNOCK at the door.  Parrish touches his shoulder, the pain is gone, but he is still wet with sweat, the KNOCK again.  Parrish straightens himself up, adjusts his tie, runs his fingers through his hair, blinks as he addresses the door.    Come in.  Jennifer enters.   Sure.    No.  Nothing.    A beautiful space adjacent to the dining room, it has a glass roof which offers a superb view of the Manhattan sky- line.  The hour is before dinner: gathered on one side of the room are Allison and Parrish, on the other side Drew and Quince.  COYLE, a butler, and LUISA, the housekeeper, pass hors d'oeuvres and drinks.   What, honey?    I know you do, darling.   Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.   Tell it to me again.  Suddenly, the Voice cuts in:   Is somebody waiting outside, Luisa?   Please have a look --  Luisa goes as Coyle continues serving.    Show him into the library, tell him I'll be right there.  Parrish, spinning with anxiety, tries to summon up his courage to go as Allison continues:   Uh -- I don't know.  No - uh - I don't...  Allison is about to press the point, but then drifts into disappointed silence as Parrish leaves the room.    Parrish moves deliberately down the hall, slows as he nears the doorway to the library.  The door is open.  He hesitates before he crosses the threshold, taking in as much as his eye can see, now tentatively, he enters.    A beautiful, classic room, areas of dim, warm light, club chairs, books reaching to the ceiling, a rolling library ladder, a weathered dictionary on a stand, a model boat carved of bone set into the stacks which are separated from the reading area by a seven-foot high partition of obscured glass.  Parrish, poised in the doorway, looks around, nothing in sight.   Hello?  Silence.   Anyone here?  No response.   I said is anyone here?!    Where are you?   What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --   I - I - uh --  The shape moves, makes itself more visible.  Although still diffused by the glass, the shape has definition, a person, a man, his features are not yet distinguishable, but he is there all right.   What the hell is this?  Who are you?   About what?   'Take me'...?  Where?   'The one' to do what?    Get what?   What the hell are you talking about?   I'm sorry --   Yes what?   What question?   The 'question' --   ...Am I going to die?  The figure who is the Voice takes a step forward now, no longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light, re- vealing himself to be the Young Man seen previously in the coffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, off- center, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful.   Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?   You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?  The Young Man steps closer to Parrish, his face is inches from a shaking, sweating Parrish's face, the Young Man daring Parrish to identify him:   You are --?   ...Death.  Parrish is shocked, stunned, terrified at the word, by what he has comprehended.  He surveys the Young Man who, at this moment, actually seems bewildered by his effect.   You're Death?   Death!   You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.   You want me to be your guide --?   I do?  How long will you be staying?   And then --?  The Young Man nods, gently.   It's... it's... over.  A long silence.  Parrish and the Young Man take each other in, the sense that now they understand each other.  A SOUND at the door.   This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.   Excuse me?  Could I say something?    It just occurred to me --    When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.   Uh -- sorry -- to have stepped away for so long -- uh -- this is a friend of mine I asked to drop by -- we got to talking and stuff -- uh -- he's going to join us for dinner -- um --  Parrish drifts into another awkward pause.   Oh, I'm sorry.  This is my daughter, Allison, and her husband, Quince, Drew, my number one, works with me...  Parrish drifts off as the Young Man awkwardly shakes hands with each person.   A name?   Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --   Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --   I'm sorry.  This is - uh - uh...  The group waits patiently.   Joe!   Yes.    What do you mean?   -- Black.   He is!  Let's sit down --  Luisa has set a plate in front of Joe, and Parrish's, which was taken to the kitchen to be warmed, has been returned. Joe looks over at the other guests, then picks up his uten- sils gingerly, strives to copy the others, stops, staring at his foot.    Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --  Drew is studying Joe.   Uh -- he's from out of town --   No --    You know each other?   What?!   Uh - will that hold you, Joe?    We've got some things to discuss.  Parrish stands, motions for Joe to rise.   Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.  Joe rises, follows Parrish to the door, stops:   Joe, that's the kitchen.    Parrish leads the way, Joe beside him as they progress through the huge house.   ...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.   Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --   So there's nothing between you and Susan?   I wish you had said something to me about staying here --   No, I'm okay with this - uh - I think.  So --  He opens a door.      Bathroom...tub...towels, sauna --  Parrish turns back to the bedroom.   ...Chair, lamp, bed --  Parrish is in a stunned state, chatters on unconsciously:   Box springs, they're assembled in Jakarta.  Had to stay in a station manager's house there unexpectedly - best night's sleep I ever had. Ordered twenty, they filled a con- tainer and shipped them right over, I've put one in every bedroom here and in the country.  Joe tests the springs.   Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?   If there is anything else, don't hesitate --   How long have I got?   When you go, I go.   ...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.   No --   Closer than that.  Parrish keeps still, trying to cool the heat of Joe's temper.   Well, thank you for letting me know.   And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.    Parrish, unsteady, starts back down the hall, Luisa appears.   No. Thanks, Luisa.   Luisa --  She stops.   Mr. Black's luggage was misplaced by the airlines.  Would you mind get- ting a few things together for him? A couple of suits, some shirts, ties, underwear, shoes.  Have Coyle take his measurements off what he is wearing tonight.    Joe has been examining his room, full of curiosity and wonderment at the oddest things, the handle on a casement window, the hem and weight of the fabric of a drape, hinges on the bedroom door.  In the process he opens this door, steps out into the hallway.    Joe wanders down the hallway past the occasional Dufy or Miro, a Venetian tapestry cheek-by-jowl with a miniature Ming vae, and even a Bonsai garden with a trickling vein of water.    In the \"back\" of the house now, utilitarian paint and decor, the SOUND of laughter and a glare of light.  Joe enters.    The staff is at ease, some smoking, remains of food around. Coyle, the butler, has his back to Joe and does not see him for a moment.  In front of Coyle, an open jar of peanut but- ter which he is spreading in generous hunks of Wonder Bread. Joe is fascinated by the process.  Coyle suddenly hears the silence, looks up and see Joe, standing up embarrassedly.    A spectacular indoor Olympic pool, window commanding views of the skyline.  Susan is swimming laps, looking very professional in a black Speedo suit, Joe wanders in, still licking his peanut butter. He observes her, but she is unaware of him, however now, as she makes a barrel turn, his shadow falls over a reflection from a window, she aborts her lap, looks up to see who it is.    Parrish, dressed for the day, passes servants busy with their morning tasks, polishing doorknobs, putting away linen, dusting picture frames.  He nods and greets them as he strides down the hall, brisk \"Good morning\"'s to Coyle and Luisa.    Parrish knocks, waits a courteous moment, opens the door, finds Joe in an elegant shirt and trousers trying to tie his tie.   Good morning.   How are you?  How're you feeling?   Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?   What about my family?  This 'adven- ture' involved only me, right?  Silence as Joe considers the point, Parrish quickly crosses to him, undoes the tie, and now begins tying it for him.   Tell you what, you promised that it's going to be only me and --   And I won't tell anyone who you are.   It is a deal?   You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.  A moment.   Yes?   Shake hands.  Joe immediately extends his hand toward Parrish, but Parrish freezes on seeing the hand, stares at it, now takes it.  Joe pumps Parrish's hand vigorously, then breaks into a broad smile.   You know, I got to thinking last night -- with you here, and seem- ingly occupied, how's your work going - uh - elsewhere?  A flicker from Joe.  He has heard what Parrish has said, his eyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the Avenue, but he is concentrating on Parrish's words.   What do you mean?   I guess so.   Of course.   Joe --?   How about giving a guy a break?   There's one to every rule.   -- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --   I'm not everybody.   I want to live.   What's it like?   What's it like where I'm going?   Yes.    As Parrish and Joe enter, Parrish is hailed by JAIME, the Elevator Starter.   Good morning, Jaime.    I'm sorry, not today, Jaime.  Parrish and Joe arrive at the bank of elevators.  Jaime, back at his post, hits a button.    You know, everyday I've walked into this building, Jaime gives me a horse.  I wonder if any of them won.  The elevator materializes, Parrish and Joe step on.    Parrish and Joe emerge from the executive elevator, Jennifer is waiting as usual with her pad, \"Good morning\"s, etc.  As Parrish strides down the hall, Joe right beside him, he passes instructions back to Jennifer who, scribbling, hurries along behind them.   -- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.    Jennifer.    Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?   What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.    Parrish enters, Joe following right behind him.  A euphony of \"Good morning\"'s from the various members of the Board, including Quince.  Everyone sits when Parrish does but Joe, right at home, spots a tray of refreshments: coffee, pas- tries, he heads for them.    -- This is Joe Black, a personal associate of mine - uh - he'll be joining us today.  I know it's -- uh -- unusual, and my apologies -- and Drew -- uh -- carry on.  Immediately indications of surprise on Board members' faces at Parrish bringing in an 'observer', Drew's reaction guarded but intense.   (quietly, indicating a  chair Would you like to sit down, Joe?    Thank you, Drew.  Parrish takes a moment, draws himself up to say something official then stops himself, what follows is spontaneous, reflective, deeply felt.   Umm -- I did enjoy -- or rather I was interested in meeting John yes- terday -- impressive... I suppose... But it did get me to thinking.  I started in this business because this is what I wanted to do.  I knew I wasn't going to write the Great American Novel, but I also knew there was more to life than buying something for a dollar and selling it for two.  I wanted to give the news to the world, and I wanted to give it unvarnished.  The more we all know about each other, the greater the chance we will survive. Sure, I want to make a profit, you can't exist without one but John Bontecou is all profit.  If we give him license to absorb Parrish Communications, and he has his eye on a few others after us, we'll be appointing him to the position he craves -- Gatekeeper.  In order to reach the world you will have to go through John Bontecou.  And not only will you have to pay him to do this, far more expensive, you'll have to agree with him.  Reporting the news is a privilege and a responsibility and it is not exploitable.  Parrish Communications has earned this priv- ilege, John Bontecou wants to buy it.  As your chairman, I urge you to agree this company is not for sale.  A silence, everybody shifts, the Board is in shock, Drew is trying to maintain his balance.    Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.   I am now.   Shall we adjourn?   Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?  Joe rises.    Parrish enters, Joe right on his heels.  They booth stop, Parrish regards him.   -- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?   ...I'd like to be alone for a while.   Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?   Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.    Now I'd like to be alone.   Here -- this will hold you for a while.  Joe stares at the money as Parrish shows him the door.   You know about money, don't you?   Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.    Jennifer shows Joe in, Parrish is deep in thought, beside him a meal laid out beautifully on his desk with linen and silver, but untouched.  Joe is more abstracted than usual, he is starting at Parrish's food.   It's all yours.  Joe starts eating, Parrish watches him, somewhat fascinated, Joe's chewing has improved.   Good?   Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.  Joe takes another big bite.   Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --   Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.  Silence, Parrish getting lost in his memories.   -- Everything reminds me of her -- there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about her -- One day she was here.  The next day she was gone.  What are you going to do? -- I guess you've heard all this a trillion times before.   Why didn't you stop me?   I thought you'd heard a trillion times --   She had on this little blue suit -- with a little white collar that had little red piping on it --  Joe is riveted on Parrish ow, Parrish aware of him, has paused.   You could have put her under glass and I would have just stood and looked at her.  But when she spoke -- I loved the sound of her voice and her laugh --  -- I couldn't get enough of her -- and gradually -- or maybe it wasn't gradually -- I realized I couldn't live without her.  A KNOCK, the door opens and Drew enters, looks at Parrish, then at Joe, stands poised in the doorway.   No.   Sit down, Drew.   Joe and I have no secrets from each other.   Why?   Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.   Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.  A moment.   Dinner?  Absolutely.   I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?   And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.    The skyline glitters through the terrace windows.  The hour is before dinner, Coyle and Luisa weave seamlessly among the family, offering hors d'oeuvres and drinks on a tray.  Allison and Susan together by a piano; Parrish, Quince and a distracted Joe are gathered near the terrace.  Joe's eyes are on Susan across the room.  Her eyes flicker towards him, aware of his gaze.   Thank you, Quince.   Next week?   No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.   Who?   Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.   Of course.   I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.   I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.   You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.   Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him.  Drew glances over at Joe.    Everyone eating silently but looks are exchanged, glances averted, Allison notices Susan and Joe looking at each other, Drew observes Parrish watching Joe, Quince, on the other hand, just eats.  Breaking the silence, Parrish chinks his glass, stands.   -- I - uh - want to thank you all for coming - uh - my family --  Everyone at the table is all attention.   -- Allison and Quince, Susan -- and the other members --  He glances at Joe, stops.   -- I'm so happy when we can get together -- I mean I know you all have busy lives --   Anyway -- I remember when you were little girls --  An awkward pause.  Quince chooses to fill the silence.   And now you're all grown up -- and I'm - uh - um --  Parrish struggles to keep his emotions in check, Drew clocking his behavior very carefully.   I had some words all prepared but now I've forgotten them - uh - um - wait a minute.  Silence, everyone waiting for Parrish to proceed.   Uh, it's gone...um -- it was on the tip of my tongue.   Will it?...  Parrish looking around, searching for words he will not find.   Anyway, I'd like to go on but...  He hesitates, drifts into silence.   There is so much I would like to say -- but I can't --  So I better sit down.  Carry on, everybody.  He sits, then immediately stands up again.   One other thing -- why don't we all have dinner again tomorrow night?    No.  The word lands with effect, Susan and Allison have heard it well.    Please, Drew.    After dinner, the family and guests file back in from the dining room, Drew alongside Parrish.   Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.   Why did you go to the hospital?   You were just curious?   About Susan?   What way would you put it?   How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.   That was wonderful.   Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?   What is the nature of your interest in Joe?   I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --   I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --   Nothing.   Then what is it?    Parrish, Joe, Susan, Allison and Quince are seated at the table, dessert plates in front of them, coffee cups beside. Allison and Susan's eyes are on Parrish, looking for some clue as to why has he gathered the family together yet again.  Parrish is somewhat within himself, but he peeks over his demi-tasse cup at Joe, Parrish aware of Joe's heightened interest in Susan, and Susan's reciprocation.  Coyle enters carrying two imposing stemmed silver trays with cakes on them, Luisa follows with one other.  They set them down in front of Parrish.   What is this?   Who's Annie?   I don't like cake.   Oh, the goddam party --   No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?   Yeah, I give a shit.   This one.    After dinner, Parrish, Allison and Susan are gathered to- gether.  At the bar on the other side of the room, Joe watches as Quince pours himself a stiff hooker of brandy.   What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.   What are their feelings?   Over my dead body.  Parrish's burgeoning anger has now gotten the attention of Joe, Susan, Quince and Allison.   I don't care.   Whose?   I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.   I think it's time you went home, Drew.    Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?   Okay.  Goodnight.    Parrish, followed by Joe, emerges from his private elevator, is greeted as usual:   Good morning, Jennifer.   What?    Parrish and Joe enter, the entire Board is assembled, includ- ing Drew, Quince and Sloane.   Good morning.  An odd mixture of responses, the Board sheepish and at the same time looking their most dutiful at this odd meeting, its sudden convening clearly a problem for Parrish, a prob- lem which he does not attempt to hide, only control.   I don't think so.  Do you?  Drew gets the message, at the same time Joe is checking out all the attendees, his eyes come to rest on Drew.   That's it?   The answer is no, quick enough for you?   I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.   Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?   Are you running this Board or am I?  Sloane leans in.   Doesn't need to.  Today, tomorrow, a week from now -- 'a week from now', who can think about a week from now -- the answer is going to be the same -- a loud, unmistakable, all-inclusive, airtight -- 'No'.  A BUZZ amongst the Board, they finally rustle into silence under Parrish's withering glance.   That's it?  I've got a busy day and this meeting has already set me behind.  Shall we adjourn?   I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.   In English, please.   Thank you for allowing me to save face, Drew.  Joe's eyes are riveted on Drew.   Joe?  Silence, then Joe rises.   Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings\" shit.   Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.    The Board meeting has broken up, clusters of members have lingered, exchanging post-mortems.  And enraged Quince has cornered Drew, out of earshot of the others.    Parrish enters, Joe right behind him, Coyle takes their coats, disappears.  Parrish hesitates for a moment, shrugs as if he has a thought he doesn't want to share, then heads upstairs with Joe.  He is trudging a bit, Joe senses his mood.   That's okay.   Just a manner of speaking.  Joe seems puzzled.    What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?   Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.  A moment.   Are you hungry?  Coyle will have Luisa fix you something to eat.   Then I can't help you.  Parrish turns into his bedroom, closing the door gently behind him.  Joe continues down the hall, enters the guest wing.    Midday sunlight streams into the sitting room, Joe passes through to his bedroom, sits tentatively on the bed, feels the edge of the silk spread, touches the pillow, then rises again, crosses back to the sitting room.  Susan appears in the doorway, Joe suddenly senses her, turns around.    Joe and Susan are at the front door, he has helped her on with her coat, she turns around, they kiss.  The kiss lingers, Susan breaks away, reaches for the door, looks back longingly at Joe and then she is gone, Joe closing the door softly after her.  He turns back into the foyer, looks up, Parrish is on the balcony, it is clear he has observed Joe and Susan.   I couldn't sleep.   No, I'll come down  Joe waits guardedly at the bottom of the stairs as Parrish descends.   What's going on?  Joe senses Parrish's tone, doesn't answer.   I saw you kiss Susan.   Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.   I'm her father!   Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.   Yes, and stop repeating everything I sai, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --   What do you want?  Joe doesn't answer, riveted now on Parrish.   Everybody wants something, Joe. You've been taking me from pillar to post here.  I thought I knew who you were, and it wasn't a whole lot of fun, however it was almost bear- able.  Now I'm getting something else from you, something very, very strange -- what is it that you want, Joe?   You're violating the laws of the universe.   Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.   And I don't give a shit.   Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.    Parrish is playing solitaire.  The SOUND of the front door closing, HEELS crossing the foyer, he looks up, at the foyer door is Susan.   Hello, honey.  He starts to get up, she motions to him to stay, looks around now.   Joe?  A silence.   Joe's not around.   I don't know.  Susan seems distracted.   Why are you looking for Joe?   I don't understand.   This is crazy --   You don't know anything about Joe --   Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.   I don't know, I can't say --   In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.  Susan doesn't answer for a moment.   I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!  A moment.    Parrish is sitting in a wing chair staring at the fire.  Joe appears in the doorway, Parrish doesn't notice him.  Joe waits, finally Parrish looks up.  They regard each other. Silence.   Yes?   What are you saying, that it's time to go?  Joe doesn't respond, Parrish and Joe measure each other for the moment.   I'm ready.   Yeah.    The Parrish AStar sets down in its roped-off landing area. The Butler runs towards it to open the door, Parrish and Joe disembark.  Following the Butler, they make their way through the maelstrom: tents being raised, platforms for music groups, portable pools with clusters of florists leaning over the edge to arrange lily pads within.  Parrish and Joe move solemnly, observing the activity, not speaking to one another.  Although they are shoulder-to-shoulder, there is a distance between them.  They walk on past chan- deliers in the garden and fake trees with lights woven through their branches.  Adding to the confusion, the AStar lifts off, the chandeliers rocking and floral pools rippling from the blast of the rotors.  May, the housekeeper, appears.   Excuse me.  Joe, not knowing whether to be affronted or not, hesitates, and Parrish strides away.  Joe does not follow.    A low-slung but well-appointed room with a writing table, a working fireplace, expensive and appropriate Hudson Valley prints.  Parrish enters, clicks on the SPEAKERPHONE, observes the party activity through a wide, bow window.   Eddie?   Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?   Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --   If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.   Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.  Parrish clicks off the SPEAKERPHONE, turns around and looks out the window again, the party preparations in full swing, colored lights are tested, they flicker on and off.   It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?   Do they, m'dear?   You are amazing.  Why, oh why, Allison, are you doing all this?  But before she can answer, a workman is tugging at Allison's sleeve, she turns away from Parrish to give him instructions out of Parrish's earshot, and then turns back, they step away now, daughter and father, alone.   Yeah?  And what about my enemies?   I haven't been the father to you that --   I wasn't going to say --   Hey, there's lots to come. (gesturing to me  activity A little excess -- like you love.  The preparations are building to a climax, all the elaborate plans coming to fruition.   You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.    Quince is \"on the carpet\", sweating through a confession, Parrish moroses but  philosophical at his desk.   It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.  A KNOCK on the door, it opens, Joe appears.   Sure.  As Joe enters, Quince flashes a warm smile at him.   Yes, I believe I do.  Quince now drifts off.   No, I'm out of business, right, Quince?  However I do have some unfinished business -- with Drew. Get him out here.  Get him on the chopper and get him out here to- night.  I want to tell this guy how I feel about him face-to-face.    All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.   Quince, I've got confidence in you.   Thanks.   What the hell do you care?   You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.  Another moment.   Say again?   You're what?   You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?  Joe doesn't answer for a moment.   I thought we had a deal.   Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.   How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --   Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.   Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.   Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.   Well, they're mine now.  Joe is silent for a moment, cogitating.   With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?   Does she know where she's going?  Joe doesn't answer.   Susan went, in whatever way she did, for that poor sonofabitch whose body you took, and everything else since has been aftermath.  You say you love her but you don't know what love is. She 'loves' you but she doesn't know who you are.  You make a deal, you're breaking it -- the bottom line is, Joe, you're conducting a Great Romance under false pretenses.   I don't expect you to.   I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.  Parrish is beginning to reach Joe.   Why did you come in here and tell me, Joe?  You are the Biggest Shot of all, you don't have to ask my permission, but that's what you're doing.  You know why?  Because you've somewhere, somehow, developed into a good guy, and you know this is all wrong... I don't know what you're going to do -- how can this be love? She doesn't know who you are.  Why don't you tell her?  Try it out on her?  See what happens.  Reveal everything there is to know about yourself and let the chips fall where they may.  Joe has received what Parrish has said.   Okay? -- I've given it my best shot. I wish I could tell you to sleep on it but...  Parrish lets his words drift into silence, he shrugs, Joe regards him.    Parrish is seated by the window, lights from the party flashing past, the MUSIC and laughter audible but muted, the fever of the celebration lost on him, within himself.  Joe enters, Parrish looks up.   Thank you.  Joe nods an acknowledgement, but his face reflects his pain. Parrish regards him sympathetically.  The silence is broken by a KNOCK on the door.  Parrish, out of politeness to Joe, does not respond.   Come in.  Quince appears, flushed with excitement.    How are we on time?  Joe shrugs, nods gently.    Get him in here.  Quince exits, Parrish presses the button for the speaker- phone.   ...May? -- I know you're busy,  but I want you to put in a call to Eddie Sloane for me --   No, he's at the office.    Parrish is at his desk, Joe in a distant corner of the room.   I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.   Shut up and sit down.  Drew takes a seat.   You're a worthless sack of shit, you fucked me over, played footsie with John Bontecou, sold my company out to line your own pockets.   The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.   Joe, don't do this --   It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --   I told you to shut up.   He is --   -- An IRS man.  Drew is stunned, Joe glances at Parrish, hesitates.   Yes, he is.  He's an -- IRS man. Aren't you, Joe?  Joe is at a loss, Parrish's eyes are glued to his, Joe gets the hint.   The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.   Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --   An offense --   No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.  Drew is all attention.   Confess to the Board every details of your participation and then submit your resignation.   You get not to go to jail.   Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.   Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.    I thought I was going to sneak away tonight...  YELLS of \"No!\"  \"Never!\"   ...What a glorious night, every face I see is a memory.  It may not be a perfectly perfect memory -- sometimes we had our ups and downs -- but we're all together, and you're mine for a night.  -- And I'm going to break precedent, and tell you my one-candle wish -- that you would have a life as lucky as mine, where you can wake up one morning and say \"I don't want anything more.\"  Sixty-five years - don't they go by in a blink?  Parrish hesitates, waves and steps away, APPLAUSE that grows into CHEERS, the music resumes, another dance tune.  Quince grabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back.  Now Parrish spots Allison, he wraps her in a tight embrace, they hold each other close for a moment, but then are separated by a surge of guests.  Parrish sees Susan, she smiles but there is a tinge of sadness about her.  He heads towards her, they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd.   I'm having a helluva time.  A moment.    I'm sorry.  Susan is examining Parrish very closely.   Yes, but --  Parrish hesitates.   I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.   No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.  Susan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer.   And I want you to feel that way, too.   That's why it's okay.  They drift into silence.   No regrets?  After a moment.   It's a good feeling, isn't it?  Silence again.   I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?   If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.   What was that?   You go ahead, honey, I'm going to catch my breath.  Suddenly he hugs her, holds her very close.  She looks at him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she smiles back.  Now she heads out with the crowd for the fireworks.  When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns and heads up towards Joe.  Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches.   Thank you.  They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks. Joe's gaze lingers.   Did you say goodbye?   I guess you have your reasons.   Now that we have a moment, would you mind if I expressed my gratitude for what you did for Susan?  Joe waits.   I never heard her speak of any man as she spoke of you -- It was always what I wanted for her -- but what happens to her now?   Don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll ruin my autopsy.  Joe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the crowd below, searching.   It's hard to let go, isn't it?   That's life.  What can I tell you?  A silence, an understanding there is another more to say. Joe looks inquiringly at Parrish as if to say \"Shall we?\", Parrish nods and Joe turns with him.  They set off now away from the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking the river.   I'm getting a little dizzy, I can feel my heart pumping --  But Parrish doesn't wait for a response, just continues on up the meadow, towards the rise of the hill, Joe in step with him.   Should I be afraid?  Joe stops, Parrish stops with him.",

        "Allison": "Paint is rust and moss green. Medieval colors -- Daddy's like an old knight.  A Florist stops her.   What about it?   Freesia, freesia, everywhere.  Daddy loves freesia -- and you, over there, lights.  Not too bright.  I'm looking for a saffron glow -- sort of tea- dance twenties.   Daddy!   Have you got a minute?   Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...   But it's your birthday.  Parrish smiles complaisantly, they continue on into a break- fast room where SUSAN, 30, Parrish's younger daughter, is grazing at a table laden with cereals and fruits and coffee.    I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.   You've got patients waiting, I've got three hysterical chefs, one loves truffles, the other hates truffles, the third one doesn't know what truffles are.  I'd better drive down.  Parrish gazes at the going-on outside which are increasing in intensity.   Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.   No.  Allison goes, Susan observes Parrish fidgeting.   Quince!  Everybody's waiting!  Quince downs this glass too, runs for the helicopter as DREW, 34, a young man going places, emerges from it, approaches Parrish and Susan.    Honey, please.   Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --   ...Music, I know how you love music, Daddy, and I want to have music that pleases you -- and of course doesn't put a thousand other people to sleep -- I've agonized over this and finally settled on Sidney Brown, twenty-four men, very eclectic, plus I'm feathering in a Latin sextet on their breaks - Tito Puente, Trini Lopez-zy, I forget their names --  Parrish has tuned Allison out, he tried to stay with it, but his mind has wandered, the event of the day too much with him.   You haven't heard a word, have you? I keep talking and all you do is nod like Mr. Himmelfass in The Nutcracker.  Parrish still doesn't answer.   You don't care, do you?   I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --   And you could care less --   Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?  A stab of pain, Parrish discreetly grabs his upper arm but manages to keep his attention on Allison.    Never mind.  Leave it to me.  Parrish ignores her, his attention has been taken by the Voice.  His eyelids flutter, nonplused, edgy and fearful.   (to Quince and Drew,  across the room Chow-time, you guys.  Parrish is confounded.  Blindly and disconcerted, he follows Allison and Drew and Quince.    Did you speak to the Governor?   His wife?    What about the Mayor?   Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.   I've arranged for favors -- silver charm bracelets for the women, platinum keychains for the men -- all engraved 'W.P.' -- but now I'm thinking of scrubbing them, they seem so ordinary.  Finally Parrish rises from the table, starts out.   Are they ordinary?  Do they seem that way to you, Daddy?   ...Well, here's another possibility. It's a little last minute, but how does this strike you?  Kaleidoscopes. Little gold kaleidoscopes.  Some German firm went kerplunkt, Tiffany's picked these things up, they're perfect party favors, however they're not personal, they're winter scene or something, snow-flakes and dachshunds...  Parrish and the Young Man appear at the table, an awkward pause ensues, the unannounced guest's presence at a family dinner being noted, and the guest himself carefully survey- ed.  Finally, Allison breaks the ice:    Hi there --    Hello, how nice to meet you.  And wouldn't it be nicer if my father would introduce you?    Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?   Daddy!  Come on, a name.   Joe...  Parrish once more drifts into silence.  (The YOUNG MAN is now identified as \"JOE\".   Love that name.   Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.    Paillarde of veal.   Honey --!   You ate?   And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --  Joe has heard Susan's question but, as he studies her, doesn't answer.   Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---   He's cute.    ...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?   ...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...  Drew enters.  He nuzzles Susan's neck, out of the corner of her eye she sees Joe still observing them.   ...When Daddy walked in with him, he couldn't even remember his name.  Now he's his house guest.  And you know how he hates house guests.  What is going on?  Drew, whose eyes have also been on Joe across the room, turns back.   -- But he does seem very nice.    Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?   From the Korean War.   Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --    You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.    That's okay, Daddy.   Dinner's ready, everybody!  A BUZZ as Coyle opens the doors to the dining room and the family files in, Drew lingering behind with Joe.    Yeah, speak for yourself.    Daddy, you could sit down if you wanted to.  A moment.   Dinner?  Again?   With bells on.  The guests try to return to their food, Susan is the most concerned about Parrish's lapse, she does not say anything but Drew next to her senses her empathy and, in something of a display, gives her a pro forma hug.  Joe has observed every instant of Drew's performance, his anxiety is palpable when Coyle leans over to serve him, offering a tray of a roast that has been carved.   Did he?  That's more than we get to do.   Annie made them.   From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.   It's for the party, Dad --   'Goddam party'!  Allison bursts into tears.    Did you hear that?  Quince quickly slashes a piece, takes a huge bite.   I knew you were going to say that. Tito Puente.  The old platoon.  Now the cake.  You just don't care.  Why did I do this?  I should have my head examined.  I'm trying to throw the party for the century for my father - and you know what -- he doesn't give a shit.  She bursts into tears all over again.   Yeah, but --   What will I tell Annie?  Parrish forks a bit of a cake.   Hi, Daddy, what do you think?   The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.   -- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.  Parrish shakes his head.   I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.   They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?  Unexpectedly, Allison brushes a lock away from Parrish's forehead, with a flick she has rearranged his hair, he blinks, a little embarrassed, but having liked it.   Above all, you've been a wonderful father.   That you've been to Susan?   But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, \"What does she want now?\"  A weather-beaten military parade ground pennant passes, 24th Infantry Regiment  \"C\"  Company.   I already feel I've had everything I could have wanted for my birthday --    Yes, it is.  Allison wades into the maelstrom now, Parrish watches her go, swarms of purveyors and caterers following her.   There you are!  Allison appears.   What's going on here?  Tete-a-tetes on my big night?  C'mon honey, you're needed.  Can it wait?  But before he can answer --   Glad to hear it!  Let's go.  She takes Susan's arm and marches her off, Joe, in thrall, watches them go as the MUSIC erupts behind them, as 'up' dance tune, a lilting, catchy melody envelops them all.  The curtain has risen on William Parrish's 65th birthday party.   Daddy!  We've been looking all over for you - this is your party - what are you doing in here?  Never mind. You're on.  Let's go.  She pulls him out of his chair, hustles him out of the room, Joe right behind them.",

        "Susan": "Good morning, Dad.    Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.   He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --  But Parrish only pours coffee.    You coming?   Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --   Drew told me.   I hope so.   Yeah.  I guess so.  A moment.   ...Then don't.  The helicopter CHOPS in overhead.   -- Here comes our boy now -- Shall we?   Hi.  Drew kisses her, over her shoulder he glances at Parrish.   You're only six-five once.   I thought you were in a meeting--?   ...There's a start for a meeting.   No, it's none of your business.  Another moment.   You mean like you loved Mom?   Probably.  A moment.   Uh oh --   And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.   What were you going to say?   So what's wrong with that?   You're not listening --   Don't get dirty, Dad --   That's all?   'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --  He smiles.   Bravo.   I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.   I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.   You're terrible.   Thank God.   Daddy, what's the matter?   What is it, Daddy --?    Are you okay?   Well, go get 'em, Pops.   Not at all.  It was fascinating.   You and 'Honey'?   I'm sorry --   What's the way?   I agree --   I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?   So you're a one-girl guy?   How'd you know?   Me?  Internal medicine.  The Young Man smiles.   I could be her.   Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.   Not at all.   I've got patients coming in --   'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?   You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?   You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --   I've got to go --   No, it was so right it scares me.   Why?   Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.   Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.  She hurries away down the sidewalk, the Young Man watching her.  Now he turns and starts off in the opposite direction.    She looks back at the Young Man, then turns and walks on.    She looks around once more but the Young Man is still headed in the opposite direction, his back to her.  She turns the corner and continues on.   Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late - had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --   ...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --  She kisses Drew in some light, humorous way they have ob- viously done before, their heads bobbing like plastic water toys and their lips meeting mid-air.  At the kiss's conclusion Susan suddenly notices Joe is present and has been watching.  She is shocked, embarrassed, pleased, conflicted, an instant and wide spectrum of emotions.   What are you doing here?  Silence.    We've met.   -- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.   That's your name?   In this house?   Incidentally, 'Joe' what?   So, what are you doing here?  Parrish tenses, but Joe doesn't answer.   Cat got your tongue?  You weren't so silent this morning.  Drew reacts to this allusion of intimacy.   What 'business'?   Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.   What are you doing here?   -- Can't seem to escape you today.   Hand me one of those, will you?  Joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the spoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand, can't manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed, now implants the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and presents it to Susan.   You must have something really big going on with my father --   You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.   Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.   What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?   You act like you never had peanut butter before --   -- What kind of childhood did you have?   Come again?   Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.   No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.   I've got plenty of friends.   I can see why.  She finishes drying herself, drops the towel on a chair, and prepares to leave.   Yes --?   I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.  A moment.   Yes?   Goodnight, Joe.   Shall we dance?  Joe is completely puzzled, finally Susan heads for one door, Joe for another.   Joe --   I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.  Susan indicates yet another door.   Joe --   Why did you come here?  Joe doesn't have an answer.   Are you ill?   Then why are you here, Joe?   I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --   Watch me do what?   That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --   Patients have visitors, not doctors.    Just a minute, please.    What's obeah?   Have you filled out the insurance forms?  Teena shakes her hand anxiously.  Joe leans forward to Easter and speaks softly in perfect, lilting West Indian dialect.    Go with her.  I'll be right there.  Teena goes.  Joe remains his normal voice.   Yes.  Susan regards Joe, puzzled.   Have you spent a lot of time in the islands?   Don't apologize.  There's nothing to be sorry for -- every hospital should have someone like you.  Silence.   Well...I'm glad you came.   Yes.  She doesn't move, they search for words.   Joe, I'm with Drew.   I have to go, I'm sorry to say --   Yes.  Well...thank you, Joe.  Susan turns to go, hesitates.   Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --   You think so?   I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.   It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.   Excuse me?   And I appreciate you, too.  A moment between them.   Look who's talking.   It'll come back, Daddy.   Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?   We'll be here.   Why do you love peanut butter so much?   I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?  Joe is locked on Susan, it is as if there is nobody else in the room.   It comforts you, doesn't it?   I am, too.   We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.   Joe visited the hospital today.  Parrish's head swivels to Joe.   ...See you tomorrow night.   You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --   Drew, you're out of line.   Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?   Well... goodnight.   How long have you been standing there?   Tell me about yourself, Joe.  Who you are.  What you're doing with my father.  Susan's directness has caught him by surprise, Joe blinks.   So you're not going to tell me?  Joe remains silent, rendered extremely anxious by Susan's inquiries.   You're married, aren't you?   Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.  Joe doesn't respond.   So you are married.   Girlfriend?   Gay?   Then tell me, Joe, how come a man as attractive, intelligent, well- spoken ,diffident in the most sed- uctive way, and yet powerful, is all alone in this world?  Joe tries to respond but he can't, his stammer interrupted by Susan.   I'm sorry, I don't want to pry and you don't want to tell me.  So let's leave it a mystery.  That's the way you want it, isn't it?  Susan takes another step closer to Joe.   Where are you going?    'To bed'?   Yeah, it's good to get together.   Raise away.   Well, remember how you told me about \"lightning striking\"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.  Parrish drops another cube of ice in his drink, takes his time before answering.   Then what will you say?   Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?   When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.   It's something.  She kisses him.   G'night, Daddy.  See you tomorrow. This is getting interesting.  She goes.   Drew!  He stops.   Never talk to my father like that again.    Why don't you get off his case?   That's it.  It's over.  Get out.    I said get out.  Now Drew wheels, heads right for the front door and exits with a SLAM.   I'm sorry about --   No.  We don't.  They drift, osmotically, into the library in awkward silence.   Brave you had a chance to look at Dad's rare books?  Jefferson's Parliamentary Manual, a first edition Bleak House --  Joe comes closer, takes a deep breath.   -- I guess you haven't.  Now Susan, close to Joe, leans closer, her nose in Joe's neck.  Joe holds himself very still.   I like your smell, too.   It was everything.  Silence, the TICKING of the clock.   When I was little, my mother used to say, \"Darling, you could set your heart by this clock\".   Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?   You're welcome.  Susan reaches out for Joe, they kiss, he is awkward but his very awkwardness endearing.  Susan pulls him closer, they linger now, mouths on each other's, then separate.   Thank you.   Joe?  The apprehensive expression on Joe's face fades away.   I don't know who you are.   And is your heart beating strangely?   I have to go home.  But neither Susan nor Joe moves.   Don't I?  Her question makes Joe, almost involuntarily, smile.  Susan takes the opportunity to step back from him.  The SOUND of someone at the door, it is Parrish, Susan turns, comprehends immediately how the situation will appear to him.   Goodnight, Daddy.  She drifts right past him, exits.  Joe and Parrish are left alone now, eyes on each other's.   You're here?   I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --   Just throw it on the chair.  Joe holds her coat carefully on the chair.  An awkward moment, the two of them shifting from foot-to-foot.   When I called, they said that you and Daddy had just left the office.   He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --   No, not anymore.  Are you?  Joe hears the question but doesn't answer, sits down on the couch beside her.    Are you cold?   Maybe it's the draft through the door.  She gets up, closes the door, sits back down again next to Joe.  A warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each other, now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recognizes as such, Joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but has no knowledge where it is leading.  His movements are instinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin- gers, odd things about her seem to interest him.  This excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the very sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other are intuitive and spontaneous; even though Joe has no know- ledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions are such that they never beg the question -- has he done it before.  Strange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exert- ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak- ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and Susan builds.  Joe has found himself in an unexplored land of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet at the same time, is terrified by it.  He feels himself being lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on. The powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and in the end there is the knowledge they have together made a journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of events they have created; and they don't care about the consequences.  Spent, they lie in silence.  Finally Susan speaks:   It's so wonderful to make love to you.  It's like making love to some- one who has never made love before.  Joe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has said, but to tell her more, even the truth about himself. He weighs, then resists, the impulse.   Did you like making love to me?   More than you love peanut butter?   Where are you going?   For how long?   Me, too.  Another moment.   It will come to us.   Where's Joe?   Where is he?   Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.   Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.  Parrish blinks, stares down at his cards.   Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?   What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.  Parrish tries to get hold of himself, changes gear now.   Where's he going?   C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --   I love him.   Of course not, Daddy.  I'm sorry.  There is something in Susan's tone that lets him know not a word has sunk in.  Parrish slumps.   I love you, too.  She kisses Parrish, rearranges one of his ranks of cards, shuffles through the deck, turns over the top card, lays down a card Parrish needs.   Lightning does strike.  Parrish watches as Susan turns, disappears out the door.   I like you in a black tie.   It beats a surgical, doesn't it?  He smiles.   Daddy told me you might be leaving?   Where are you going?  Joe attempts to answer, but nothing comes out.   You won't tell me?   And you can't tell me who you are.  Again the same indescribable gesture from Joe.   I'm in love with a man, I don't know who he is, where he's going or when.   It gets worse.   Then don't.  A moment.   We know all that we need to know --   Don't.  That will come later.   Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --  Another moment.   'Love will find out the way'.   It's a saying.   Yes, that's why I said it.  They are on the brink of some decision, Joe is about to make some declaration when Allison is heard --   Hello, Joe.  What'd you know?  She smiles.   There's something so indescribably sexy about you in a crowd.  I could make love to you right here.  He hesitates, reaches out to take her hand, studies it.   If you're going to tell my future, you're on the wrong side.  A moment.   But you can't.  Joe is about to respond but doesn't.   Just then -- when you hesitated -- the way you shift from foot-to-foot, I've always found endearing but just now -- I got a chill.  But he drifts again, now she takes his hand.   Remember that morning in the coffee shop?  You said 'What's wrong with taking care of a woman, she takes care of you --\"   And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.  Joe shifts, she smiles at his embarrasement.   Well, you've found one, Joe.   -- That was the place... and you were the guy.  Joe seems resigned now, the air gone out of him.   And you said you didn't want me to be your doctor because you didn't want me to examine you --?  Well, I got to examine you after all --  Joe blinks, at a loss.   I could come with you --   You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --  Joe doesn't answer, Susan is suddenly anxious.   Why do I want this night to last forever?   You said before you couldn't tell me who or where, only the 'when' -- Is when now?  A moment.   That felt like a goodbye.  Joe's silence is heavy.   What's going on, Joe?  I feel like we're lifting off --   But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --  Joe is struggling with a response, finally, inevitably, he drifts into a long silence.  Susan is beside herself, her emotions tossed in every direction, Joe steadies her.   Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --   Hold me --  He holds on tight to her.  They are desperately entwined until finally she releases him.   -- Yes?   What a night.   You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --   Are you relieved?   But what?   Daddy --   I love you, Daddy --   'No regrets'.  A long silence, Susan smiles.   Everybody's saying goodbye...  They regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an understanding.   Oh, yes --  He starts to lead her to the floor, immediately stops.   Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.  He takes her in his arms and they dance away.   The fireworks are about to start.  Parrish looks up, sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting.    Shall we?   Joe...?  He smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right in front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so appealing.  They are riveted on each other, uneasy and yet close.   You're here...  He is trying to get his bearings.   Where did you go?  Joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of time and place.    That's it?   You think so?   The coffee shop --  The Young Man nods, pleased with her recognition.   What has --?  He hesitates.   No --   I said I liked you so much.  She falls silent now, overcome by the last moments' revelations.  The Young Man senses her discomfort which is on the edge of pain.   ...We know so little about each other.   I wish you could've known my father...  Another moment.   ...What do we do now?  A long silence.",
        "Drew": "Hello, Beautiful.   Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?   A voice?   What'd it say?   'Yes' to the deal?   Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --   I was saying to Quince we won't need --   Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --   ...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?   It's going to be great --   Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.  Parrish smiles, they step into the elevator.   Their PR guy asked me, what did I think Parrish Communications stood for, that's principle and ethics- wise?  I came up with something, but then it occurred to me, why don't I ask Bill?  What do you think?  A moment, Parrish shrugs.   That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.  Drew opens a door, a conference room, a circle of top exec- utives, now stepping out from the group is a huge, white- haired man, JOHN BONTECOU, 55.   I'm all excited --   I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --   You have a way with words.  They stride to the main bank of elevators.   So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?    Olympic.  Parrish disappears into his office.  Drew, on his way out, glides past Jennifer's desk.   This is our lucky day.  Jennifer acknowledges Drew with a smile, rises and moves to Parrish's doorway, waiting for the day's instructions, but Parrish only nods to the door and Jennifer quickly closes it, returns to her desk.   He's coming.   Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.   Good, maybe they'll drown him out.  Parrish is still not hearing a word, preoccupied with the return of Luisa.    You're overthinking it --   (pleasantly, going  along with the joke Yeah, something he goes by --   Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.   What?!   Just plain 'Joe'?   'Joe...'   Is there any more to it?   Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'  Parrish's face reveals a desperate searching for a last name, a furtive glance at Joe.  Parrish's brow darkens and a name tumbles from his lips:    Have we met?   You and Bill old friends?  Parrish jumps in:    I get the feeling you've done some business before.   What side of the industry did you say you were on?    Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?  Parrish falls silent again, looking for an answer.   I'm sorry -- business at dinner...  Forgive me for being so rude.   Joe, you do get around.  Joe is happily confounded by all the interaction.   Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?   'Here'?    -- Did I hear 'business'?   That was 'Joe'.   Very.  Susan's eyes are still on the door where Joe exited, her face reflecting her irritation and bewilderment, as well as a tinge of excitement.   (after a moment, to  Joe Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.    The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --   Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?   Hot or cold.   And a glass.  Drew indicates to the Board's Stenographer to arrange Joe's refreshments.   To review -- we're really crossing the 't's and dotting the 'i's here. Bill had a great and conclusive meeting with John Bontecou yester- day, all that remains for us is to put it to a vote.  Smiles and murmurs of a congratulatory receptiveness from the Board at Drew's news.    ...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.   That's your privilege, Bill.  But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes.  Joe interjects:   Yes.   Yes.   It's just a saying, Mr. Black,   It doesn't matter.   You're not familiar with the phrase, \"In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes\"?   Glad I could be of some help.  The Board is provoked and mystified by Joe and even more by his presence, they cast meaningful glances at Parrish, Drew coolly grasps the irritation of the members.  Parrish breaks the silence.   But the matter's still on the table, Bill --  EDWARD SLOANE, a contemporary of Parrish's, has been warily silent, but extremely observant.  Protective of Parrish, and sensing his burgeoning difficulty, he interrupts:   Who is that guy?  Drew grabs a telephone:   Felicia?    Get me a Field Background check on Joe Black.  Litigations. Bankrupt- cies.  Credit ratings.  The works. Got it?  Drew hangs up.   May I interrupting?    'Just kidding'?   Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.    How nice for you both.  Drew takes a moment, then plunges in.   Bill, pardon my candor, but I was confounded by your decision this morning.   I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --  Joe interrupts:    I thought this was practically a done deal --   Okay.  Drew heads for the door, turns around.    Can I invite myself to dinner tonight?  Susan and I had ticket for the Knicks game.  But she said you guys were getting together --    Damn decent of you.  Drew exits.    Good question.  Allison sees Susan's eyes flicker over towards Joe.   Thanks, Quince.   Are you?   'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?   'It's up to Joe', huh?   Well, that's very interesting.  Drew gazes intently over at Joe who is crossing to Susan, for the moment by herself near the piano.   Yeah.  Neat.   As much as Joe's?  Parrish doesn't answer.   Who is this man?  He's giving ubiquitous a bad name.  A moment.   For how long?  And why?   Boss's orders, huh?  I'm great at following them.  And I think I'll start right now.  Allison calls out from the other side of the room:   I have a confession to make to you, Joe.  Joe just smiles in response.   Do you want to hear it?   Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.   Mind if I throw up?   Who are we talking about?   Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?   Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.   I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?   You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?  Silence.  Parrish regards Joe, then Susan, his face reflects a sudden concern with their relationship.   I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.   Sure.  Drew peels off, heads for the foyer and front door, Susan follows him.  Parrish corners Joe.   Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.   Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.   That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.   No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.  Silence, neither knows how to continue.   Yeah.  Goodnight.  Drew goes, Susan turns to find out at the far end of the foyer, he's been observing them.  She walks up to him.   ...I know you're all as uncomfor- table as I am to be meeting without Bill, but I got a call last night from John Bontecou.  Not only is he still interested, he is sweetening his offer.  Although it pains me to say it, in my opinion Bill Parrish dealt with us peremptorily in dismissing any deal with Bontecou.  Therefore, I'm sorry to say that if we are to exam- ine this new offer responsibly as the Board of Directors of Parrish Communications, we must do so with- out its Chairman.  Oh yes, there is one additional element: Bontecou is so anxious to get us, he said he'd take Parrish Communications with our Chairman or without.  The Board falls silent.  Sloane, a peer of Parrish's, fidgets.  Drew milks the moment.   It's no surprise if I suggest to you that the Bill Parrish we know is not the Bill Parrish you saw yesterday. You heard that speech -- some strange emotional rationale to buttress a knee-jerk rejection of a legitimate offer.  Does it not strike you that something is possibly affecting this man's judgement?  More specifically -- his judgement to make a critical business decision?  Silence, the Board clocking Drew's argument.   It's not pleasant to say the follow- ing, but I would be remiss, in this crisis, if I did not.  When we pre- sent Bill with the improved Bontecou offer, and if he refuses to let us consider it -- once more makes an adamant or emotional rejection -- we will have no choice but to seek an alternative.   Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.   Am I not obligated to?  Drew leans over to Felicia, speaks quietly and she leaves the room.   How did this all come about?  Crisis -- Bill Parrish, crisis -- his com- pany, crisis for us.  I came about with the arrival on the scene of -- Mr. Joe Black.  Mr. Joe who?  Joe Black.  He attends our Board meet- int, he sleeps at Bill's house, re- sides in his office.  Never leaves his side.  And, in my opinion, is always in his ear.  Telling him what to do and Bill is listening.  Who is Joe Black?  What is his relationship to Bill Parrish?  And most important, what is behind his influence on our Chairman?   Thank you for coming.    I hope you'll respect its nature -- What we're trying to do here is gather our thoughts -- in light of Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer -- and make an appropriate presenta- tion to him as to how we think the company might proceed.  Won't you share with our Board the information you gave me last night?  Quince hesitates, then realizes what Drew has on his mind. He nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the Board.   How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?    -- But he was concerned about the timing?   'It's up to Joe'?    Sorry to intrude, Bill, but we've got a bit of a crisis downtown -- it's not something we could talk about on the phone.  Parrish takes Drew aside.   The Board's real unhappy, Pappy -- they felt you dealt with them pre- emptorily, you never gave them a chance to speak --   Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.   If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.   What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?   With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.  Silence, Parrish carefully calibrating Drew's remark.   Yours.   I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.  Joe, although across the room, is all attention.   Certainly.  Goodnight.  Drew goes, everybody is in shock, Susan pursues him out into the hallway.   Don't worry about it.  There's a beginning and a middle and an end to everything.  And I think I've come to the end of my chapter with the Parrishes.  Joe has followed them into the hallway.   And the end began with this guy.  Drew looks down towards Joe.   Mr. Black --?  We ran a check on you and you know what we came up with?   Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.  Joe waits.   All of a sudden a guy appears on the scene with the Chairman of one of the greatest communications corpora- tions of the world, the boss makes him privy to all the company's secrets, he attends the Board meet- ings, and us working stiffs with MBA's up the ass and years and years and years of experience, we're left outside with our noses pressed against the window.  Joe doesn't respond.   This is a big-time operation, deal- ing in big-time issues, demanding big-time executives who make big- time decisions.  So, Joe, why don't you tell me exactly what it is that's big time about you?  After a moment.   Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.   So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?  Joe clears his throat.   Did you say something?  Joe considers him evenly.   Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?    To get to the point, we have re- ceived new information from John Bontecou concerning his desires for this company to merge with his, and we wanted to set the details before you.  A moment as Parrish looks around, the moment extends, it appears he may not ever answer.   Bontecou wants a quick response and --   Don't you want to hear the details?   So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?   Certainly, Bill.   Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.   Before we do, while we're here, there is a second question the Board would like a response to, a far simpler one.  Parrish waits.   Who is the man sitting to the right of you?  Everybody's eyes are on Joe.   But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?  No response from Parrish.   The feeling of the Board is this: we fear Mr. Black is not only influenc- ing your decisions in regard to this company, but that you are relying on him to make them for you.  Quince flinches at these words, his hands clasped in front of him, his knuckles white as Parrish regards Drew, but still does not answer.   The lack of response, Bill, is not appropriate.  We are your Board, we have a right to know how you are managing the operations of this company, and most importantly, that you have not delegated someone to do it for you.  Parrish squirms, desperately uncomfortable but still does not speak.   Okay, one more time.  Drew regards Joe.   Who is Joe Black?  Parrish stares stoically into the middle distance as Quince's head sinks into his hands.    A motion has been brought before the Board to invoke Article 19 of the corporate charter.   Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.  Parrish is expressionless.   At which time, the Chairman will be named Emeritus, he will be welcome to attend all meetings, and will serve as International Spokesman for the corporation plus, of course, a settlement, a golden parachute of such magnitude that his feet will never touch the ground.  Drew pauses.   Please indicate your vote by a \"Yes\" or \"No\".  A \"Yes\" is heard, now another \"Yes\", now more \"Yes\"es, all reluctant, \"No\" from Sloane, \"No\" from Quince who realizes he is the instrument of Parrish's dismissal.   The motion is passed.  We will of course delay the announcement, out of respect for our former Chairman, until after the celebration of his birthday this weekend.    The other motion before us is the acceptance of John Bontecou's offer to merge this corporation with Bontecou International --  Parrish stands, Drew stops speaking.   That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you stupid the coup de grace.  Quince falls silent, aquiver with this reality.   Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.   The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.  Quince is struck dumb.   Don't you know what this'll mean? You'll be rich.  You'll sell your stock, you can stop kissing ass -- What'll it feel like to be a man?   Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.  Quince goes ashen.   It's just life, Quin-cee.  Drew hails an employee across the hall.    Wake up and smell the thorns.  Drew joins the employee as Quince slumps against the wall.   This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.   He said that?   Yeah, the short, gray hairs.  He flashes a pleased-as-punch greeting to some unseen acquaintance as they press on to Parrish's study.   Hi, Bill, happy birthday --  A moment.   I just wanted to say how appre- ciative I am of this - uh - grand gesture and --   I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --   Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.  Joe can no longer control himself.    So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.   I'm not stepping anywhere --   The dagger --?   I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --   And what do I get?   You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.   All right, you win.  As soon as I get back to the city, I'll meet with the Board.  Sloane's voice erupts over the SPEAKERPHONE.   Who would've ever believed it?  You, an IRS Agent --  Silence.  Joe shrugs, smiles.",

He's had advisors be- fore.  Nobody tells Bill what to do.  The door opens and Felicia enters followed by Quince, sur- prised at seeing a convened Board, but still he is all smiles.   Hello, Quince.    This is a secret meeting.   We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --   He'll wait --    ...It's not over, 'til it's over.   I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?   I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.  The elevator door opens, Parrish and Joe step inside and the door closes, leaving Sloane behind.    Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?    The Board's working through the weekend, trying up the loose ends this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.    No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.    Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?    We're all here, Bill --    We're all ears.  Drew enters with Quince, Quince nods, excusing himself, and closes the door behind him.   You're meeting with the Board right now, Drew.  Resignation accepted. Moreover, I propose a motion to re- confirm William Parrish as Chairman of the Board of Parrish Communica- tions as well as a rejection of the merger with Bontecou International. How say you, Board?  A chorus of thunderous \"Yes\"es resounds through the  The motion is passed.   But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.",
        "Quince": "...This shit's not bad.   (pointing to another  bottle And that?   What do you do that for?   9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.  Quince drains his wine, presents it for a refill, when he is hailed by Allison.   Hi, Bill --   How're you doing--?   I am, this is it.  B Day.   Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.   Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!   Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it -- (indicates Drew and  Parrish -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?   I know.  Gum up the works.  Parrish is about to make some reassuring comment to Quince when the Voice suddenly intrudes:   He said he would be there with bells on.   No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.  Luisa returns to Parrish as the others' conversation drones on:   I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.   Me, too.  Hey, buddy!  Joe, turned on by Quince's broad smile, reacts to it as Drew squints observingly at Joe.   'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.    You bet.  I'm kind of my Rotisserie League.   Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.   You know what I'm saying, Joe?   How long you here, Joe?   Well, I guess he's found one.   Great!  Parrish pushes his plate away.   Hey, this is fun.   Don't bother asking, we already tried.    ...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.   But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.   Yeah.  Or the week after.  Quince sees Parrish hesitate.   No good?   Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.   No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --  An excited Quince drains his drink and heads for Drew as Allison appears.   ...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.   Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.   We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.   Yeah.   Yeah, that's what he said.   I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.   I love little girls --  Allison elbows him.   You bet.   I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.   Hi, Ed, hi folks, I didn't know everybody was going to be here, what a nice surprise.  What's the big confab?   Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.   He was interested.   The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.   That's what he said.  Quince, having dispensed his information, looks proudly around at the Board members.  They are stunned, Sloane in shock.  Drew is absolutely still, letting Quince's words sink in.   This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.   But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?   See.  There.  What'd I tell you?  Joe watches as Quince dabs at Allison's tears with a napkin.   Feel better?   But what?   The vodka.  What'd I tell you?  Quince puts a reassuring arm around Allison, she seems to relax now, Joe has been a keen observer of what has trans- pired between husband and wife, between man and woman, a sense that he has taken in the virtue of such a relation- ship.   I didn't know that.   You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...   Thanks.   What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!   I'm going to put a stop to this!   But I didn't mean to do it!   I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.   Give me a Seagrams and '7'.  Ambrose looks at him blankly.   Okay, give me a bottle of wine.   Both.  Joe appears, looking bewildered, jostled by caterers setting up last-minute tables, a drummer from the band rolls his traps past on a little cart.  Joe doesn't seem to know where he is, when his eyes alight on Quince, he heads for this oasis.  Ambrose sets down two bottles of wine and departs.    Red or white?   C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.   Confused, huh?  About what?   'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.   Oh yes, I do.   I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.   Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.   Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.   Free to love each other.  Com- pletely.  Totally.  No fear.  Quince seems uncharacteristically within himself.   All that hoopla up there reminds me how I will never measure up to a man like Bill Parrish - or his daughter.  He drains his wine.   Do you like me, Joe?   What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?  Joe regards Quince.   You think so?  How do you know?   Well, maybe... I guess you know him better than anybody.  Another moment.   Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?   ...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --   Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?    Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?   Oh, that could be a tall order, B.P. I doubt that Drew's anxious to see you face-to-face.  Joe steps in.   You think Drew will go for it?   Sir, I'll deliver the package.  He heads out, Parrish and Joe fall silent.   Bill --?  After a moment.   -- I got him.  The chopper's two minutes away.  Parrish weighs the information for a moment.   He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.   Well, you've got him by the short- hairs."
