        "Maria": "No, honey. It's just green.Hi, it's me. Where are you? Maybe you ate somethingI'll try you on your cell. green.  Hi, Caden. How'd it go?  Great. That's great, Caden! Good  Jesus, it is late. Early!Can we get a ticket for I'd love to see it, too. Maria? Adele smiles.  Absolutely! It's all about your artistic satisfaction, Caden.  Oh, I thought it was wonnnderful!  I live with Adele and Olive and Gunther und Heinz and Uschi and Britt. I'm everyone's nanny.  I want to see my daughter. They sent me.  They? And who the fuck are They decided it's not time to Uschi and Britt? see you yet.  I did that. Olive's my project.  She's almost over eleven now. She's my muse. I love her. Caden stares at her for a moment, then lunges. He punches her repeatedly as she tries to get away. She throws a punch which connects with the side of his head and knocks him down. She hurries off.  Screw you, Caden. Faggot! FAGGOT! She turns down an alley. Caden, a half-block behind, hurries to the alley. She's gone. He walks through, looking for her. It's dark. Trash cans and garbage. He spots an unopened box next to the trash. It's pink with a picture of a nose on it. Caden drops to his knees and weeps. No tears come out. His eyes are dry and red. He pulls a vial of artificial tears from his pockets and moistens his eyes. Suddenly his breathing becomes wildly erratic.      Olive wants to see you. God knows why; the way you abandoned her.  Oh, shut up.She's had a fucked-up life with issues, thanks to you.  You're insane.She's dying, asshole. Is that insane enough for you?  Anyway, she wants to say goodbye to you. God knows the fuck why.  Hello, darling. Hi.  This is him.  In heaven, my darling. Maria exits.  I hope you're happy, faggot. Caden gets up and leaves.",
        "Caden": "Morning. Morning. Tried not to wake you.  Thanks. You didn't. I was just -- As Caden's voice goes under, we follow Adele into --     Caden, could you get that? It's Maria. I don't want to.     I don't feel well.     Of course, honey.  I'm sure I did, honey. Am I going to die?  Of course not. You probablyI didn't! I didn't eat ate something -- green!  It'll be fine, sweetie. I'll be back in a minute.        Harold Pinter died!  Yeah? Huh. Well, he wasOh wait. He won the Nobel old, right?Prize. Good for him.  It's not alive, honey.God, remember that production of The Dumbwaiter I did at Albanyfest? The toilet is flushed.  Sorry, Mommy! I'm sorry! They found Avian flu in Turkey. In the country Turkey not turkeys. It's in chickens. Adele is making a peanut butter sandwich for Olive.  Man. Milk's expired. Jesus. But you are being changed by it. Second by second. Every breath counts off time. Caden goes back to his paper. Adele puts a peanut butter sandwich in front of Olive.  I will. The first black graduate of the University of Alabama died. Vivian Malone Jones. Stroke. Only 63. Adele stares out the window at the rain.          Um. I was shaving and -- My God! Jesus! Look at your head! Dumbly, Caden tries to look up at his forehead, then squints nervously at himself in the mirror.  Do I press above or below it?  Will there be a scar?  I prefer there not be a scar.  What? The doctor feels Caden's pulse, then listens to his heart. He presses hard against the glands in Caden's neck.  A little more yellow than usual. What?  A neurologist?       Oh. The doctor stares blankly at Caden for a long moment, then looks suspiciously in Caden's ears.     My pupils weren't properly dilating and, um, not doing the opposite ...  No. Yes. The bump to the head?  He doesn't know. Maybe. He said he doesn't think so. But maybe. But he doesn't know. But --       Okay. I got it. Jesus.Sorry. I'm a little anxious.  No, honey.  It's the start of something awful.  What? No. Of course not.  This is really fucked timing.  Sorry. Bad timing.Did you tell him I have green poop?  Remind me to call the plumber, would you? I need aI have rehearsal! Fuck! to-do list. Caden!  Sorry.How many years till I have to get more shots?  He's the man who --       Or woman, Dad.Right. He's the man or woman who fixes sinks and toilets and... do you know what pipes are?   Hey, Jim. I know. I'm sorry. I had an accident. No, I'm okay.  Different kind of pipe.  Just run lines. I'll be there soon. 'kay.  Houses have pipes. They're, like, tubes and they're behind walls and under the floor everywhere and -- Olive begins to whimper in horror.  It's okay. They just carry water to and from sinks and bathtubs and toilets. It's like in your body you have veins and ... um...  And they're filled with blood. Olive is crying in earnest now.  I'm trying to explain plumbing.  No, honey, you're fine.  I don't want blood! I don't want blood! I don't wantI can't do this now. blood...  Well, I don't think you should tell her she doesn't have blood.  Thanks for getting me in right away. The doctor touches Caden's eye repeatedly with a small probe.  Is it the bump to the head?       A neurologist?  I know what a neurologist is. Fine. I just thought from the way you asked --  I thought maybe you said urologist. Why do I need to see a neurologist?  That's not true, is it?  It just doesn't seem right.  I'm not sure. Accurate, I guess.  Yeah yeah, I'm fine. It's no Oh crap, Claire, are youbig deal. okay?  David, what's happening here? Sorry, Caden. Hold on. David runs on stage to deal with the mess.  It's too late in the game to be having these problems, David.  You're sure you're okay?  Please.  That was good, Tom.  I saw that. I like it. Caden meets Tom at the foot of the stage. Behind them a group of technicians are lifting the wall and trying to re- set it. Claire primps in the bureau mirror.  Try to keep in mind that a young person playing Willy Loman thinks he's only pretending to be at the end of a life full of despair. But the tragedy is that we know that you, the young actor, will end up in this very place of desolation.  Great. Let's try it again.  How long, David?  Why don't you get cleaned up, Tom, and we'll go again. Tom exits. Caden rubs his temples, then heads to the back of the house, pulling out his cell phone. He exits the theater.  In more ways than one.   In search of elusive signal.       That is odd.  (back in her book) See you in a few. Yup.  Dr. Heshborg said I should see Dr. Scariano. My pupils don't work.  Maybe you should read the first line of another series of books.  Exactly twelve. Have you read Kafka?       His whole name?     I hope you like it.        I think I have blood in my stool. Adele looks over, half asleep.  Yes, of course. Yes. I mean... big time.  It's a nightmare in there.  Well... not only.  Yeah? You like?       You're not an idiot. Pause.  In fact, you're very bright, Hazel. And I love your eyes. Oh, am I? Oh, do you? Oh, darling!  Then what do I say?  Why?     Can I piss in your sink?  It's gorgeous, Ad.  Awful. We have five hundred and sixty lighting cues. I don't know why I made it so complicated.  Yeah. Anyway, we got through it. I think you'll be impressed.  But it's opening night.I know. I'm sorry. I would  I have to get ready.      I'll go tomorrow! We'll makeI mean, I can't take a dump tomorrow like the premiere! in your sink! What am I supposed to do? I have to get ready!  No. You looked great. You I thought Tom was amazing! were great. I was very pleased.  Yeah. Absolutely.  Sorry. I have a bit of a headache.  I'll be around. I'll check in. She gets teary, gives him a kiss on the cheek.  Ok, Claire. She backs away and gets lost in the crowd. Caden massages his temples. Suddenly Hazel is next to him.  Hey!  So you liked it?  Easy on the eyes.     Had to work. Her Berlin show is in two weeks. We're going to spend like a month there.  Ah.  Choo!  Yeah, me too.       You're going to miss you? Yeah, that's it.  I couldn't begin to guess.  Y'know. Sometimes.  I don't know.Come on, it's a party.  I get kind of... something when I'm stoned.  I don't know. Bothered?What does bothered mean?  Y'know... bothered. Horny.     You know I wish I could.  You're not staying for the reviews?       I'm going to Berlin for a month for my wife's show. Then I don't know.  Yay or nay?     Hey. Hey.  Hi. It's late.  We're a hit. Reviews are great. New York Times said it was brilliant to cast young actors as Willy and Linda.  Are you stoned?      Yeah. Love to know what you think.  It's pustules. It's called sycosis. Spelled differently than psychosis, but it sounds the same.  Well, there's two different kinds of psychosis. They're spelled differently. P-s-y is like if you're crazy and s-y is like these things on my face.  I could. But I don't.  Ok.  La-ru-lee.       Okay.  Okay. He stops.  I don't want you to die.  But I'll miss you.       Where will it take you?  I just --I don't know what it matters  I loved the story. So interesting.  Because your opinion is --It was good. It was well  Why were the old people so young?

Be a fucking tool of saying their lives are suburban blue-hair regional changed and -- theater subscribers. But what are you leaving behind? You act as if you have forever to figure it out.       Why are you being like this? Adele has a coughing fit.       I'm not being like anything. Are you seeing someone else?  No. I don't know. It's a stressful time. Our shows. The whole health thing.        I think I might have arthritis. Adele continues to talk on the phone.  My joints are stiff. Who was that?       Right. It's been three hours since you spoke.  Morning, kiddos. Christ. Is this about last night? Caden's father smiles, nods, and exits.     Can I ask you a question, Ad? She looks up at him.  Have I disappointed you somehow? She starts to cry, hugs him.  Be weird.     I have an appointment.  What do you mean?  I won't. Sorry.  I'm lonely.Yes. Anything else?  I'm hurt.Yes. And?  I think Adele's right whenWhat would be real?  I'm afraid I'm going to die. They don't know what's wrong with me. I want to do something important. While I'm still here.       Better?Yes. It's called Getting  Who wrote it?  I did. Oh. (looking at titles) All of these.Wow. I never knew that.        I'm looking for... I'm sorry, I don't speak German. No. I'm --  Hey! Thanks for meeting me. He points to his nose. She wipes at the soot on hers.  I didn't want to be alone.  I'm going through some things.  I can't really. But I'm meditating and running and taking vitamins.        Cutting out sugar. I can't really say any more. It's ...       You tell me something. Oh. I've cut out wheat.  It's beautiful.It's cashmere. So very soft. You must feel it. Hazel holds her arm out. Caden touches it.  What do we do with all this, Hazel?  Do I have to choose at all?  Um ... I'm won't let you off the this time.  Adele is only on vacation.      It's been a week.  Okay, just for one drink. Hazel smiles and stands. She scoops up the torn napkin pieces and puts them in her purse.  I really can't drink very much because of my condition.  Did you put something in it?  Sure, why not?  It's good. She takes a sip of her drink. Caden drinks some more of his.  Yeah. Kind of.  Um, I feel a lot of longing.  Um, okay. Please, Hazel, let On your knees. me --  What?  Why am I doing this?  You'll help me forget my troubles?  I have a wife.  I don't know. I'm sorry. What?  I'm just so confused. I'm sorry. I'm really sick. I think I'm dying. I have a kid. I'm married.  Oh, Jesus. Oh, fuck me.I'm sorry. It's terrible, I   I had a good time. I think you're a very nice person. Really.        It's Caden!   Caden! I can't wait to see you and Olive on the 12th. um... I went someplace without you tonight, Ad. I went some place you couldn't come with me. I'm sorry.  Oh. Ok. Great. Have fu -- The connection is lost. Caden sits there, looks at the 2007 tax form in front of him, goes into convulsions. He manages to grab the phone, his hand flopping all over the dial.  I'm sick.  What does that mean?Seems to be some synaptic  It's serious?     Be quiet, Squishy.Hi.  Okay. Thank you anyway.        So I just got this MacArthurOh, Caden! Grant last night.  Yeah. A lot of money. Do you know what you're going to do with it?  A theater piece. Something big and true and tough. Y'know, finally put my real self into something.  Oh, Caden! What is your realI don't know yet. The self, do you think? MacArthur is called \"the  Yeah, I mean, yeah. Oh, I wanted to ask you, how old are kids when they start to write?  Could a four year old keep a diary?  Really?Little Winky. By Horace Azpiazu.  Aww. Cute.  Wow. Written by a four year old?       That's horrible.  Is that possible?  Any of it. Why did he kill himself?  What?  Oh. I don't know.  I'm looking for a Christmas present for my daughter. Something pink.  Yes. That's good.  The idea is to do a massive theater piece. Uncompromising, honest. I don't know what it is yet or how to do it, but it'll come. It'll reveal itself.  HereÃ¢â¬â¢s what I think theater is: itÃ¢â¬â¢s the beginning of thought. The truth not yet spoken. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s a blackbird in winter. The moment before death. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s what a man feels after heÃ¢â¬â¢s been clocked in the jaw. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s love... in all its messiness. And I want all of us, players and audience alike, to soak in the communal bath of it, the mikvah, as the Jews call it. WeÃ¢â¬â¢re all in the same water, after all, soaking in our very menstrual blood and nocturnal emissions. This is what I want to try to give people, Hazel. And I want your help. Hazel just stares. The food arrives. Caden looks at his plate and concentrates.       Salivating.  I have to concentrate.  Biofeedback training.  So I was wondering if you'll help.  No. Like as my assistant.  I just want to normalize it, Hazel. I think we'd have fun together. He swallows some food then concentrates. She watches him.  I miss you. He concentrates some more. She stares at him.  I'm digesting.  We'll start by talking honestly. Out of that a piece of theater will evolve. I'll begin.         I've been thinking a lot about dying lately.  I appreciate that, Claire, but --  Well, you are. You poor regardless of how this thing.particular thing works itself out, I will be dying. So will you.  Caden!So will everyone here. And I want to explore that unflinchingly. There is a long silence as everyone looks uncomfortable.  We are all hurtling toward death.  Yet here we are, for the moment, alive. Each of us knowing we will die; each of us secretly believing we won't. Nobody says anything for a long moment.     Hi. I haven't heard from you so I thought I'd say hi. Hi, Hazel! He giggles crazily, coughs, then hangs up, embarrassed, grimaces once more, then dials again.  Hi, Claire, it's Caden.Hi! I was just thinking about you!  Yeah? Um, I was calling to say hi, chat about today maybe.  Yeah. Do you maybe want to get a drink or something? It's late so --  Oh, hey.  Hi, Hazel. Hi, Claire.  Hi, Derek. Hi, Derek.  How's everything, Haze... ul?  Good. It's good to see you.  So --We'll leave you be.  No, of course. It was nice Take care. seeing you. Caden and Claire go to Caden's booth.       Yeah, I guess. Caden steals glances at Hazel, chatting animatedly, throughout his conversation with Claire. He hears occasional snippets.  Really? Why?  I don't know what I'm doing.  I don't know.  Hmm?  Oh. Well, we'll build it over time together. Find a real person, maybe, to model it after.  Um, yeah. Something to think about. Sure. Although --  Y'know, why is she still I don't know. Probably not working in a box office at that interesting. her age?  There's got to be a storyYeah. Could be. We'll talk there. Did she want to be an about it. actress but lacked confidence? You seem distracted.  No. I have these health issues.  Um...Well, we can talk more  I'm sorry.  When I get tired I have to remember to breathe. It's a new thing. My autonomic functions are failing.  I'm just ...  My God. I'm so sorry. What are you doing out?  Oh. I see. Well, um, What happened to your mother, if I could ask? I mean, God, that's an awful thing to ask. I'm sorry. I don't mean to -- It's just that, I'm --  In half?  Slip of the tongue is all.Freudian slip.  I don't know how it's Freudian.  Oh. Well, I'm sorry about your mother. In half?  What is it? What? She weeps silently, with gaping mouth. Caden awkwardly embraces her. She remains stiff.  Do you want me to drive you home? She shakes her head \"no\" over and over. Then she looks in at her reflection in the car window.  It's okay. Everyone does that. It's -- is there anything I can do?  I'm so sorry.  There was a knock at theGod, you're beautiful. door.   lolling, breathing her\"You can have this ring if in) you promise me one thing.\" I have to fuck you. I have\"Anything,\" I whispered in to. his ear. Caden and Claire are having sex now.  I'm so in love with you. Claire smiles, strokes his hair.  I have problems, Claire. I'm still attached to my wife. I have also -- I have also -- feelings for Hazel.  I've left them behind. I've gone somewhere without them. I'm guilty of so much.  There will be no other before you.      Okay, hold it. We're not really -- I think we need to work on your characters individually. We need to investigate, to really discover the essence of each being. Davis, I'll start with you. Caden walks off with Davis. Claire seethes.  That's not the point. Apparently not. I would've guessed you were sleeping with Davis.  We'll talk about your Maybe you are. I just want character after we get Arielto feel what we used to feel. to bed. Okay? Y'know?  I think you should pick another subject. Other than Hazel.  No. It's just. I don't feel like there's enough there. Claire thinks for a moment.  Tell me.  Caden, I've made aI have to go find my breakthrough. This woman is daughter. beautiful. I've got --  My real daughter.  What? My first daughter. Olive. I've got to find her.  She's tattooed!  I've never seen that before.You have responsibilities.  I'll be quick. I'll do it quick.  I'm not sure I'm getting the book.  I don't speak German. I was - Yes yes. I may help you,  I'm looking for Adele Cotard.  I'm her husband.  You're here, too?  I want to see my daughter. They sent me.  They? And who the fuck are They decided it's not time to Uschi and Britt? see you yet.  Maria, I can't believe Adele got her tattooed like that. I mean --  She's a four year old!  What'd you do to my family? What'd you do to my daughter?  Yeah, I want to bring my production to New York. To get it seen. By people, you know, who matter. The sooner the better.  Yeah?Yeah. Very much so.  Daddy! Daddy is mine!Daddy can't play now, honey.  Ok, you're a doctor, right? Am I dying? Can you tell me that?       No, you can't tell me?   What are you doing here? You look great.  Oh, thanks. You... I --New haircut?  What are you doing in New York?  The boys?  Ah. Congratulations. Yeah. Thanks.  How old?       Ah. Yes.  Nice names. Where are they?  Ah.  YÃ¢â¬â¢know. I was with Claire. We have a daughter, but we're separated now. How about with you?  Great. You wear a lab coat?  Okay. Good seeing you, Hazel. Hazel smiles and waves and turns to head into the store. Caden watches after her.         It's me.  I want to come back. I want to take care of you and Olive. Ariel. There's silence then the door opens. Claire is crying.  Hello? What's wrong? Okay. Okay. Caden hangs up. Claire kisses Caden's neck.  My father died.  His body was riddled with cancer. He didn't even know. He went in because his finger hurt.  They said he suffered horribly. That he called out for me right before he died. They said he said he regretted his life. They said he said a lot of things. Too many to recount. They said it was the longest and saddest deathbed speech any of them had ever heard.     Excuse me, I have to use the bathroom.     Hey.  I had to talk to you. My father died.  Thanks. I know.Are you at your mom's?  Yeah. With Claire and Ariel.  Oh. I see. I'm back with Claire. Pause.  I'm sorry. What are you sorry about?  I don't know. You got quiet. I thought I should say something.       What am I supposed to do, Hazel? I have a kid with her. You have twins with Derek. Three twins. It's confusing!  You're not supposed to do I really miss you. anything.  Hazel...I'm asking you a question. Did you have sex with her now that you're back together?  Yes. Of course. I mean, what --  Hazel, please, I can't bear it if you go.  I need to use a cane now.  Okay. Take care. Hazel hangs up. Caden sits there.  Get out of bed. I'm depressed.  I'd just like a little sympathy.       Millennia dead? What? And since when do you care about anything?  Hazel! Hazel and Derek turn.  Caden, what are you doing Sorry. Can I talk to you? here? Please? Hazel kisses Derek, whispers something in his ear. They share a giggle. Derek waves at Caden and heads into the burning house. Hazel approaches Caden's car.  Tell me what to do.  Caden, everyone has to figure I want you to look at me like out their own life. Y'know? you used to.          I don't want you to be okay. I mean, I do but it rips my guts out.  I'll help you through, too.  I won't settle for anything less than the brutal truth. Brutal! Each day I'll hand you a scrap of paper. It'll tell you what happened to you that day. \"You felt a lump in your breast. You looked at your wife and saw a stranger.\" Etcetera.  Caden, when are we going to And I'm not excusing myself get an audience in here?from this either. I will It's been seventeen years.have someone play me, to delve into the murky, cowardly depths of my lonely, fucked-up being. He'll get notes, too. And they will correspond to the \"notes\" I truly get each day from my God. The actors glance uncomfortably at Claire. She smiles apologetically.  Oh God.  Um, I have an assistant,Please, Caden. Everything is Hazel. And there's no box falling apart. I miss you. office yet. There are problems at home. I'm worthless. I'm fat. What am I going to do? Nobody laughs at my jokes the way you did.  Good. Tell me why you're here.  Yes, okay. You've got the part. Sammy nods and exits. Hazel follows him with her eyes.  Please don't fall in love with him.  It's new. Sammy jots a note. Caden places his backpack on a sink. He looks at himself in the mirror, stalling.  No. Check your bag. Caden pulls out books and notebooks and a sweater. The pill falls out of the sweater onto the grimy floor.  When it's ready.  I was thinking of calling it Simulacrum. What do you think?  How about The Flawed Light of Love and Grief?  No, thanks.No, thanks, Claire.  Claire? I want you to drop your  Caden -- I want you to play yourself.  It's just that I've made suchAs the vision reveals itself, enormous strides as Jocelynwe all have to be willing to and -- adapt, honey.  She left us. You know that better than anyone. Except me.  How do you know that?  Anyway, I don't know where she is. A strange dirigible flies very low overhead.  Why are you giving this to me?  I'm sorry. I pressed it, butYou didn't press it. I think it was too late. Caden continues to walk down the hall. The old person walks behind him. Caden looks behind him and smiles awkwardly.  Have a good night. He picks up his pace, trying to be casual about it. He arrives at 31Y, glances over and sees the old person knocking feebly on a door down the hall.       What?     Ok. Thank you. Old Person #2 turns and heads back down the hall to Old Person #1, whose nose has started to bleed.  I went for a walk. I had to think.  No! What do I smell like? Like bad? Like an old person?  Good, Jimmy!  That's great, you guys. Sammy sits at the table and starts to write on scraps of paper. Hazel hovers behind him, watching.  Beautiful, Sammy. Caden leaves the set and steps onto his platform.  What's up? I feel we need a Hazel in here. There's a whole side of Caden I'm not able to explore without a Hazel. Caden looks over at Hazel. Claire watches Caden from the street corner.  I guess, yeah. Claire walks off in a huff.  Hi Adele. Relined the cabinets. Just wanted to let you know I won a MacArthur Grant and I'm mounting a play, which I think is going to be pure and truthful. Best -- Caden hesitates for a moment, then signs it \"Ellen.\"  I didn't say I was going to clean Hazel's toilet. He did.  I thought it. But I didn't say it. Claire packs up her stuff.  Jesus. Claire! Please!   Yeah.  This is the end of my stuff.        This is a lie! Caden paces. The actors stop what they're doing, sit with their legs dangling off the edge of their apartments, wait for instructions. Caden limps off to the set designer's office.  Wall it up.     Sorry.  Oh, shit. I need to do that, too. Haze, keep an eye on things?  Will, I need you to build this. Caden hands Will shots of the exterior and interiors of Adele's building and of apartment 31Y.      Hazel, what do you think of this title: Unknown, Unkissed, and Lost?  Hi, Millicent. Have a seat. How are you at cleaning?  Because this part requires a lot of it. You'd play a cleaning lady.  Great. Okay. And Mrs. Dobson in Scrub-a-  You're weirdly close to what I've visualized for this character.  Good work, everyone. Nobody acknowledges him.      Where're Sammy and Hazel? Tammy jerks her head to the left. Caden sees that Sammy has Hazel with her back against a wall. They are talking intimately. Caden approaches.  Hey, Sammy, what are you doing? Sammy and Hazel look over casually.  This Hazel doesn't exist for you. If you want to like a Hazel, like that one. Caden points indicates Tammy. Sammy squints over.  Hazel. What?  You don't like him, do you?  I'm me. You don't need someone to remind you of me.       I'm fun.  Yes?Is this Caden Cotard?  Yes.This is Officer Mark Mellman of Schnectady P.D.  Yes?I'm sorry to inform you, your mother has been the victim of a home invasion.     Was my father standing with us?  He's dead. He looks dead, I guess.  A little moustache? She shrugs.  I asked Hazel but she was busy tonight and you're the next best thing. I mean, it isn't that you're the next best thing but because you play her, it feels comforting. Does that make sense? Although the thing is offstage you're nothing like her. You play her very well though. Did Hazel mention what she was doing tonight because I called her house before we left and her husband said she wasn't going to be back till late and I thought that was weird because she told me Philip was sick.     He's supposed to like me.I'll have another talk with Caden gets up and turns to leave.  Thank you, Yammy. Caden takes the phone and limps off.     Hey. What you up to?  Why didn't you tell me that before?  It mostly makes me sad that it doesn't make you sad.  I want you to be sad that we had something really special and it's going away!  Oh, Haze. C'mon. It's just dinner. He's got  He has stories about me!     Did you always want to be an actress?  Is that true?     I thought someone would've cleaned it up.  I don't know! Someone.     This is my room. You can sleep here.  The living room couch.  Um... It's just sex.  Okay. If you think it's okay. Tammy laughs, matter-of-factly gets undressed in front of Caden. He just stands there uncomfortably.  How can you be like that?  In front of someone is different.  Maybe because you have a beautiful body. Maybe that makes it easier.  I do. Yes. Um. Do you?  I'm sorry. I'm very lonely. I don't know what's wrong. I just -- I'm sorry. Can you understand? Do you understand loneliness?  I'm sorry.  You're very pretty.       Sometimes I wish I were pretty like that.   Sometimes I think I might've been better at it.  No. No. I like women. I only like women.  Thanks. Thank you for saying that.          That's Hazel's house. Caden points to the house with smoke seeping out the windows.  Um...  Yeah. I don't know. I have to speak to the fire marshal.  I think both of you Hazels are going to like this. Turn off here. Hazel rolls her eyes, drives down an exit ramp.  Hank! Okay! The house begins to smoke.  It's verisimilitudinous. I'm thinking of that as a title.  She's not my girlfriend.         Sammy's explaining too much. Feels expository. Needs to be shorthand, like, \"Jeremy big.\" Hazel writes that down. They all continue down the hall.  Sure.  Caden? What do you think?I think we could try it.  Let's try it. Maybe it could happen at the director's table.  Tammy was right. I don't understand why you're with Sammy.  That happened one time! You fucked him?  What do you mean, he's available? Since when are you available?  When? How come you never told me?  Fuck. I have to let the actor who plays Derek go. What is his name?       It's not my response. It just crossed my mind. We have enormous budgetary concerns here.  Stop, okay. Just stop. I don't like Tammy and she's  She looks like you. And --  No she does not. -- and she offered to have  I don't know. Yeah. It was nice.  Ugh. I'm just trying to be honest. It was nice. Not earth- shattering.  No!  Okay, I cried a little before.  Hazel, you've been part of me forever. Don't you know that? I breathe your name in every exhalation.       I don't know. Hazel latches her pinky around Caden's. Sammy has been watching the whole thing from behind a pillar. Caden glances at his watch.  Crap, Ellen's October 23rd scene!  What's going on, Maurice?  Okay. Are we good to go?   Did you hear that?  What?Did we hire an Adele?  This is the wrong key, Sandy.  Adele! Adele, are you in there?  Adele?  Yeah, okay. Can we just get the right key, so we can do the scene? Please, somebody?  Look familiar?  Listen, I built this because I wanted to show you what happened --  No fair, Sammy! She wouldn't see you jump. She never saw me! You're not being authentic.  I know how to do it now. There are nearly thirteen million people in the world. Try to imagine that many people! None of those people is an extra. They're all the leads of their own stories. They have to be given their due.  Do you see what I'm saying? Hazel has her head in her hands. She looks over at Caden, imploringly.  We could get a place together. We could get a loft.  Yeah. I miss Olive. And the other one. The retarded one.  No you're not. I'm a badI am. I should never... have just trying to get to you.  You can't cause someone to kill himself. He was troubled.  My heart aches so much for you.  I'm aching for it being over.  God. You're just perfect.  It doesn't always happen for me now. Because of the medication and everything. I take a lot of pills.   I'm embarrassed. I just want you to know it's not you. And it's not me. It's the medication. They are tender and quiet and intensely focused. The smoke in the room is dense. When it's over, they lie there quietly, with the occasional cough from both of them. Caden cries quietly.  I'm sorry.  I have a title. The Obscure Moon Lighting an Obscure World.          Oh, shut up.She's had a fucked-up life with issues, thanks to you.  You're insane.She's dying, asshole. Is that insane enough for you?  Hello.Hi, Olive. I've missed you so much.  No. I'm sorry.I had hope you have learned. Weakly, Olive points to a headset on her night table. She pantomimes putting it on. Caden puts it on. Olive puts on her own. There follows a slightly delayed and staticky translation, in an accented male voice, of everything Olive says, with a delay between what Caden says and Olive's response, as she listens in translation.  It's Maria. She did this.  Your mother and Maria took you away. I tried for years to find you. I didn't leave you.  What? I'm not a homosexual!  She's lying to you.  Maria is your lover?  You have no idea how evil she is.     Can you ever forgive me?  For abandoning you.  For abandoning you to be have anal sex with my homosexual lover Eric.  My love. I know how to do the play. It'll take place over the course of one day. The day will be the day before you died, the happiest day of my life. I'll be able to relive it forever.  I need a Caden for my Hazel.  Um...       I don't understand him.  Okay. That sounds good.     The title is about a lot of things. You'll see. It's about a lot.  Are you gay, Michael?  Do you know someone named Eric?       Ok, take off the sweater. Tammy takes off the sweater, puts it on the chair back.  Smile shyly at each other. They do. It lingers. Millicent looks over at the funeral scene. It's dull and static.  Millicent. She turns. He waves her over. Tammy sits on the stoop.  That was ... spectacular.  Thanks.I'm out of ideas. I'm dead.  I need to keep my hand in.  Filled? You mean...?     Yes?  Thank you.  Have a very good day.   Eric. Caden looks over. No note from Adele. He gets out of bed, glances in the mirror, seems surprised by his reflection.  Hello. The woman turns. She's middle-aged, face radiating kindness.  Where is everybody?  Would you sit with me for a moment? I'm very tired. And lonely. The woman smiles at Caden. They sit on a log.  I feel like I know you.  Yes! That's it. Yes. You seem a bit older than I remember.  I didn't mean to say you look old.       Everyone's dreams in all those apartments. All those secrets we'll never know. That's the truth of it -- all the thoughts nobody will ever know.  I'm sorry the experiment didn't work. I wanted it to with all my heart. I wanted to do that picnic with my daughter. I feel I've disappointed you terribly.  All I want is someone to see me, someone to look at me with kindness. For me to be the most special person in the world to just one person.  I know what to do with this play now. I have an idea. I think -- The screen goes black fast.",

        "Adele": "Okay!-- in downtown Schenectady -- Adele leaves the kitchen. Caden, also 40, enters as she's leaving. He's dressed in a ratty terrycloth robe.  Morning. Morning. Tried not to wake you.     Caden, could you get that? It's Maria. I don't want to.  Ugh. Caden! (looks at bright green smear on toilet paper That's weird. The phone stops ringing.  No, honey.

Caden is pouring himself a cup of coffee. He sips it and stares out the window. It's raining.  You're kidding! Holy fuck! Caden exits with his coffee, annoyed about the phone call.           All right, baby. See you then. Adele clicks off her cellphone.  Yeah? Huh. Well, he wasOh wait. He won the Nobel old, right?Prize. Good for him.  What?!Do you need to come look at my poop again?!  No, Olive, it's fine. JustWhat if it's alive? What if flush.I kill it? It's green! Like plants!  It's not alive, honey.God, remember that production of The Dumbwaiter I did at Albanyfest? The toilet is flushed.  I have your oatmeal, honey.  Olive, c'mon. You told me I don't want oatmeal. oatmeal. This isn't a restaurant. Adele growls, grabs the oatmeal, dumps it in the sink.  Here. Now you better eat this.          Jesus! Caden! What the fuck -- ?! Olive, in a nightgown, stands quietly in the doorway, her curled toes clenched. She holds a large stuffed owl.  Um. I was shaving and -- My God! Jesus! Look at your head! Dumbly, Caden tries to look up at his forehead, then squints nervously at himself in the mirror.   Honey, don't look. Olive turns around.  Put pressure. Press. Press!  I don't know! Just... both! Caden sits on the toilet, presses a towel to his head. Adele squats, goes into a spasmodic coughing fit, finishes, opens the cabinet under the sink, pushes her arm through bottles of cleaning products, old sponges, old toothbrushes, toilet paper rolls and other junk to the shut-off valves.  I can't turn it! It's gonna flood! Olive hugs the owl tightly and it speaks.  Whooo. Whooo. Whooo areI can't -- Oh wait, got it! you? Adele turns off the water. Olive looks back into the room.     No, it's Friday, honey.  So what exactly did he say?  Constricting.  No. Yes. The bump to the head?  Okay. I got it. Jesus.Sorry. I'm a little anxious.  Caden.  Remind me to call the plumber, would you? I need aI have rehearsal! Fuck! to-do list. Caden!  Not for a long time, honey. Caden pulls out a cell phone and dials.  Remember Dr. Woodman said Dad, what's a plumber? after the last vaccination --  Or woman, Dad.Right. He's the man or woman who fixes sinks and toilets and... do you know what pipes are?  What's wrong, baby?  Capillaries.   What are you doing? Jesus.  Well, stop it.  It's okay, honey.  You don't have to worry, baby. You don't have blood.  Caden, stop it! Olive cries. Adele coughs. Caden stares out the window. It's dark, but his pupils are pinpricks.        That stool in your office?  When I was pregnant with Olive...  Um... I don't know. Hopeful or something. Like something was going to change.  Yes, of course. Yes. I mean... big time.  Maybe not as much as I had hoped. That's a terrible thing to say.  I feel alone sometimes. I feel exhausted. Can I say something awful?  I've fantasized about Caden dying and being able to start again. Guilt free. I know it's terrible.        Um, yeah, I guess. Caden pisses in the sink in the corner of the studio. His urine is amber. He finishes and peeks over Adele's shoulder, through the magnifying glass at the painting. It's an amazingly detailed and angrily colored painting of a woman in a state of profound despair, screaming to the heavens, while standing in a field of flames.  Thanks. How was rehearsal?  It's what you do.  Caden, listen, I'm really sorry. I just can't go tonight.  I'm sorry. I've got to get two canvases ready to ship. By tomorrow. I know it sucks.  But it's opening night.I know.

Adele and Maria laugh.  Jesus, it is late. Early!Can we get a ticket for I'd love to see it, too. Maria? Adele smiles.  A little. I don't know. Y'know? I mean, are you happy with it?

I'm not being like anything. Are you seeing someone else?  Is that your entire frame of reference for relationship problems?  Oh, you're fine.        No, I know. Exactly. Caden picks up the newspaper. It's dated May 25th, 2006. He flips through, finds the obituaries and starts to read.  Ok. All right. Yeah. Ok, bye. Adele hangs up the phone, looks at the paper.  Maria.  Caden, I think I want to go to Berlin with just Olive. Caden looks up.  I think it would be good for us. Silence. Caden's father appears in the doorway.     Caden. I don't know. Y'know? I don't know what I'm doing. It's just a little time apart.  We'll talk when I get back. Everyone is disappointing. The more you know someone. The whole romantic love thing is just projection. Right?

There was a knock at theGod, you're beautiful. door.   It was a bearded old man. Caden can hold out no longer. He kisses her. They fall back on the bed. He kisses her all over as she continues to tell the story. Her voice becomes irresistibly melodious.  He said to me, \"young lady, I have in my satchel a ring. Whomever possesses it will receive all the magic of the woodland sprites.\"   lolling, breathing her\"You can have this ring if in) you promise me one thing.\" I have to fuck you. I have\"Anything,\" I whispered in to. his ear. Caden and Claire are having sex now.  He said, \"There is one more thing. You must never tell anyone what you promised me. If you do, you will die.\"         So I used my new power to kill all the townsfolk. Horrible, humiliating deaths. I was reunited with my family. And I lived happily ever after, doing only good with my new powers. Caden cries and rests his head on her thigh.  Why are you crying, honey?     It's okay. We'll be fine. You're with me now. We'll be good.  I'd like to buy a ticket. Okay. That'll be forty  Okay. Forty dollars it is.Okay. Here's your ticket.     Davis, I'll start with you.

I don't like that guy you got to play you.  I think you need to fire him. Caden hands her a scrap of paper.   Oh, fuck you. I'm forty-five years old. I don't want to do this shit anymore.

Do you know what I've given up for you? For this. For you. For you.       I'm sorry.I -- I thought I wanted to be just a working stage actress.

(back in her book) See you in a few. Yup.  I keep reading the first line. It's a good line, I think. But I don't know much about literature.  I'm trying to better myself, Caden. Recommend me something. You're a genius; you must've read nearly a dozen books.  Um, I've read his name. A lot! I swear!       Okay, not his entire name. Heinz?  If you say so, I will. Can't wait till Wednesday. I'm so excited to see it.  It's pretty impossible that I won't, you know. I mean... She trails off, shrugs. They smile at each other. Caden exits. Hazel looks at her book, re-reads the first sentence.  The car crash?  Sorry. So I'm reading The Trial.  Love. I'm such an idiot for not knowing about this book.  It's famous, it turns out.  Then you say, in fact, you're very bright, Hazel. And I love your eyes.  In fact, you're very bright, Hazel. And I love your eyes. Oh, am I? Oh, do you? Oh, darling!  I can't say what then you say.  Cause it's dirty. A whistling noise turns their heads. In the distance a man with an unopened parachute is plummeting.  Oh my God! Jesus! They watch as the man falls behind a building. A scream. A screech of brakes.  He's gotta be dead. Right?  I figured I'd better get in fast.  I loved it! And, by the way, Claire is trouble. And not terribly bright. Caden laughs.  Just wanted you to know the word on the street.       Are you kidding? I cried for like fifteen minutes after. I loved every minute of it. Except Claire. I thought she was weak.  Oh, Caden, not you, too. What I want to know is why she started crying in her last monologue, right after she had the line, 'I can't cry for you Willy...'?  Where's el wife-o?  Ah.  Ah.  Hooray! We've still got it!  I'll miss you.  You're going to miss you? Yeah, that's it.             You want to now? With me. In my car.  I don't know.Come on, it's a party.  What does something mean?  I don't know. Bothered?What does bothered mean?  And me with a station wagon and all. Could be dangerous.  You're absolutely zero fun.  Jesus, I like you. I'm going.  I know it's brilliant. I don't need some dope with elbow patches telling me. She smiles, gives him a hug, and heads toward the door.     You're not going to make it, baby.     I've always loved this house.  Yes. It's a wonderful place.The truth is, I never really imagined I could afford it.  It's a scary decision. I never thought I'd buy a house alone. But, y'know, I'm 36, and I wonder what I'm really waiting for.  Home-buying is always scary.But I mean with the fire and all especially.  I don't know. I'm thinking IIt's a perfect size for should go.someone alone.  I like it, I do. But I'm really concerned about dying in the fire.  We should get a drink. Be fun.  I like weird. I like you. See? He doesn't say anything.  Anyway. I don't want to make you uncomfortable. I just thought it would be a fun diversion. Okay, I do want to make you uncomfortable.  You can, Cade. You can!       Crease.  It's just a word. Don't get all bent out of shape. Jeez.  God, I'm delighted. Thought you'd never ask. You did ask, right?  Who does?  You don't look like you feel well.  You want to tell me about it?  Ok. Tell me something else.  Um, I bought this really nifty sweater today. On sale. Fifty dollars reduced from three hundred!  It's beautiful.It's cashmere. So very soft. You must feel it. Hazel holds her arm out. Caden touches it.  I don't know. We fuck? We continue to sort of flirt? You divorce your wife and marry me and I make you happy for the very first time in your life and all your symptoms disappear?  We call it a day?  Don't choose the last one. I just said that one for effect.  No, I suppose not. Choosing is not your strong suit. You want to come over to my place, Cotard?  Um ... I'm won't let you off the this time.  She hasn't called you since she left. You've left countless messages. It's been a year.        I'm going to buy you a calendar. Caden rips a cocktail napkin into little pieces.  Scraps for my scrapbook. Caden watches her ass as she turns to leave.     Caden's mysterious condition. Well, have one sip, anyway.  Would you like me to have? A little love potion, perhaps?  If that's what it takes, consider it done. Poof! Love potion number 69.       Does it make you want to kiss me?  Tell me why?  Hmm. Beg a girl, why dontcha.  Um, okay. Please, Hazel, let On your knees. me --  I'd like you to beg me on your knees for a kiss. Just for fun. Dumbly, Caden gets down on his knees.   For fun, baby.  Oh, kiddo, you don't even know.  You have me. And I adore you.      What? What is it?  I don't know. I'm sorry. What?  Oh, Jesus. Oh, fuck me.I'm sorry. It's terrible, I  Yeah. I just thought this might change things. I hoped. Ugh.  That is just the wrong thing to say right now, Caden. You should go.  Be quiet, Squishy.Hi.  Caden, I won't be yet another woman you feel guilty about.       Here. Take this. I got like five for Christmas. Goddamn Christmas. She hands him a 2009 calendar. It features photos of Adele.  Huh. Pause.  What are you doing?  Huh.  In your box office?  I'm not sure I can work with you, Caden. I'm kind of angry.  It's really disturbing.  It's Hazel. Leave a message or don't. Your dime.       I'm just asking. Stop!  You are so obnoxious!  Yeah, well, you find it awfully charming. My obnoxiousity.  You don't want to cross me.  No. Because you like me so much.  And my use of the word \"obnoxiousity.\"  Yes. You're delicious in your acquiescence. Claire enters, looks for Caden. She spots Hazel first.  Hi, Claire.  Hazel.  Yes, I'm the box office.  Wonderful! You?  Yes, I recall Mr. Cotard. Hazel looks around now, too. Both spot Caden at the same time. He smiles and waves and approaches.  Hi, Caden. Hi, Caden.  This is Derek.  Hi, Derek.  Great, Cade. En.  Yes.  So --We'll leave you be.  Yeah, okay. Thanks. Derek and I --  No, of course. It was nice Take care. seeing you. Caden and Claire go to Caden's booth.

Hazel...I'm asking you a question. Did you have sex with her now that you're back together?  I have to go. I'm sorry about your dad. That's awful news.  I have to. I'm going out. I have to get ready. Everything's fine.  Caden, what are you doing Sorry. Can I talk to you? here? Please? Hazel kisses Derek, whispers something in his ear. They share a giggle. Derek waves at Caden and heads into the burning house. Hazel approaches Caden's car.  Caden, everyone has to figure I want you to look at me like out their own life. Y'know? you used to.  Oh, honey, I can't anymore.  It's okay. I'm okay.  I'll always be your friend. I'll help you through any way I can.  Caden, I'm fine. I have Derek.     They fired me. I caused an outbreak of conjunctivitis. I didn't wash my hands. I had pink eye hands! Pink hands!  I didn't wash my hands! I'm a stupid cow! I don't have anything to show for being on this planet. And this fucking private Christian school is killing us. It's not cheap. It's Derek's thing. I don't believe in that shit. Y'know? Try to be a good person. That's all there is. I'm sorry. I'm talking too much. Do you have anything for me, Caden?       Um, I have an assistant,Please, Caden. Everything is Hazel. And there's no box falling apart. I miss you. office yet. There are problems at home. I'm worthless. I'm fat. What am I going to do? Nobody laughs at my jokes the way you did.  Sammy Barnathan? Sammy Barnathan stands. He is the gaunt man we've seen following Caden. Hazel leads him to Caden. Caden stands.  This is Sammy Barnathan.I don't have a resume or picture. I've never worked as an actor.  He's good, Caden.  I only have eyes for you, dear.  I get to be a character? Hooray!  Already put out a call for a Claire replacement. Would you really clean my bathroom?  God, Caden, it's all so fucked.  Yup. June 9th? Caden nods, rushes out the door of the warehouse set.  Eh. Caden this is Millicent Weems.  That's what I tried to tellAw, no harm, no foul, Caden. him! It's Equity break anyway.  Ten minutes, everybody! The actors playing the people on the street immediately stop what they're doing. Actors pour from apartment buildings and shops, lighting cigarettes and talking on cell phones. Sammy goes off.  Hazel. What?  Kind of. He reminds me of you.  Don't worry, Caden. I like you more. I do. Sammy's just fun.  Oh, sweetie. No, you're not. Caden's cell phone rings. He answers it.     In my car. Heading to dinner with Sammy.  Caden. I don't want to say things that are going to make you sad.  You want me to be sad that someone's taking me out to dinner? I don't know how to do that.  It just happened, Caden. I didn't plan it. You were with Claire. This probably isn't going to go anywhere, sweetie. I'm still your girl.  Oh, Haze. C'mon. It's just dinner. He's got  Caden, I know everything about you and it's all adorable. I love you and I always will. So don't worry. I gotta go, I'm there. Hazel hangs up. Caden stands there for a minute.      Is there no end to your pussy kissing?  Whatever. I've got work to do. Tell your girlfriend to get out here if she wants a ride back.  Give it a rest, Caden. I can smell her on your breath.  That didn't happen, Caden.  But Hazel hasn't done it, Tammy.       Great!Fuck. I'm going out for a smoke. They watch her go. Caden turns back to the others.  He's nice. He's available. He fucks me without crying.  Yes! And you and I only fucked one time that's why you only cried one time! I give you endless opportunities.  Derek left. Because of you!  I don't know, Caden. How come a lot of things? It's not like we can start fresh, like Sammy and I can. There's all this pressure on us. We're finally both free and there's all this fucking pressure.       That's such a romantic response. I'm touched.  Ugh. Forget it.  Derek is played by Joe --  Stop, okay. Just stop. I don't like Tammy and she's  No she does not. -- and she offered to have  Yes. Was it good?  Ugh. I'm just trying to be honest. It was nice. Not earth- shattering.  Did you cry?  You're making progress.     Ã¢â¬ÅWhat?Ã¢â¬Â  What?Did we hire an Adele?  IÃ¢â¬â¢m sure I wouldÃ¢â¬â¢ve remembered that. No. The shower turns on. Caden grabs the key from Millicent.  Caden, there's no one in there. You've got to let go of her. She's not here anymore. I'm here.       Yeah, we'll get the right key.  Oh my God! It's an exact replica of the Tethered Maiden Terrace! Derek and the kids and I had so much fun on that trip!  There's nothing to talk Oh fuck! Sammy, Just stay about, Hazel! This is not right where you are! I'myour fault! coming up!  Come over tonight? Please?  God, Caden, that sounds nice. I miss my daughter. Maybe she could come live with us.  I'm a bad person.       No you're not. I'm a badI am. I should never... have just trying to get to you.  I'm so ashamed of myself. Caden walks over to her and touches her shoulder.  Oh, Caden. I wish we had this when we were young. And all the years in between. So many years, so fast.  What did we do? Caden kisses Hazel's forehead. She coughs and smiles up at him, then cranes her neck and kisses him on the lips.  We're here, Caden. I'm here.  Yeah. The end is built in to the beginning. What can you do?  I'm a mess. But we fit, don't we. They kiss, then Hazel climbs into bed.  I don't care. It's okay.       It's okay. It's different crying this time. I can tell. I'm crying, too. And I cried last time. After you left. I never told you. But I cried, too. Caden kisses her again.  I think it might be too much.  It's Hazel. Leave a message or don't. Your dime.",
        "Sammy": "This is Sammy Barnathan.I don't have a resume or picture. I've never worked as an actor.  I've been following you for twenty years. So I knew about this audition. Because I follow you. Caden, hiding is nervousness, nods.  I've learned everything about you by following you. Hire me and you will see who you truly are. Caden stares at Sammy. Sammy stares back. There's fear in Caden's eyes but he doesn't drop his gaze.  Peek-a-boo. Sammy transforms effortlessly into Caden.       Okay, Hazel, I don't think we need to talk to anyone else. This guy has me down. I'm going to cast him right now. Then maybe you and I can get a drink and we can try to figure out this thing between us. Why I cried. I've never felt about anyone the way I feel about you. I want to fuck you until we merge into a Chimera.        A mythical beast with penis and vagina eternally fused, two pair of eyes that look only at each other, lips ever touching and one voice that whispers to itself.  I've never seen your shit gray.  I know it's pill time. You don't need to hide from me. Caden opens his pack and pulls out a baggie full of pills. He takes them, one-by-one. Sammy watches and counts. When it's over, he speaks.  You're missing your Fosonex.       No. Check your bag. Caden pulls out books and notebooks and a sweater. The pill falls out of the sweater onto the grimy floor.  Fosonex, 2.5 mg. Caden picks the pill up off the floor. It's got grime on it.  Swallow it anyway. It's important. Go on, sweetie. Caden looks at Sammy and swallows the pill.  Good boy.  No, thanks.No, thanks, Claire.  It'd be my honor to play your husband, Claire. You're an amazing actress. I saw you in Bernarda Alba last year at The Roundabout.  Start, huh? Caden chuckles.     Amazing artist though. The best living artist. There's no one who stares the truth in the face like she does. A sweet pussy, too. Caden looks at Sammy, confused.  Oh. I read it.  Maybe she's got a sublet in New York. Maybe the Met's doing a retrospective. Maybe, baby. He hands Caden a slip of paper.  I want to follow you there and see how you lose even more of yourself. Research. For the part. Partner.      You don't like Sammy? Why? I think he's good.  I'm not firing him, Claire. He's the best thing in the show. Next to you.  He's your husband. Claire turns to the real Caden and screams.  Good, Jimmy!  Caden, time out?  What's up? I feel we need a Hazel in here. There's a whole side of Caden I'm not able to explore without a Hazel. Caden looks over at Hazel. Claire watches Caden from the street corner.  I've been going to Adele's place. And cleaning it. Long pause. Caden rubs his eyes.  I'm sorry.I -- I thought I wanted to be just a working stage actress. But, y'know, I'm watching all the young girls crowding me out and it's -- There's a knock on the door. Sammy just stands there.  What's going on, Hazel?  Oh, good. That's good.That's all we need around here, two Hazels.  Maybe I will.  Claire, no.  Morning, Haze.  Okay. Yours?   Sorry. Everybody here?   Sammy likes you. Caden looks at Hazel. She nods.  Hazel, could you get everyone situated? I need to speak to Will about some new sets. Sammy pulls some Polaroids out of his backpack.  Hi, Caden. I'm being you. You like Hazel; I like Hazel.  Jeremy is playing to us. Tell him he simply needs to talk to Donna. We'll hear what we hear. Tammy takes down the note.     There's nothing to talk Oh fuck! Sammy, Just stay about, Hazel! This is not right where you are! I'myour fault! coming up!  This is where we part ways. This is authentic. This is what the real Caden would do. This is what real love looks like. Sammy leaps. The actors below scatter. Sammy hits hard, breaks through the fake cement, and is dead. Blood everywhere.",

I said nothing happened. Didn't you hear me?  I'm tired to death. I couldn't make it. I just couldn't make it, Linda.  I got as far as a little above Yonkers. I stopped for a cup of coffee... maybe it was the coffee.       I suddenly couldn't drive any more. The car kept going off onto the shoulder, y'know? The audience is rapt. Caden relaxes.

    "description": "Theater director Caden Cotard is mounting a new play. Fresh off of a successful production of Death of a aa/2Salesman, he has traded in the suburban blue-hairs and regional theater of Schenectady for the cultured audiences and bright footlights of Broadway. Armed with a MacArthur grant and determined to create a piece of brutal realism and honesty, something into which he can put his whole self, he gathers an ensemble cast into a warehouse in Manhattan's theater district. He directs them in a celebration of the mundane, instructing each to live out their constructed lives in a small mock-up of the city outside. As the city inside the warehouse grows, Caden's own life veers wildly off the tracks. The shadow of his ex-wife Adele, a celebrated painter who left him years ago for Germany's art scene, sneers at him from every corner. Somewhere in Berlin, his daughter Olive is growing up under the questionable guidance of Adele's friend, Maria. He's helplessly driving his marriage to actress Claire into the ground. Sammy Barnathan, the actor Caden has hired to play himself within the play, is a bit too perfect for the part, and is making it difficult for Caden to revive his relationship with the alluringly candid Hazel. Meanwhile, his therapist, Madeline Gravis, is better at plugging her best-seller than she is at counselling him. His second daughter, Ariel, is disabled. And a mysterious condition is systematically shutting down each of his autonomic functions, one by one. As the years rapidly pass, Caden buries himself deeper into his masterpiece. Populating the cast and crew with doppelgangers, he steadily blurs the line between the world of the play and that of his own deteriorating reality. As he pushes the limits of his relationships, both personally and professionally, a change in creative direction arrives in Millicent Weems, a celebrated theater actress who may offer Caden the break he needs.",
