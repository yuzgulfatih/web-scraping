        "Ed": "Against the wall! Hands up! Get up! Dillinger's cuffs fell away. Now his Thompson covers the stunned pokerÂ°players. Hamilton and Dillinger are as tight as they come.- They share their food, money, liquor, ammunition and women. ,.id right now...  This Guard gives Shouse an insolent look. Shouse slams the Guard's head with a length of steel pipe. Guard goes down. Shouse goes wild and continues to hammer his skull again and again, caving it in.          Its Miss. She's my daughter, Viola. That'll be eight dollars. Viola retrieves her toddler brother who's crawled into the Pontiac. Dellinger peels off a $20 bill.  Can't change that...             John Dillinger seems like a romantic husband with his little wife Betty. And it feels a little out of place...         walks fast through the corridor of congressmen. He talks over his left shoulder to Suydam and Tolson. They struggle to hear him...      Grover stands and flattens against the back wall, as if trying to permeate the masonry and disappear into the back alley. Dillinger peels him off the wall and steers him towards the vault.            Three hostages jump off. Dillinger pulls Anna Patzke and Weyland inside.              They look into each other's eyes. He pulls her closer, wants to kiss her long smooth neck. He almost can't resist... Their lips are an inch apart. And then she rests her cheek on his shoulder and the kiss that wasn't hangs in the air around them. He whispers...    Billie stares at him, ignoring her menu.        TWO MEN approach. Billie checks their hats and coats. To Dillinger...    He goes into a closet to get two Marshall Fields boxes and two drinks.           She gets up and wanders around the room. He thinks she's the most beautiful creature he's ever seen. She's looking at his stuff. She sees suitcases that are packed, ready to leave in a heartbeat. Everything's so neat. She touches his folded shirt...  She turns over and puts her mouth next to his ear. It gets amorous through...         He herds the tellers over. Pierpont makes customers sit in chairs. The vault door is already open...          Winstead gestures at their bags and one case. The PORTER goes to lift the case. It is so heavy he can barely raise it. Campbell picks up the other end. They toss it on the cartâ        She hikes up her skirt and sits on his lap and smothers him with a kiss. Her hat falls off. Patrons nearby glance and look away. Dillinger doesn't give a damn. A new pack of dogs are about to take flight.                             Dellinger grabs him by the shirt, spins him round and jams it under his chin.  Youngblood shoves the Thompson out the window and fires some rounds. Meanwhile, Dillinger floors it, The V-8 roars, rockets them ahead.              front sight rests on Zarkovich's heart which he would blow out the back of his chest with the souped-up 351 Winchester. Now, Dillinger pulls the '34 Ford out of the backyard with Red still on the running board. Zarkovich almost faints in relief.          come forward to frisk Johnny + Red. They gesture for them to open their coats to allow the search.    D'Andrea pulls out piece of paper and a pen. Dillinger looks at him like he's crazy. Then he signs the autograph.    cuts to photograph of...      walk up the aisle to CAMERA. Cartoons continue behind them.    He squeezes off a ROUND. The shot hits Dillinger in the back of the left shoulder and exits his upper arm.    Rorer hovers over Tommy Carroll. He blocks our view but his hands press down onto Carroll's skull. Screaming. The Doctor walks away. He will not be a witness to torture. More screaming. CLOSE ON PURVIS: looks up to see Rorer looking at him. Rorer is sweating. He nods. He has an answer.  Dillinger positions a Thompson on the window sill. Then he turns on the radio and tries to sleep.  in a burst of speed, cover behind heavier trees, which are cratered by the heavy shot.

He was there. It got cold. He bought a coat. Therefore, he may have been harbored or have a safe house nearby.       24.  By such techniques we will get Dillinger.  Doris...  For those of you who haven't met her, Miss Rogers is my secretary...  Please contact the Chicago telephone exchange supervisors. Request appointments for Carter Baum or myself.  We are going to be working long hours. It will be dangerous. Those of you who aren't prepared for that, can go. And if you're going to go, go now.  Thank you, gentlemen.           How did we find Berman?     Let's go. Right now. They race out.     40.     Blocking vehicles? End of this street? Alley? They aren't \"deployed.\" They're merely \"here\". Cowley gets it.

The man we let get away wasn't John Dillinger.  It was Baby Face Nelson.      Yes, it was. I take full responsibility, sir. Hoover calms for a moment.  And I'd like to request we hire part time agents with \"special qualifications\"... from outside the Bureau.  The Bureau has used these men before.  Our \"type\" cannot get the job done...

We SEE Winstead and Hurt in their suits and ties are there, too. They lounge at ease. A Tucson Deputy gives them coffee. Eye contact with Dillinger. But Dillinger reacts to Purvis.  What keeps you up, nights, Mr. Dillinger? Now Dillinger reads him like an X-ray.  Goodbye, Mr. Dillinger.             With Baum.  She knows we're watching and he knows we're listening.     Hamilton's family hasn't had word from him in years ...  Uncomfortable, Purvis stands apart from the others. Agents Rorer and Clegg are by the bedside.  Not yet. If you interfere, I'll arrest you. From inside.  Our group will fly down in the plane.  Sam, you drive up.  If you can get Dillinger alive, do it. If not, then you put him down. Rice, Rorer - take the back. Carter, you cut through the woods and come up on the front from the northwest. Get up close enough to see if they're in the barroom.  We know where he is. We go in.  o in anyway.

Agents Madala, and Clegg FIRE as well.  Where the hell is Cowley? Purvis - low - runs to the Chevrolet, opens the door. The driver and one passenger are dead. A middle aged, unarmed man steps out. Bullets zing around him. He promptly sits down on the ground.,, dead drunk. These are not Public Enemies.  Is it Dillinger?  See if you can head him off. Go! Purvis runs into the woods after the fleeing figure. Carter Baum races off in a car.     84.           Who was it? Was it Dellinger? Baum shakes his head a fraction.     running towards them, jumps in the Packard.  Turn it around! .the car...        `'aster, Sam!     are out. Purvis FIRES.

Is it the Marbro or the Biograph? We will be deployed at both. Whichever one he shows at, I will be outside that theater when Dillinger exits. I will give the signal to move in by lighting a cigar.

One thing I learned was that John Dillinger was an outlaw and my Adversary. But he was no punk. And he was no hoodlum.  Another is that I have no future in your Bureau. And I don't desire one.

Freddie and Dock Barker are the sons of Ma Barker. After the FBI gunned down the old woman, Hoover labeled her the \"crime genius\" of the family. According to Volney Davis, she couldn't organize breakfast.      25.  Don't like kidnapping.  The public don't like kidnappers.  I do. I hide out among them.  .: yeah, then you, Ma, Dock and Freddie hole up like hermits on farms for six months. I grew up on a goddamn farm. I hate farms. I like big cities, crowds and a good time...  Say, by the way, if someone got pinched here, who can get'em out real fast?  What about this train?..     Where you gonna go?  Were having too good a time today. We ain't worryin' about tomorrow yet...  Keep me in mind on the train. Karpis leaves. Dellinger can't see Billie anymore.  Homer stayin' steady?  Three rules I learned from Walter Dietrich. One: never work with people who are desperate. Two: never work with people who aren't the best. Three: never work when you're not ready. Billie reappears, dancing with a young man.  Without women, I might as well have `stayed in stir. Anna Sage approaches with a young girl for Red.  I don't know what you said to your friend, but I sure am glad you did. Billie looks him over: a well-made man in a good suit with a great smile. And, paradoxes: he easily talks to women but he's not a hustler. He's young, but there's a world of experience in his face. Open, but he's holding something back.      28.  What's your name?  Buy you a drink? Billie looks at her girlfriend, she nods, Billie rises... As they cross to the bar.  Is that French?  Jack Harris. Music changes to \"Bye Bye Blackbird.\"  I don't know how. She smiles a pretty smile at him.  My, but you are pretty.      29.  Where you from, Billie? She turns her right ear towards him. She's deaf in her left ear.  Where's Flandreau.?  Father's French, what's on the other side?  From South Dakota, Indian's likelier than Italian. She looks at him.  I'm not most men.  I'm catching up.      30.  On life, meeting someone like you.  Dark, beautiful, like the black bird in that song... She laughs at the flattery. Holds his eyes a beat with an ironic look. A couple from another group looks at Dillinger. He's cool. He returns the look. They look away.  Say, how'd you like some dinner?     What are you gonna have?      31.  Well...I rob banks. Then he leans back in his chair and regards her.  That's where all these people here put their money.  'Cause I can't lie to you. she studies him carefully.  I feel like I know you.  Some of the places I been ain't so hot. Where I'm going is a lot better. Wanna come along?  If you were looking at what I am looking at, honey, you'd be in a hurry too. She laughs at his flattery, which she is also finding persuasive.      32.  That's 'cause you're beautiful. A blonde woman, elegant and ice cold, stares at Billie, a Depression-era child in her dress.   Listen, doll, that's 'cause they're all about where people come from. Only thing important is where somebody's going.  To the top. He's irresistible.  Let's get out of here. Beat. She nods. They get up, get their things. On their way...a man intercepts Dillinger. He is GILBERT CATENA , solid with big hands. He's smiling.   Go wait outside. I'll be right there. Billie turns and walks out of the restaurant.  How you been, Gil?      33.  Looks like a barber.  See you. Gilbert...           No, honey. You go get your coat. She looks up. So does May. May flashes Billie a look: if you don't want him, I do.  You ran out on me.  I 'you're going to be my girl, you have swear you'll never do that again.  I'm waiting.   \"I am not ever going to run out on you again.\" Say it.      36.  Well, I will never run out on you. And that's a promise.  Keep the tip.  You ain't getting other people's hats and coats no more either. He takes her coat and holds it for her. She doesn't move.  You're with me now.  I was raised on a farm in Mooresville, Indiana. My ma died when I was three. My daddy beat the hell out of me because he didn't know no better way to raise me. I used to do dumb things but I'm a lot smarter now. I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars, and you. What else do you need to know? She gets into her coat. Dillinger opens the door for her. They exit, watched by May.  enters. It's large, low-ceilinged, luxurious and modern --- Billie is bowled over. He sits her down on a sofa.      37.  Yeah. Since yesterday. From a back bedroom  a phonograph is louder as a door opens and Red enters the kitchen in a robe for a drink. He returns. Laughter. Dillinger has the boxes and drinks.  I got something for you.  What's wrong? Open it up. Billie opens the boxes. She lifts out a sleeveless dress in dusty pink. It is beautiful. She is very touched. The second has a coat with a fur color. But still...  We`rob banks `cause banks is where they keep the money. I can make 500 dollars in a year or I can make ten thousand dollars in a morning. I'll take my chances on the bank. No apologies. We don't go lookin' to hurt anybody. But if somebody gets in our way, that's gotta be their problem. That what you want to know?  You want to get to know me?           Egyptian cotton. Since we been out I go for the finest stuff. As much as I can get, as fast we can get it.  Nowhere. What do you mean?  Always are. Ready to get up and go in a heartbeat... She stands next to him in the bed now. He pulls her down next to him.. She turns her good ear towards him.  What's wrong with the other ear?  Where's he now?  A criminal mastermind...      39.  Well baby-you're going to start a new and exciting kind of life from right now. And as they're pulled to each other and start making love again, she stops...  To please you. That's not what she meant, but gently, he rolls her over on the bed. A smile spreads slowly across her lips.  vaults the five foot divider railing and trains two 45s on  Get over to the vault! Everybody! Go on!      45.   Well drive out separately.       49.  Billie and I want to hit the Gulf Coast on the way to Arizona.  Well be there.  What? She is quiet for a moment.  You going somewhere, doll, am I?      50.  You want to leave?  Well, I don't want you to leave. So it won't be that way.  Who the hell gave you a crystal ball?!  Homer what...?  I am not going anywhere! I am going to die in your arms as an old man when that time comes. So what do you say about that?  ., â¢ ng.  That would be swell. Some friends of mine should be here already. J.C. Davies and Mr. Long?  You want company?      52.  First time you ever put me off. You getting tired of me?  Get dressed. Right now. He turns and runs into...     What happened?   Where they taking you?  Where's Billie...? Thenthey're gone. They now move Dillinger through.         Now these Arizona boys, here?       54.     Sorry about that fellow Barton.. .one who got killed at the Sherone Apartments. Is he getting to Purvis?  Newspaper said you found him alive. It's the eyes, ain't it? They look at you right before they go. Then they drift into nothing. Keep you up nights.   You act like a confident man, Purvis. Bu _, I don't see it. You know a few things. You're probably okay when there's a groupÂ° of you got the other guy outnumbered. But death and mayhem up close? I am used to that and you are not, are you? When it's toe to toe, \"One of us will die right here, right now,\" I don't think you got the get up and go. Purvis has nothing to say. He stares at Dillinger. Then he turns to leave.  I'll see you down the road. From ten feet away.  Oh, yeah? We will see about that.  Go get yourself another line of work, Melvin. Purvis gestures for the guards to let him out -- Dillinger lays back down on his cot. The Tucson Deputies stare after Purvis, one laughs. After a moment...   I was joking about the \"we'll see about that.\" I'll let you boys keep me in this jail awhile.  `Where to?  why? I have absolutely nothing I want to do in Indiana.  FLASHBULBS POP. Lake County, Indiana PROSECUTOR ROBERT ESTILL puts Dillinger's jacket over him to guard against the cold. Two huge Chicago cops put Dillinger into the back of a car. With outrider motorcycles, the caravan takes off out of the airport into the snowy night.     56.  About as glad as Indiana is to see me. Everybody laughs.     Ten years ago. I was a boy and foolish. I held up a grocery store which I never shoulda done cause Mr. Morgan was a good man. And they sentenced me to 10 years in the state penitentiary for a 50 dollar theft. In prison, I met a lot of good -t las. I helped fix up the break at \"f chigan City. Why not? I stick to my friends and they stick to me.  SEE him work the reporters. He knows that they are sympathetic. He plays them like a champ. The New York Times called this moment... \"a modern version of the return of the prodigal son.\"  One minute and 40 seconds flat. Dillinger nods and turns away. He - not the Sheriff - ends the press conference.  You come highly recommended by Alvin Karpis. What can you do for me?  The electric chair. There's none of Dil linger's cocky joie de vivre. Thaw-'s for reporters.  Atta boy, counsel.  -Cpme on, Sam, we're going places. A hulking black prisoner, HERBERT YOUNGBLOOD, holding a length of ipe, materializes next to Dellinger and ushers Bryant and the Trustees into an empty cell. Youngblood pulls the lever, locking the cells.  Boys, get in there. Dillinger, Youngblood and Cahoon set off down the corridor.     Call the warden.  Anything you say.      62.  No one move or I'll plug the warden. Dillinger grabs two Tommy guns. Youngblood starts tying up their prisoners. Baker stares at Dillinger's pistol.  Alright, which of these here cars is the fastest, and you're going with, so don't... lie.  We're taking that.   Wow. Mr. Youngblood, are we clear now?  okay, folks. Dillinger checks his rearview mirror, then the speedometer. He's impressed.   I'm going to write to Henry Ford. \"Dear Henry Ford, Your 1934 Ford is the best damned getaway car in America. Yours -truly, John Dillinger.\"  Relax folks... Dillinger ajoys the speed. He starts to hum. Then...  Okay. Who knows The Last Round-up?\"  \"Get along little doggie, get along..\"  watches cars, people, then.   It's me, Baby.  I can't talk long. Are you okay?  I promised I'd look after you, didn't I?     65.  Intercut Dillinger and Billie.  And you believe me, don't you? You know I will look after you.  Say it. Say you know it.  Say it.  love you, Baby. Dillinger ends the call. Hamilton waits in a Hudson at the curb.            Hiya Sport.  Where's Carole?  Says who?  I don't get it.  About what?      67.  on the bel,:, ,A worn-looking woman answers. She is HARRIET  We're looking for Oscar...is he home?  I sure am sorry, ma'am. Was it an. accident?  Oscar had \"tools\" of mine, he was repairing them.      68.  I went to East Chicago to lay low. The welcome mat was not out. And I kept hearing your name.  Then at Oscar's, my gear is gone. The deadly look in Dillinger's eyes leaves no mistake.  I am going to ask you once.  And I just did.     Wanna know if we're armed? Were armed. He dumps this guy on his ass, his heavy shoe an ounce from crushing his larynx. Red's two Thompsons concealed on shoulder straps are out from under his coat. Frozen time. Phil D'Andrea sits on the corner of a table. Only he stays relaxed.  A`lot of telephones.  But they won't.  I'm popular.  cross through.  I don't know.          Red told you. After we take the bank, we bust out Pierpont and Makley.      74.  The men freeze.  The exposure is so outrageous it makes Dillinger laugh out loud. That makes the people all around talk and joke.  grips his45. Shouse is grey with fear. Houselights darken. Finally, Looney Tunes starts. Daffy Duck.  Where's the bank?  walk up the aisle to CAMERA. Cartoons continue behind them.  Walter forgot ...when you're desperate, 'f iat's when you got no choice.   You're turning it into a circus! What the hell are you doing? Meanwhile, a terrified CLERK presses a button and the alarm rings loudly outside.  Where in the hell's all the big money?  can't believe this is fucking HAPPENING. EXT. THE SECURITY NATIONAL BANK &amp; TRUST COMPANY Dillinger and Hamilton emerge with the Bank President, FOUR TELLERS for a scrum of hostages. Carroll and Nelson,,:.,have a ragtag bunch. They're almost at the car. Nelson turns to the onlookers.          Son of a bitch!  m.on! Shouse cant find his place on the.git.     How'd you find this place? Dillinger looks at Wanetka. He's uneasy. He trusts nothing about it.      78.     How much? Nobody wants to answer. Hamilton meanwhile uses Atropine sulphate to clean Dillinger's wound.  That would be less than $800,000, right? Right!  Leave my money and get out. Van Meter, Nelson and Shouse exit.  We gotta cut loose from Nelson.  No. We don't get out of here in the morning, we're going to wind up dead.  I need two more guns, Red. OVER we HEAR the SOUND OF SOMEONE SCREAMING and CALLING OUT --     79.        running but impeded by his shoulder wound. Hamilton helps him. In the background, we SEE Van Meter and Shouse have also bailed out of the house for the beach but disappear into woods to the RIGHT.  run along the line of the lake, but in woods now.  move fast. Not much brush to slow them. Dillinger senses, reacts...  in a burst of speed, cover behind heavier trees, which are cratered by the heavy shot. And Dillinger, never stopping, out the other side, is FIRING his Thompson at Winstead as.  FIRES -- whrthe bank's cut by a ravine - exactly where Winstead should be...  Winstead's gone. And Dillinger knows the level of play has been raised by the addition of whoever these men are. As he and Red race across the ravine for the high ground advantage...  You hit, Red?  Come on, Red. We can make it.      86.  Gimme the keys to that car! He tosses them. Dellinger already has Red inside, starts it and blastsr,...away from the house. Winstead cjim:bing out of the ravine SEES the car pulling away. It's gone. He and Hurt run for the shoreline to get back to...     Bullshit.  I'm sorry to do this to you, Red. Dillinger empties boxes of lye bought from the pharmacy on Red's face and starts shovelling earth on his friend's body.     92.     Impassive. He knows exactly who they are. He cruises past without glancing and continues west...  opens the door. She jumps in. He's already pulling away...        Happy New Year, doll.  For how long?      97.  Next week? Next year? Alvin said this wasn't gonna last. He was right. The world has turned. Everything's different.  And there's a sweet score. Enough money to go away and stay away for a long time.  So whattya say we lit out of here? Lit out of here, altogether.  Too close. How about we fly to Caracas and then to Rio on Pan Am. Then an oanliner to Manila or Singapore. We are f6reign-looking to them. So they will ,have no idea who the hell we are. We can go out dancing all night and have a lotta laughs anytime we want...     sits in plain view on a chair. His Thompson rests against the wall. His sister, Audrey, is giving him a haircut. His father, John Wilson Dillinger, drinks coffee next to him. The January sunlight is so direct, it's like Spring.  Not too short on the sides.  Of course.  You got an eye on those federal boys?        :Eartender's name is Larry Streng.  Oakley and Potomac. He'll give you the keys. They drive north over the Clark Street Bridge. Dillinger gives her an envelope.  5,000 dollars. It buys us a month, but  watching the distant front of the tavern into which Billie disappeared. Then...        20-30 men surround her.  can do nothing. Tears of frustrated rage stream down his face. Later, he would say he \"cried like a baby.\"     101.     $5,000. You run her down.  Lake County jail or Cook County? I want layouts, blueprints. You visit her. Tell her I'm coming for her. I'll get her out.  I'm fine. I got a place.  Why Tuesday?   What do you figure?  Thanks.  You were in a minority.  Yeah? Louis Piquett arrives and Dillinger interrupts..  You see her? She okay?  Reminded who?      110.  Well, I can. We do this Tuesday, I'm gone on Wednesday.  For me, it's maybe Mexico. And that's the answer. Dillinger plans to score the train. Go to Mexico. Wait for Billie.  looks through the apartment like he always does. He goes to the sink and starts running cold. water on his wrists to cool down.  Tell you what, doll. You and Polly and me, we'll go out to a movie tonight and get in the refrigeration. POLLY HAMILTON enters from a bedroom down the hall, dressed to go out.        Marbro or the Biograph...  Where you goin'?  I'll take you. Its too hot in here.           I'll go in with you.     \"Licenses Examination\" is on the 8th Floor. \"Detective  Here, in the belly of the beast. The lopsided grin behind the dark glasses over the moustache...  How long will you be?  I'll meet you back here... He waits as she boards an elevator. As her doors close, Dillinger follows a group of police, bail bondsmen, and civilian workers into a second elevator.               brushes under his jacket his .45, checking..  You pass?        laughs out loud. The irony is that the gangster who inspired this Hollywood moment is sitting right here watching this movie.  mesmerized' her eyes and soft skin. We SEE in his hyper reality thee satin tones on the screen. Myrna Loy's insouciance,;like Billies, speaks to him. Meanwhile...  the actual Public Enemy #1 watches the celluloid gangster walk to the electric chair...      120.  startle, Is this a message?  He sees inwards. And he knows it won't happen. Them=E no Mexico with Billie. There's no freighter to Manila.- He will die. This day, this month, next month. He knows that in this instant.  In this Hollywood version of life, the power of cause and effect operates on the end, as inescapably as gravity. It's a core truth. This is the only end for Blackie Gallagher. And its as true for john Dillinger in his life as it is for Gallagher. Actions and historical forces have made his time be up. Dillinger SLOWS the flickering images. His concentration slices time into component parts. Gable exchanges last good- byes. He warns his D.A. friend, Ronald Coleman, not to commute his sentence. The images play on Dillinger's face. They take him over-alone in the packed theater while 25 Federal Agents and five East Chicago cops wait outside.  The grin. End title music. People stirring. The house lights come up. Johnny doesn't move. He seems liberated. Released somehow. People in front and behind him start to exit. He sits there, holding onto his thoughts for a moment.     look right at him.

Reinecke's hand holding the gun is frozen in the air. He's paralyzed. He lacks the power to pull the trigger.  There's the man who slammed Billie into that car. Dillinger's lethal intent focuses on this one target. In milliseconds...          sees all of them RIGHT NOW. He pushes the .380 in SLOWED TIME Natasky.  falls through the air.    .tell Billie...

Ready.     7  Kid didn't fool with anything, did he? Dillinger, looking back at the boy, hasn't heard.      8.  Johnnie? All there? Dillinger lifts the coats on the backseat: their weapons are as they were.  Okay. And Berman? Wanna switch-out the \"shorts\"?      He's okay.  Well, I got rule four: stay away from women.  What's why they invented whores.  Hamilton leaves, arms around the women. Dillinger keeps his eye on Billie. Music ends. Young man escorts her to her table. He tries to join her. She turns him down. Dillinger finishes his drink, approaches. He now sees how beautiful Billie is. She's 5 foot 5. With a straight erect build, she stands out in any crowd. She looks Dillinger straight in the eye. Clear skin, dark eyes with humor playing about the edges. He unexpectedly starts to feel nervous. He gives her his best grin.     front sight rests on Zarkovich's heart which he would blow out the back of his chest with the souped-up 351 Winchester. Now, Dillinger pulls the '34 Ford out of the backyard with Red still on the running board. Zarkovich almost faints in relief.  cross through.  Why'd you sign that asshole's paper?  Oh Jesus...

Hamilton gets up to leave...     run along the line of the lake, but in woods now.  move fast. Not much brush to slow them. Dillinger senses, reacts...  I don't think so. Dillinger looks at Red's shirt. A blood stain blooms just above his belt. It's bad.  is in agony. Dillinger gets in back beside him. He's bought medical supplies from a drug store and whisky. He helps Hamilton to a slug and. some pills.  Not like you ain't seen a man die before.      91.   You gotta let...  You gotta let me go, John.  And you gotta let Billie go too.

    "description": "The difficult 1930s is a time of robbers who knock over banks and other rich targets with alarming frequency. Of them, none is more notorious than John Dillinger, whose gang plies its trade with cunning efficiency against big businesses while leaving ordinary citizens alone. As Dillinger becomes a folk hero, FBI head J. Edger Hoover is determined to stop his ilk by assigning ace agent Melvin Purvis to hunt down Dillinger. As Purvis struggles with the manhunt's realities, Dillinger himself faces an ominous future with the loss of friends, dwindling options, and a changing world of organized crime with no room for him.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)",
