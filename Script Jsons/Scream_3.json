        "Milton": "I can assure you that security on the set will be at an all time high. Again, the deaths are sheer tragedy.   Really, what was his name?  Before Kincaid can finish, Gale buts in.    GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.   Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.   Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.    Milton's on the phone with Roman.    Roman I know you're upset. But there will be other movies. I know. Ah, VARIETY called you a Pariah? Well fuck them. I got a great script on my desk. It's called TRAGIC  MENAGE TRIOS and it was written by John Sayles. I'm thinking you for Director. What?  Come in.  No, not to you Roman. Look I'll talk to you later. Bye.  Milton hangs up as Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey barge intohis office.   Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.   Who?   Do you know how many actors have worked for me? Hundreds, thousands.   What's your point?   I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?   What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.   When we did the first 'Stab\" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?   Get real, that would make me a suspect!   Yeah.   Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.   It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.   I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.    Milton steps out of his office into his reception area.  Secretary's gone for the night. Milton starts out of the office, disappears.    John Milton.   Who is this?    It's you. The saboteur whose been fucking up my movie!   I swear to God if you don't stop I'll find you and have you killed! I shut down production on that piece of shit STAB 3! We had a no talent director and the lousiest Sidney Prescott on the planet but that was besides the point! You still killed MY movie! A John Milton film! And if you ever try and cross me again you'll be sorry. My next movie is gonna be a grandiose step up from this slasher shit! It's a film written and directed by John Sayles.  Milton's going rapid fire.      Gale's trying to get a locked drawer on Milton's desk open. It won't budge. Dewey steps into frame, flashlight in hand. He shines the light down on the lock.    --has been strung up from the ceiling ventilation duct, gutted from knob to gullet. His entrails lie in steaming heaps at his feet.  GALE staggers away from the elevator, speechless. She screams again.  HER GHOSTLY ATTACKER is coming straight for her.  GALE fakes out the killer, dives into the elevator. He runs ahead, briefly, giving Gale enough time to trip him sending him landing flat on his face. Gale races out of the elevator doubles back down the hallway towards a door marked \"stairs\". She bolts through the door.",

        "Sidney": "SIDNEY PRESCOTT, the stoic, survivor. Now 24, she lies peacefully in bed, her black lab PETE curled up in a ball at her feet. A noise startles the animal awake. It sets off the bed barking hysterically at --    --awakens. She squints her eyes to try and make out what her dog is going into conniptions over. Then she sees, and her face loses any trace of color.  MAUREEN PRESCOTT'S GHOSTLY WRAITH is pressed up against the window. She's wearing a tattered, blood soaked night shift.  Her voice is muted but her lips are moving as if trying torelay a message to Sidney. Sid's hysterical crying. She slidesoff her bed, makes her way towards the window when suddenly --  MAUREEN slides down the glass, as if being pulled by somethingbeneath the window sill. Something we don't see . . . yet.       Mom!  Left behind in her wake are five bloody streaks running downthe glass. The streaks begin to bleed, as if each wounds themselves. They bleed right through the glass. Sidneyreaches out to touch them when suddenly --  THE GHOST springs up behind the window, shatters the glass panewith his fist. SIDNEY screams --    This is Laura in Monterey reporting in for work.   Thanks.  A click. A woman's voice comes on the other line. It sounds very familiar.   Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.   Are you sure?   Well then the people you need to call are the police.   I'm sorry, your voice.   Who the fuck is this?   W-what do you want?   You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!    No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.   The final act? Well let's play asshole!    If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!      Hi, you've reached the machine. Leave a message, talk as long as you'd like.    Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.   I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.   Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.  For a change, instead of an exchange of fists, the two share a warm hug.   Oh, you know, the usual small talk, \"What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?\"   Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?   Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.   Absolutely.    Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.  A figure lunges out of nowhere, startling all three of them. It's a young, scrawny goth girl in  heavy make-up.  This is KAREN COLCHECK, 22. She holds something in her hand, a video tape marked SCARY MOVIES 101.   Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?   She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.   It's been a while? You still working at Bradley's?    Oh MY god.   Thanks Karen. You be careful.   I can see nothing's changed.   Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.   No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.   No really, I'll be fine.  Dewey and Wallace nod. Sid begins to walk towards the soundstage.   I'll be right back.   H-hello? Anyone there?  Silence. Sid reaches into her pocket book, draws out a Gravity Knife. She flips open the blade, crouches down on her knees, scanning the row of stalls for feet. What a relief . . . none. Sid smiles, dismisses what she thought she heard when she sees --    Shit.  BAM! An exit door flies open. The GHOST comes charging out. Sidney screams, runs for a wooden fence. She begins to scale it, dropping over on the other side just as the killer pierces through it with his knife. Sid takes off running for WALLACE and DEWEY.    Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!   What are you talking about?   I was attacked in the bathroom.    What do you know about trilogies?   You seem to like movies, Detective.   I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.    Did you request this case?   Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.   Excuse me?   What do you mean?   Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.   Hmm.   I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.   How is that good news?   Oh yeah, how?   Hey Detective?  What's your favorite scary movie?   Detective Kincaid pauses, he leans over Sidney's chair, his penetrating eyes glaring right into hers.   Mine too.    Hello?    Hello?   Who is this?   Who is this?   Um wh-who's calling?   Um wh-who's calling?   Gale, Dewey, whoever, um, call me back, I can only hear myself.   Who is this?   Yes.   How do I know their voices are --   You're dead!   Where?    Fuck!  Wallace's keys rest on his desk. Sid ponders, takes them. She stands up when something inside her makes her open Wallace's drawer and dig around. She pulls up a fully loaded handgun.  That's the ticket. She closes the drawer, slinks out the side exit.    Yeah?    Alright, I'm here. Now what?   I thought you wanted me here?  Click the killer hangs up. Sid pockets her phone. She looks up, and is startled out of fright.  Posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production poster for STAB 3 with a life-size GHOST wielding a big knife. Sid knows she's in the right place. The door leading inside is half-open. Sid taps the holstered gun, slowly steps into the darkness.    Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.   Yeah?   Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!   Where are you Dewey?   Who are you?    Sid enters the set of her bedroom, slowly drawing out the gun she stole from Kincaid's office.  LYING on the bed, bound and gagged, is --    Gale he's got Dewey!   I know!      Dewey!  Sidney embraces Dewey.   They've got her!    Oh God.  BUT ANGELINA'S EYES OPEN. A SICK RICTUS SMILE FORMING on her lips.She pulls out a gun, aims it at Sidney's face.   It's you?! All of this is because of you?   Who the hell are you?   All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!    Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?    Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!    I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.  Sid squirms.   Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!    Comes rounding into the foyer again. Roman's right behind her.   Dewey my God I thought you were dead.    He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.  THEN A HORRIFYING SCREAM rips through the air.  ANGELINA comes racing out of the living room, face a blackened, Kentucky-fried mess. Everyone screams, one epic last scream. Sid raises up the gun, fires, hitting Angelina dead center between the eyes, sending a splash of blood and brain matter onto the wall behind her.    This shit is really getting repetitive, you know?  SID scrunches up her face in anger, pulls the trigger. BLAM! A CLEAN PERFECT  It was just something that's been itching to be completed for the past four years.   Take care Detective. Give my regards to the wife and kids.  Wallace nods his thanks as Sidney walks off through the studio gates, the sun rising overhead, as calm and as casually as if nothing's happened. SLOWLY, we crane up to an aerial looking down upon HOLLYWOOD. ANOTHER DAY IS BEGINNING.",
        "Prescott": "Sid locks and bolts the front door. She backs away from it as the killer begins to pounce against it, struggling to get inside. Sid hears something upstairs. Like muffled cries. She races up to investigate.    Gale and Sidney run into the master bedroom set, slamming the door shut and locking it. Sid looks around, her head already swimming from the chaos outside. However, what's inside utterly horrifies her. The walls, the furniture and the bed are splattered with blood. On the bed lies a corpse in a black rubber body bag . The door buckles under the killer's blows. Gale and Sidney scream. They can't hold out much longer.",
        "Christine": "No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.   All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.   I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.   Alright Hon, talk to you when the lights go down.  Ben smiles.    Has been gutted from neck to groin. She has been fastened to the cross-bar in the \"H\" with heavy rope. Her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the Southern California wind. Utterly horrified, Ben staggers into the shadows, not seeing --  THE GHOST as he rises from the void, knife in hand.  In one quick, brutal stab, the knife is driven into Ben's spine. Ben screams as he's turned around, face to face with his attacker.",
        "Mark": "",
        "Kincaid": "I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?   Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.   I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.   There's more.  Kincaid flips the article over. Someone has scrawled in black marker across the back \"SIDNEY\".   I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.   And who would that be?    They walk through the set. Gale's mesmerized. Kincaid is all business.   Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you awareof last night's Events?   Mr. Rielly, this was found alongside the bodies of Ben and his girlfriend.  Kincaid hands Dewey the ziplocked clipping. Dewey examines it, his fear slowly growing.   That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.   I'm going to have a little chat with the producers. Don't wander off. I may need you.  Gale nods as Kincaid disappears into the backdrop of the set. A Shrill voice  Well, I'd hate to see the production shut down.  I myself am a big STAB fan.   I am kind of dedicated to my job. Although I do enjoy taking acting around these studios anyway. I know my way around. My Uncle was a screenwriter for PARAMOUNT.   No, Mr. Milton, Miss Weathers is with me.  Milton nods his head, flags down the guard. He walks away.   I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.   Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.  Kincaid hands Gale his card, begins to walk out of the building.   That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.   Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.  Gale's eyes light up. She grabs Kincaid's shoulders.   I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.   In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.   Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?  Gale smiles. DETECTIVE TOM WALLACE, Kincaid's cohort and partner. He's in his late thirties. Family man. Wallaceenters frame with a folder in his hands.   No, cool it Wallace. She's working with me.   Mr. Bridger, you didn't tell us you spoke with Sarah Darling before she died.   Roommate says she knows your voice, Mr. Bridger.   Sarah Darling said you did.   Well I doubt they were stabbed to death and I strongly doubt the killer of them left messages on the scene for the police to find.  Camera pans through a two-way mirror into . . .    DETECTIVE KINCAID paces around his room. A battered and bruised Dewey and Gale sit beside his desk in Police Uniforms (since their old clothes has obviously been drenched).   Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.   Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something  Kincaid's eyes appear as if questioning Dewey.   That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.   Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.   Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.  Kincaid seems to be getting a morbid charge out of all of this. He smirks ever so nefariously at Dewey.   Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.   Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.   Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?   Do you wanna have this conversation with a polygraph?   When it's a threat, you'll know it.   Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?     What Rielly?   Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.   What?  When?   He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?   Hey, I'm the cop here.  You're in my office, Riley.  Sidney notices the clippings and the photograph of Maureen.   The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.   Are you sure?   Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.    Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.    Kincaid stands at his desk trying to put the pieces of this puzzle together. Sidney's seated beside him, staring at a stack of books on 'SCRIPT WRITING and  You mean like, movie trilogies?   Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.   All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.   No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.   To me Hollywood is about death.   I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.   I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.   Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.   What did you know about your mother?    Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.   Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.   Catch him, or kill him.  Kincaid readies himself to leave. He snags up his holstered gun, his car keys, jacket, etc.    My life.  Kincaid exits, door slamming shut behind him. A beat, then --   Jesus Gale what happened?   Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.    Sidney sits in Kincaid's office flipping through the folder marked 'SIDNEY PRESCOTT' It's loaded with newspaper articles and police reports and is basically a scrapbook of obsession. Sidney smirks. Kincaid has drawn little magic marker hearts around a picture of her. She's awakened from her daydream. The phone rings. Sid answers it.",
        "Maureen": "Gale and Sidney run into the master bedroom set, slamming the door shut and locking it. Sid looks around, her head already swimming from the chaos outside. However, what's inside utterly horrifies her. The walls, the furniture and the bed are splattered with blood. On the bed lies a corpse in a black rubber body bag . The door buckles under the killer's blows. Gale and Sidney scream. They can't hold out much longer.",
        "Studio": "A red BMW convertible speeds through the back lot. Behind the wheel is DEWEY RIELLY. Former Police Officer, turned Technical advisor on the red hot set of   Sarah Darling drives through the main gates in her porshe, rounds a corner.    The lot Is crawling with police vehicles.    Kincaid and Dewey's cars drive through the lot. They drive over towards a row of trailers, park.  KINCAID disappears to do something else while GALE, DEWEY, and Sidney get out of Dewey's truck.    Sidney, Gale, Karen, and Dewey are gathered around the inside of the small, cramped trailer watching the tape.    Sidney and Karen are hugging.    Gale's banging on the door trying to gain access. Nobody home. Gale notices the card lock and the sign reading  'AUTHORIZED PERSONAL ONLY'. Gale smiles. Since when has this ever stopped her before. She reaches into her pocket book, pulling out a couple of credit cards, a video store card, etc. She tries them in the lock. NOTHING.  A hand reaches down, grabs Gale from behind. She lets outa blood curdling scream. It's only JENNIFER.    Sidney stands beside Dewey and Detective Wallace.    Sidney comes charging around the corner of the soundstage building. She looks up, realizing she's just ran herself into a dead end.    Gale races out of the office building. A car horn blares. She screams.  KINCAID jams on his breaks, gets out his car. He draws up his gun.    Sid parks Wallace's car alongside the studio gates. She gets out, stands on the hood of the car, begins to scale the wrought-iron fence.    Sidney creeps through the darkened, abandon lot. Again, her cellular rings. Again, she answers it.    The police, fire, and ems are all on the scene of the crime.  Dewey's wheeled out of the studio on a stretcher, loaded into an ambulance.",
        "Executive": "",
        "Roman": "Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.    Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.    Honestly, my life.  A eclectic hush falls over the crowd. Roman appears somewhat sinister in this light. Gale gazes deeply into Roman's eyes.   Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.  Roman smiles. The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into applause. Gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of the set, watching from a half-open exit door. Now it could be just her imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade.  A LOUD BUZZING O.S.  Gale is startled out of her skin. She looks up at a sign hanging over the stage. THE WORD \"COMMERCIAL BREAK\" is illuminated in flashing red light. Gale sighs, looks back to the exit. The GHOST is gone. She turns to Roman.    Sure.  Gale bolts for --    Roman's office is a clutter of old movie memorabilia. Sarah plops down behind Roman's desk, admires his old TRANSFORMER toys and two brass MUSIC VIDEO AWARDS. Sarah examines the award.   Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.   All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.   You're not happy with your part.   Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.   Page 22, Candy's big moment.   Hello.   Who's this?   Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?   But you know my favorite name?   It's Sarah.   It is in my script.   It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.   My movie.  A pause, then a familiar dark natured noise enters our ears, the killer's sinister voice.    That's because I didn't.   What meeting?   Wait a minute!  I never called her! I never told her to go   anywhere!   Well, she wasn't speaking with me!  Look, I did not call   Sarah Darling!   Someone is trying to ruin my movie. Someone wants to kill   my movie!     Ha! Too late, studio's shutting down production.  Called my film a risk! Do you believe this shit?  They're actually shelving my film because there's been one ensie little murder. God, three people died during the filming of The Exorcist.    Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.   I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.   And I kinda keep her around cause it's a bit of a turn-on. You know, in the movies she's you Sid, so every time I jump her bones, I'm doing YOU, technically.   Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.    Awesome. What'd I tell ya? Heh. Did youknow that John Milton, was my daddy? Yep, he's the one who fucked mommy dearest in the long run.  His parties, his flings, exploited the Hollywood nobody! That's whyI had to make him pay. Daddy dearest is dead. Mommy's dead.
