        "Ben": "Paul sits alone on the bench, freezing cold, eating a donut. Some kids from across the lawn yell good-night to him.   Paul?  In the background, we can see Wendy watching Richard Nixon on  Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?   Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.   Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...   Hold on for a second.  Wendy, you want-to say hi to your brother?  She frowns.   Come on!  She gets up sullenly and goes to the phone.    Hey, that's the president of the goddam United States you're talking about, Wendy!  From the kitchen, Elena overhears. She's dressed to go out, but in the process of making a Kraft macaroni and cheese dinner for Wendy.    OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?   Gotcha.  He puts the bottle back down without pouring.   His brother came back --   Vietnam.   The Unitarian? The new one?   He's either got his head in the clouds or up his --   Hell! -- I mean, no problemo there Mikey. Here, I --  Janey leans over with her napkin and attempts a cursory wipe of Ben's pants. Is there a just barely noticeable frisson between Ben and Janey as she removes the napkin? If there is, Elena doesn't -- or pretends not to -- notice.   No, my job is just to analyze the entertainment stocks and advise our institutional investors on where to put their money. It's --   (with a bit too much  conviction) And as usual no one believed me...  Silence.   Hey Jim, next time you've got to fill me in on whatever it is you're up to these days.   You'd think she'd learn how to cook a chicken, eh? My drumstick was still frozen when you cut inside there. I'm probably going to get whatever that disease -- and Jim, how that guy ever became a millionaire --  He pauses before a hall table, and, with his eyes, traces the telephone cord under Wendy's room.   Hmm. I knew she'd still be up. Watch this --  But Elena simply continues into the master bedroom.  He starts to pull gently on the cord. And continues pulling. No response for a few seconds. Then:   Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.  Wendy opens the door to her room.   If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.  She slams the door.  He opens it.   Hey!  Wendy jumps into bed and under the covers, pulling them up over her head. He stands over her, looking down at the crumpled pile of sheet and blanket.    Hey, kiddo. Sleep well, huh.  He places his hand where her cheek should be, and caresses the sheet.   Good night kiddo.  Ben turns to the door, where he sees a silent Elena standing in her nightgown, a slight smile on her face.   I wasn't star--   That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.   Why shouldn't she be?  Elena just gives him a look, more sad than angry.    Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...   Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.   Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that \"I'm OK. You're OK\" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --   Elena.  Silence.   Good night.   But what, exactly, is stagflation, this mixture of inflation and stagnation, and how should we in the securities industry understand and accommodate it? Well -- and I hope I'm not out of bounds here - think of the money supply as a large male organ, continuously inflating, and yet, the societal vaginal cavity simply wants more. As the vicious circle of higher returns without real satisfaction continues, the money-organ may seem to be in demand, but in fact even the most inflated capital is unwanted. This is why I suggest that while we engage this mawing abyss for the highest returns, we at the same time fantasize, so to speak, of the safe harbor of capital appreciation.  The aging boss nods agreement.    Ben is gathering papers, readying to leave. He looks up to see George Clair in his doorway.    As we see that Clair is deftly fondling Hood's attractive secretary as she is seated in the cubicle beside the door to his office. She looks up coyly at Clair, hidden for the moment from Ben's view.  Ben comes out of his office, pulling his coat on. Clair and the secretary pull back, but it's clear that Ben has some sense of what's transpiring between them.   George, I'm just trying to get a global view of things -- can't just look at the small picture.  There's an obvious rivalry between the two of them.   Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?   Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.   Got a meeting uptown.   Up the organization!  Bastard.  The secretary pretends not to hear.   We don't have to always go to your club, dad.   -- Well what am I supposed to call you?   I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --   You know, dah--  He looks up and sees his father slurping his martini, not paying attention.   Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --   Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --   But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --   -- What advice? You never --   -- 73    But...   But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.  His father rolls his eyes and stabs his salad with a fork.   We were golfing, and you know, golfing to me is something I'm supposed to enjoy, and I was on the goddam golf team in college, so it's something one would assume I do well -- I used to do well -- but basically these days golfing for me is like hoeing, or plowing.  Janey smiles briefly at this.   It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --   Yeah?   You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.   Gotcha.  She wraps a blanket around herself and gets up.   Can't wait to see how it fits in with all the other instruments.  Elena gives him a look.   You want to go?   Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.  He comes up behind her, looks down at the checkbook.   I'm, uh, going to bed.   Rough day. Good night.  He leans over and kisses her on the cheek. She sniffs.   Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?   Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --   Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.   What?   That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.   Elena. I need some help here if this thing's gonna defrost by tomorrow.  She comes up and together they tug and pull until they succeced in extracting a large, frozen turkey. As they pull it out, it slips from their hands and, after a dull thump, slides along the floor.  They smile.  Elena bends over to pick it up. Ben observes her. She notices his look.   Here.  He goes over and picks up the turkey, placing it in the sink. He looks back at her and notices her vaguely distraught look.   You all right there?   Um, yes.  They stand together, his concern and her vulnerability forming an awkward attraction between them.   I do. I'm -- are you...?    You know Elena, I've been thinking--   You crying?    Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --   You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?    Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got --  Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.  He gets up and starts to get dressed.   Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.   What?   Hey there Mikey, how's business?   I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?   What you been up to?   So how's school treating you?   Classes?   Grades?   Anyone special? You know...   Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?   You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well --  He makes a sharp turn. Paul puts his arms up on the dashboard to steady himself.   Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --  He pauses to gauge the effect of his monologue on his son, then continues.   Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.   All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great.   Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.   Thanks.  In the doorway, Elena waits.   Stuffed and baking.   Anyone home?   Sure you will.   Well, it's great we can all be together. And this Thanksgiving, no hysteria, no yelling, especially with grandpa not here, although we miss him. So let's do it right and actually, Wendy, why don't you say grace. You used to love to say grace, remember.  Wendy grimaces, as they all bow their heads slightly.   Jesus all right enough!  They all unceremoniously start to dig in.   After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?   You know, I think Elena might suspect something.  Janey gives him a rather contemptuous look.    Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?   Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a lot lately, and -- No, that's not it. I guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. On the verge.  Janey gets up.   Huh?   Right. Gotcha.  She leaves the room.  He leans back onto the bed. Sits back up. Takes a sip of vodka. Puts the glass down. Takes his socks off. He's now in just his jockey shorts and shirt.  Faintly, he hears a door close. The front door?  He takes another sip.  He hears another sound.   Janey?  Nothing.  He goes to the door and carefully opens it.    Janey?  He hears, quite audibly, a car door open, close, Janey's car start and pull out.  He runs to a front window just in time to catch a glimpse of her driving off.   Shit.   Water bed! Dig it!  He wiggles comically, making more waves.   What the hell are you kids doing down here?   What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood --   Don't you direct a single word at me, Mikey. I don't want to hear it. I'll be speaking with your parents about this situation very soon. Bet your ass on that, son. Young lady?   Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!   I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.  She stands next to Mikey for a moment, both on the verge of tears.   Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.   I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...  She looks at him. They keep walking. She walks through a puddle.   Your toes cold?   I'll carry you up the drive.  She puts her arms around his neck and he lifts her up.  On her face, as he carries her -- a look of blank but real intimacy.   You go dry off now.  Wendy heads for the stairs, Hood following.   Never guess where I found her.  Not much response From Elena.   In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -   I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.   Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.   Yeah, that one.   Stay out of trouble.   Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?   Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?   What's for dessert?   No advice from the experts, huh?  His plate slips out of his hands into the trash. He fishes it out and sets it on the counter.   You think I --   What's on your mind? Don't --   What do you mean?   Elena, what are you're talking about?   Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --    Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?   Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?   What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.  Silence.   It's the law of the land... the government, the world, those two guys on the Yankees... And I'm not having any fun at it, I can tell you that. I'm not...    Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.   You've...   Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.   I know, I know. I had no idea --   Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?   I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.   I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --   I'm not.   Elena.  She rubs her eyes.   Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --   Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.   Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?   Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?   Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.   Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?   Damn right, but where the hell were you?   (whispering, but too  loudly Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?  Janey takes a sip of her drink.   What?   Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --   I just can't believe you could be so --  Stalling, he watches her take another sip of her drink and wander off.  The air is filled with talk of Watergate, Billie Jean King, the Oil Crisis, the Mets.  Benjamin goes over to the couch, where Dave Gorman is chatting up an attractive younger woman.    Thanks for the advice Dave.  But then, Benjamin changes his mind.   Uh, well, what the hey...  Taking the joint, he tugs on it, holding the smoke in his lungs.    Good shit.   It's what?   Darn it, Dave.  He rises unsteadily, weaving through the room's conversations.   As the Indian saying goes, pain is merely an opinion.    Ready to go?   Sorry... maybe I should... the bathroom?    Sorry, I'm sorry. Uh, I'll be back.  Dot follows Mark Boland down the hall behind Ben.  Suddenly, it's just Elena and Jim Williams, and Sari Steele and Rob Halford.   Elena.   I'll drive you --   (looking up at her, with  gratitude Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?   Jim -- he was just up --  in Silver Lane -- I think maybe -- a power line --  Jim picks up his son.  He carries him silently into the house.  Sandy, now standing inside the foyer, pushes himself back against the wall as they pass, without expression.  After a moment, from outside, the Hoods can hear Jim's wailing.   Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --   Yeah. Well, we can just --   Paul? Yeah. You think --   C'mon.   There's something -- your mother and I -- have to tell you two --  Elena puts her hand out, almost touching him.",
        "Hood": "It's a modern (shag carpet, geometric-patterned wallpaper, etc.) suburban house.  Ben Hood talks on the phone, a drink in his hand.    Ben and Elena walking past Wendy's room to their bedroom.    Elena is sitting cross-legged, eyes closed, on her side of the bed. We hear the toilet flush from the master bath, and see Ben emerge in his boxers. He pauses in front of the bed, looking at Elena.    Ben is gathering papers, readying to leave. He looks up to see George Clair in his doorway.    As we see that Clair is deftly fondling Hood's attractive secretary as she is seated in the cubicle beside the door to his office. She looks up coyly at Clair, hidden for the moment from Ben's view.  Ben comes out of his office, pulling his coat on. Clair and the secretary pull back, but it's clear that Ben has some sense of what's transpiring between them.    Wendy enters the house as Elena is finishing supper preparations.    Ben and Elena take their seats on the sofa. Wendy stands before them holding an enormous trombone, with a music stand and sheet music in front of her.  She puffs a series of seemingly disconnected notes in waltz time.  When she's done, she looks up from the sheet music to her parents.  They applaud.    Elena is sorting through bills and writing checks at the kitchen table. Ben comes in and fills a glass with ice.    Elena sits in a yoga pose.    Elena enters the garage from the kitchen and turns the light on.  She finds an old bicycle and pulls it out.    Janey comes around the back to discover Sandy stuffing a model airplane with m-80 firecrackers. He lights them and runs back a safe distance. The plane explodes, its wreckage joining the debris from a few other dolls, models, and toys.    The taxi pulls up. Elena gets out and pays the driver.    Ben is in front of the open freezer, trying to get something out. He hears Elena come in the front door.    Ben and Elena enter their bedroom. Elena closes the door quietly behind her.    Ben and Elena undress shyly.  They make love. Elena's face is almost fearful.    Wendy walks and Mikey rides along.    Ben exits the house in a rush, and sees Wendy and Mikey on the street in front.    Wendy enters the house and climbs the stairs.  She sees the crumpled bed sheets in her parents' room and hears Elena in the shower.      The car pulls up. Paul gets out, looking shell-shocked. He sees Wendy waving to him from a second floor window. He nods back.    Paul knocks on Wendy's bedroom door. She opens it.    Morning. To establish.    Elena is coming out of the master bathroom in a robe, a towel wrapped around her head.    Ben Hood pads down the hall in his bathrobe, tries the bathroom door. It's locked.    The shower is running, but Paul is standing by the open window, puffing on a joint and trying to blow the smoke outside.    One by one, each member of the Hood carried in a final item to place on the overstuffed Thanksgiving table. Then, one by one, they each silently take their seats.  They look over the table. No one moves.    Hood and Wendy enter, wet and cold, muttering hellos.    Hood finishes taking off his wet clothes as Elena enters and turns on a light. She stands watching him.    Elena and Ben emerge from the house, and look up at a darkening, foreboding sky. A light rain falls. They jog toward their car.    The car moves slowly through the rainy suburban streets.  Inside, Elena and Ben don't speak.    Wendy enters the bathroom.  She fills the sink with water, then turns off the tap. She takes a razor blade from the counter, and slowly, determinedly, holds it to her wrist.  She presses it into her skin, drawing a small drop of blood.    Wendy picks up the phone.    The phone rings. Wendy picks it up.    Wendy emerges from the house and gets on her bike, but the ice makes it too slippery. The storm is now in full swing. She gets off and walks.    Ben drives home.    Ben continues to drive slowly. He looks out his side window, and sees something. He puts on his brakes.    Sunlight floods in and temporarily blinds Ben as he starts the engine.  He squints, his eyes tearing a bit from the light.  He looks around, first at his wife, then at his two children sitting in the back seat.  He turns off the engine. Quietly, he begins to cry.  He turns to the back seat.",
        "Mikey": "(not looking up, but  alarmed Who said so?   I don't have a girlfriend.  Mikey returns to his reading -- a copy of The Sensuous Woman, obviously well pawed over. He absentmindedly picks his nose. As he flips the pages, a beautiful, almost electrical HUMMING SOUND begins to fill his ears. He frowns and pauses to listen to it.  Sandy, who has picked up a balsa wood miniature plane, obviously doesn't hear it.  Mikey focuses on the plane as Sandy waves it through the air. Perhaps the hum is the sound of its engines as it soars through the sky...   (as he returns to the  group, ball in hand Did anybody hear that?  The other kids snicker. Wendy looks on, and catches Mikey's eye for a fleeting moment.   Want some gum?   (opens his mouth,  displaying the gum on his  tongue I'm chewing.  She puts the Twinkies back, and pops the gum in her mouth.  They stand together chewing.   Tell Sandy? What?  Wendy doesn't say anything.   You didn't tell him either, did you?   Yeah?   Sure, anything but this English.  Sandy puts the open textbook in front of him.   I'm not good at math. Just geometry.  He looks at the book.   (drawing out his examples  on a piece of paper) It's like, you know when they say \"two squared\"? And you think it means 2 times 2, equals 4? But really they really mean a square. A square with a side of two. And the area of the square is four. Like every time you use the word, like squared, or cubed, it's really space, it's not numbers, it's space. And it's perfect space, but only in your head, because you can't draw a perfect square, like in the material world, but in your mind, you can have perfect space.  You know?  As Mikey goes on, we see his geometric doodles, and hear faintly the HUMMING SOUND under his voice.    You were gone?  Sandy looks at Mikey as if pondering a lost cause.   Uh, I dunno. OK I guess.   Because of molecules we are connected to the outside world from our bodies. Like when you smell things, because when you smell a smell it's not really a smell, it's a part of the object that has come off of it -- molecules. So when you smell something bad, it's like in a way you're eating it. This is why you should not really smell things, in the same way that you don't eat everything in the world around you - because as a smell, it gets inside of you. So the next time you go into the bathroom after someone else has been there, remember what kinds of molecules you are in fact eating.  An embarrassed silence.   (honestly oblivious, as  usual I dunno.  She pauses, then walks into the kitchen.   (without looking up, in  unison Thanksgiving break.  She walks out of the room again.  Sandy comes in, whip in hand, looks over at Mikey and Wendy, then walks over to them, and, without a word, slumps down beside them and watches the TV.   I don't ever want to see you.   I dunno. I --  They're now in front of the Hood's house.    Business? Uh, I dunno.  Ben grimaces, fiddles for his car keys.  As Mikey remounts and rides off, Wendy passes her father on the driveway.    Benjamin walks in, an obvious look of distaste.  He sorts through a few of Mike's things -- monster eyes that glow in the dark, The Sensuous Woman, etc.  He twirls the garter belt absentmindedly, then tosses it into the back of Mike's closet.   See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?   There's a TV in the basement.  Hood hears their steps down into the basement.   Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...   Why did you -- with Sandy?   You like him? He worships you.  But Wendy doesn't seem to hear -- she's drawn to an object lying next to a bean bag chair off to one side.   Wendy!  She puts the mask on.    When worlds collide.   4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.  Ben arrives, folds his arms.   Hey, hang on there, Mr. Hood --   You're parents at that party?   You get in trouble?   I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.   Out.    Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.  Sandy just looks at him. He walks out into the night.   Oh shit.  Glued by an electrical pulse to the rail, he shakes as the current flows through him.  After a minute, his body slumps and slides down the road.",

        "George": "Hey there Benjie, you're becoming quite the in-house philosopher. When do you have time to think up all that stuff -- Shackley sure eats it up.   And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?   Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?   Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?    Right o'.   Benjie!   Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!   Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?   Yeah, good.  Benjamin catches a glimpse of Janey, voluptuously attired, across the room.   Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.    In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.  At this, they both notice Elena slowly gliding across the other side of the room. Clair gives Ben a sideways glance, then moves on.  Ben makes straight for Janey, who pretends to be preoccupied with a plant.",

        "Janey": "Ted, how romantic.   Please don't.   I insist.  Don't touch them.  Elena realizes that there's an edge to Janey's voice.   (realizing she's gone too  far It's really quite all right.   Ironic?   Ben--    You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.   You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.   Good trip?  He nods and puts his suitcase down, then sits heavily on the side of the bed.   Jesus, Jim!   Just be careful.   Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.   Need a lift?    Elena sits in the passenger seat. The two women are obviously uncomfortable with each other.  Silence.   Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.   It's not like we're too busy.  They smile, barely.   Social work?   Educated guess.   You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.  She pulls the car over.   Here you are.   None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.   Sandy!  Sandy looks up -- busted.  Janey marches over to him.   You little idiotic prick, you could blow yourself fucking sky high with all this demented crap.  Sandy looks on the verge of tears. She softens and bends down to him.    Hey. (picking up the  firecrackers I'll take this stuff.   Would it matter? (sees something else lying  on the ground And what's that?   It's not packed with explosives, is it?    Play with the whip.   Oh. Hi Wendy.   Mikey, have you heard the explosions coming from the backyard?  Do you know what Sandy's been up to?   Don't you kids have homework?    Shit.   A person's body is his temple, Wendy. This body is your first and last possession. Now as your own parents have probably told you, in adolescence our bodies tend to betray us. That's why, in Samoa and in other developing nations, adolescents are sent out into the woods, unarmed, and they don't come back until they've learned a thing or two.   Here.   In a bit.  She sits next to him, he kisses the back of her neck.    Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.   I'll be back.  Benjamin looks at her quizzically.   Birth control.   Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.    What are you talking about?   A prior engagement overcame me.   Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.   How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --   Wait, this is the training, where they don't let you go to the bathroom?",
        "Philip": "Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?   Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.    No need to make excuses --   It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --   Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --  Elena looks outside the window, and sees Wendy speed past on her bicycle.   (a bit taken aback by the  abrupt topic change They say you never forget.   Forget how to ride a bike.  Silence.   In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.   -- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.   You ask what the point is?   Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?   If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --   You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.    Now you are being rude.   Ouch.  Just then, Dorothy Franklin passes by their table, a smirk firmly implanted on her face.    I believe so Mrs. Franklin.   I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?   That I will indeed.   Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?  He sits beside her.   Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.   Forgive me.  He walks swiftly to the hall and hurriedly fishes his keys out of the bowl, then heads for the door.",

        "Francis": "Cramped, a mess, but quaint. Paul shares the room with Francis Davenport IV, a dissolute, smart-ass son of money.  Paul's alarm clock rings. He slams his hand down on it and jumps out of bed, fully clothed in his rumpled preppie uniform of frayed khakis, loose tie, shirt with one tail untucked in, etc. Across the room, Francis beckons from his desk, as he finishes loading up a four-foot-high bong.   Arise and shine, young Hood.    The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&amp;Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.  Paul reluctantly walks over and takes a hit. He coughs, spewing uninhaled smoke.   Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.   Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?   See ya.   Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.   And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.  He waves his fingers toward Paul's eyes, in the classic \"stoned\" gesture, then wanders off.  Paul looks on at the gathering. Marge waves to him from the dance floor.   Do what?    Um, Libbets Casey.   Aha! I could sense the vibe.   Am I right or am I right?   My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --  A knock at the door.    You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.   All will be revealed, baby.  The television is turned on to a weather report about the coming ice storm.   Awesome sleet and rain.   Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead?   (nasal voice,  impersonating a TV  character Moisture! Moisture!   Hell on the fillings.  Paul opens the other two beers and hands one to Libbets. They light up a joint.   Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.   Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.  Paul takes out the bottle and opens it.   Pharmaceutical! You are a god.   Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?   Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.

Why are you so good at math but not in English?   Yeah. But I just need some help with my homework.  A knock at the door. Jim stands in the doorway with a suitcase in his hand.   You really didn't notice? Man, he's been gone for three days.    Wendy's backside, her pants pushed outward in the back, affording Sandy a libido-charged view of the top of her bum crack.  Push in on a close-up of this cherished abstract landscape, then back to Sandy's furrowed face.   You going to tell dad?    You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.   No!   Well, you can...   All my model planes.   They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.   Yeah.  But he stays put, unaware it seems that he's blocking the doorway.  Wendy looks around -- no one in sight.   What do you want?! What do you want? Get out! Get out of here!  The door flips open -- and Janey Williams appears.   Where you going?   It's freezing.   Wendy.  She gives out a little yelp.   What are you doing?   Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.    Are you his girlfriend?    Sandy and Wendy are sitting on the floor. He grabs his G.I. Joe.   Check this out. He's supposed to talk all kinds of stuff, but he's like malfunctioned.  He pulls the dog tag on the doll, and G.I. Joe emits a plastic macho voice.   Same thing. Again and again.  Wendy takes the doll and yanks the cord.   It's gonna get a lot colder tonight, I predict. Probably a blackout. Do you have candles in your house? I know where the candles are, and I have my own flashlight. Over there. Also, I know where every emergency exit is on this floor.  During the course of his monologue, as Wendy looks on, Sandy calmly ties a noose for his doll.   This knot's called a bowline.  He puts the noose over the doll's head, as Wendy holds him.   Let's hang him.  Sandy drapes the noose over the edge of a dresser drawer. G.I. Joe dangles. They both look at him in silence.  The silence continues.   If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.   Communist Viet Cong.   We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?   It's just -- it's just --  She takes his hand, and they walk out of the room and down the hall, into the guest room.   Vodka?   It feels warm.   Okay.  They drink.   Huh?   I love you.   I don't know. How do I know?   I don't think I'm spinning.  They cuddle up together.  He yawns. She yawns.   Dad?  Jim looks at him.",
        "Paul": "In issue number 141 of The Fantastic Four, published in November 1973, Reed Richards has to use his anti-matter weapon on his own son, who Annihilus has turned into a human atom bomb. His son is the result of Richards' coupling with the earthling Sue Storm, and the problem is that the cosmic rays that infused Richards and the rest of the Fantastic Four on their aborted moon mission have made young Franklin a volatile mixture of matter and anti-matter.   And that's what it is to come from a family, if you analyze it closely. Each of them is negative matter for the other ones. And that's what dying is -- dying is when your family, which is in fact your personal negative matter from which you emerge -- it's when the family takes you back, thus hurling you back into negative space...   So it's a paradox -- the closer you're drawn back in, the further into the void you're thrown.    Cramped, a mess, but quaint.

I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.   (gathering books, papers,  almost talking to  himself Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.   (spraying some chloroform  mouth spray I gotta get to English class.   Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?

You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?   Good thinking Marge.   No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.   Where you going?   Flame on, asshole.    -- because I've been reading Kerouac and Ginsberg and those guys were creating beat culture and traveling and sleeping wherever, and, of course, with all kinds of people, but when you read carefully the various contemporary accounts of their lives, and, uh, these guys didn't bathe much, I mean they were really filthy, with like genital crabs, lice, exceptionally strong body odor...  Libbets smiles through her yawn.   How can you do that man?   Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.   What?   What do you mean?   Shit. You're not planning --   Don't mess with Libbets. I mean it!   Hello?   Hi dad.   I'm fine dad.   Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --   Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?   Watching what?      Hey Charles. Charles, calm down -- I wasn't in on it.  Elena, putting on her coat, comes into the den and gives Wendy a kiss on the forehead as Wendy mumbles her good-byes to Paul on the phone.   To find yourself in the Negative Zone, as the Fantastic Four often do, means that all everyday assumptions are inverted -- even the invisible girl herself becomes visible, and so she loses the last semblance of her power.   All right.   Good.   Fine.   Hnnn.   Yeah.    About?   Uh, Dad --  Just then Ben runs a stop sign and almost slams into another car.   Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.   Sure dad.   Hello, Charles.

Well, uh, I don't, it's really --    Libbets, you really shouldn't mix and match, you know with the beer. I'll put 'em back.  Libbets reaches into his pocket and pulls out the bottle.   Maybe you should have just a half.   I guess he's just real exhausted from, you know, tests and stuff.  Libbets is herself somewhat in dreamland.   You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --   Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.   It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --   You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --    -- like a brother.   Yeah, you're not alone with that line.   Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?    Charles, what time is it?   What time is it?   I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --   Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.   What are you doing at home on a Friday night?   Oh shit!  Paul gets up, looks down at her.  She snores.  He runs over to a side table and sees the clock: 11:10.   Oh shit oh shit.  He grabs his comic books and runs for the door.   Oh shit oh shit.

How you guys doing? How's school?  Mikey's still flustered.   Hmm. Alright!  He walks off.    You bet.  It turns out it's a water bed, and his weight creates a wave that nearly pushes Janey off her edge of the bed.   (jumping up, which only  creates another wave Sorry honey.

Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.   Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really.  They sit down on the sofa.   You want coffee or something?   Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?   What the hey. Let's go for a drive.   Nah, that wasn't in the contract.  But they still walk around turning off lights.  In the hallway, Elena looks a bit mournfully at the light seeping from underneath the bathroom door. She hears the sound of running water from inside.  Then she goes into a sideroom and joins Jim. They pick up their coats.    They climb in.   We're going to have to defrost this thing for a while.  He turns on the ignition, and the vents start to blow cold air at them.  He leans over and kisses her.   That was awful, really awful. I'm so sorry, Elena.  Elena has somehow worked herself into the cavity of the glove compartment, and is trying to figure out how to extricate herself.   Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --   Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --   That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.   Of course.  She opens the door and walks back to the house.    Elena gets in. They drive off silently.   You okay?   Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.   You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.   Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --  He walks into the kitchen. The pipes have begun to burst. There's a water leak running down the walls, forming a puddle on the floor.  Elena has walked into the kitchen behind him. She leans against the counter, picking up the garter belt without thinking for a second, then putting it back down.   Oh well.

Do you get free tickets to the movies, that kind of thing?   And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.   You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.    Well, um, yes. Ironic.

He enters the room with the beer.   Frankie opens them with his teeth.   Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?  Paul and Francis exchange a look.  She puts an Allman Brothers tape on the 8-track and turns the TV down.    Paul enters the bathroom. We hear Francis' and Libbets' voices from the other room, laughing.  He pees.  At the sink, he pauses in front of the medicine cabinet, then opens it.    Paul re-enters the den to find Francis alone.    No candy for me?   What is it?   Let's see!   Oh far out, Paulie. Hey look, these expired like five months ago. You think they're better aged?  She opens up the bottle and takes one out.   Thanks for the advice dad.  She takes the pill.  Paul looks on, thwarted.    Paul, Francis, and Libbets sit on the floor, listening to the music blasting at full strength.  Libbets and Francis are obviously on the verge of unconsciousness. Paul regards them with a look of apprehension on his face.    Libbets puts a blanket over a sleeping Francis, who's crashed out on the floor in a corner. Francis alternates between snores and various mumbled delirious ravings.   Yeah.   Yeah but you don't even know me really.   My what?   And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.   And I have a feeling for you too, because you're just like -- I feel for you like you're -- you're just like --    -- like a brother.   I do.   (consciousness fading  fast Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.  Her head bobs and weaves, her eyes close, and suddenly her head falls forward with a whoosh toward the couch -- smack dab between Paul's legs.  She begins to snore instantly, her open mouth nuzzling into his crotch.  Paul doesn't move, doesn't even breathe. Then, slowly, he leans his back into the couch, without shifting the rest of his body.  He looks as though he has simultaneously won the lottery and received a lobotomy.    Libbets and Paul in the same position whence last we saw them.  Paul delicately leans to one side of the couch and picks up a phone. He dials a number.    Paul and Libbets, still frozen in the same position. Finally, Paul gently pushes Libbets' head back.  It slides off his leg and, as Paul lurches forward in a failed attempt to grab it, Libbets flops backwards, her head hitting the carpet with a dull but decidedly loud thump.",

Well, you looked very -- free -- when I saw you.  Wendy continues setting the table.   Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.   Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.   The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.

Is that a new aftershave?  He recoils a bit.   Hmm. Good night.  He walks uncertainly from the room. Does she suspect?   You're saying that Christ is the child, and --   All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?   That's right.   I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.   I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.   But not too ashamed.   And you're still trying to get me into bed.   I suppose we'll make an appearance.   (gathering her things to  go I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.   Thanks again. For the dinner.   I used to know how to cook.   I'm thinking of going back to school.   How'd you know?   I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --    Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--   Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?   Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.   I... I think I am...   Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--  She kisses him as if she needed him.   I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...   No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --   I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.   You were saying?  He smells the armpits of the shirt he's putting on.   That shirt?   Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.  He looks at her ruefully.   The turkey in?    Dinner in ten minutes.   Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.   So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?   Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.   That one.  She walks down to the kitchen, Benjamin following her.   You'll be on the 10:30 train?   Paul --   See for yourself.   Don't start.   I have no idea.   It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.   Don't be dim.   I'm not surprised.   Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.   It's a starting place.   If you're going to insult me --   Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.   Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?  Seemingly tired, he stands before her. Silence. Elena sighs, then walks into the den.   We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.   I suppose. Why?   What sort of problems are you planning exactly?  Elena kisses the top of her head.   Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.   Oh, damn. Uh, I've left the --   In the car.   This just isn't the best moment for this.   That this was going to be a key party?   Well?   Damn it, Ben --   You're not going to --   You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --   Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.   Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.  She pulls the keys out of the ignition, gets out of the car, and slams the door. He follows her.   Oh, Dot!  Elena, entering the house again, tosses the keys at Dot Halford, who looks surprised.  Hood slides in behind his wife.  Dot drops the keys into the bowl.  Slow-motion, close up: the keys, on their equine chain, fall in with a THUNDEROUS CRASH.   Reverend Edwards.   You're here... I'm a bit surprised.   I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.  Philip's about to reply, but thinks better of it.  They sit glumly next to each other for a minute. Then Philip rises.   We're not going anywhere.  Elena waves at Janey Williams, who is standing across the living room.  Janey looks back without expression.   Rob, we'll fix it for ourselves. You two go and get acquainted. We'll let ourselves out the front door.  Jim and Elena stand there alone.   Let me.  She takes the bowl and dips her hand in. Two sets are left. One, her own, she avoids. She takes out Jim's keys and walks across the room, handing them to him.   You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.   Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --   My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.  They both look at their hands.   Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --   Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--   Do these seats go back?  That starts it. He jumps at her, unbuckling her and unzipping himself.  They tangle uncomfortably for a few seconds. And then, comically, he's in her.  With a groan, it's over in a flash.  Jim pulls himself off, readjusting his pants.   Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.   Well, we can talk about it.   Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?   Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?   Ben.  She sits on the toilet next to him, stroking his hair.   You're in no condition to drive. We'll talk in the morning, OK?  He sits, accepting and quiet.   You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?   We'll talk in the morning.   Yeah. You?   Sure. Maybe coffee.    Get dressed.  Elena walks out of the room, back to the kitchen.  Wendy gets out of bed quietly, leaving Sandy sleeping peacefully.  She looks at him lovingly, and tucks the blanket back up around him.   You should let him sleep.  Wendy enters. She looks inquisitively at the two adults.   It'll warm you up.  Elena sits next to her. They both raise their cups and sip the coffee, not noticing the simultaneity of their movements.   Ben?  He's too breathless to speak.  They stand there, looking down at Mikey.  Behind Elena and Wendy, Jim appears.  He pushes softly by them toward the body of his son.   The phone's out.   Ben, I don't think he wants us here.  Wendy has been watching Sandy through the screen door.   Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --    Ben.  Paul looks at Wendy, silently asking her what's happening.  She casts her eyes downward, as does he.   (her hand still not yet  touching him Ben.",
        "Wendy": "Charles.   I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?   Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He should be shot.   He's a liar! (still talking more to her  father than into the  phone Dean told him on March 21st about Kalmback and Hunt, all about the payoffs to the Watergate burglars, so you tell me where the so-called \"Dean Report\" is, but you can't because it doesn't exist, because he lied about Haldeman and Erlichman and the April 17 tape, that's why! Liar!  Ben retreats, going to the wet bar to pour another drink.    There is a large poster of a cartoon version of Richard Nixon \"Tricky Dick\" -- on her wall. Wendy is on the phone to her friend Beth.   -- he knows that when the March 24th tape -- you know with Dean, where Dean tells him that there's a cancer growing on the presidency --  She pauses as Beth asks a question.   Who? No way. He's like a big infected whitehead wearing jeans. I wouldn't --  She hears the downstairs door open.    -- shit, it's my parents.  She turns her light out.    Dad stop it!   Fascist!    Ben enters the room, angry.   (without pulling the sheet  down, but nicely Good-night dad.    Wendy hears her parents' door close and sees a strip of light illuminate under her door as the hall light goes on, then off.   She's a liar. I wouldn't touch Dave Brewster's dick if you paid me. It's probably crawling with v.d. after he put it in her, which he did.  The conversation peters out at this point, as the two groups of girls give each other the hairy eyeball from afar.  Wendy looks through from beneath the bleacher seats onto the field where the boys are playing.  A group of boys break from a huddle, Mikey among them.  The quarterback takes the hike and Mikey runs out for a pass. As he runs, his breathing increases in volume, filling his ears, and transforming into the humming sound he'd heard before.  The quarterback spots him and throws a long one.  He runs in an oblivion of beautiful white sound.  The ball drops next to him as he continues, in a world of his own, to run.  Suddenly, the humming ends and he stops and turns around, to see all the other kids just standing there looking at him. One of them makes a pot-smoking gesture, as if that's the explanation.   I gotta go.  She takes hold of her bicycle and pushes off.   Hey Sandy.   Yeah? See ya.  She pushes off on her bike.  Sandy gazes after her. He takes his G.I. Joe out of his coat pocket, and points it at her.   Sure. (pulling them out of her  pocket Twinkie?    Did you tell Sandy?   Hi mom.   With Mikey?   Nobody.   We were just riding around.  Elena takes this in.   Mom. Are you ok?   You're not a psycho!   I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --   Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --   They need the money for my band uniform at school.   I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.   Hi Mrs. Williams.   (without looking up, in  unison Thanksgiving break.  She walks out of the room again.  Sandy comes in, whip in hand, looks over at Mikey and Wendy, then walks over to them, and, without a word, slumps down beside them and watches the TV.   After you.  Sandy hesitantly opens the door, as Wendy still hovers by it.   Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.   The ones you built?   I have to go to the bathroom.   I'll show you mine if you show me yours.  Sandy goes wide eyed, and almost against his will backs into the bathroom like a feather.   Then why'd you come after me?   You have to follow me?   Nah.   Nothing.   Greetings, Charles.    Paul and Wendy sit on the floor.   Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.   Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.  They both ponder silently. Then:   Why don't you use the phone downstairs?   Can I come?   With who?   Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?   Dear Lord, thank you for Thanksgiving, and for letting us white people kill all the Indians...  Everyone looks up.   ... and steal their tribal lands and stuff ourselves like pigs  Mutterings and groans: \"Wendy!\" \"For Christ's sake\" etc.   ... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --   Maybe we can just watch some TV.   I don't know.   I don't know.   Hey, what's this?  With a look of utter fascination, she picks up a Nixon mask, looking at it as though it were an archeological find.   Wow!    I won't take my pants off. But I'll touch it. That's as far as it goes.  Mikey looks totally confused.  Remaining fully clothed, Wendy loosens Mike's belt, showing no excitement from behind her mask, and lets him climb on top of her for a dry hump.  Just then, a shaft of light hits them from the top of the stairs -- Ben towers above them, looking down.  Mikey flips over immediately and pulls his clothes together, grabbing a TV Guide as Wendy stands up, the mask still on.  As Ben descends Mikey, still stuffing his shirt-tail into his pants, pretends to flip through the TV Guide.   Huh?   What do you think we're doing, dad?   Talking to me, dad?    Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.   Huh?   Yeah.  He stops and lifts her in his arms.   Shoot.   (eyes still glued to the  Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.    Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.   Ouch!  She drops the blade and splashes water on her wrist, grabbing some toilet paper and holding it against the tiny wound.   Stupid.  She hears the phone ring and walks downstairs.   Hood residence.   Yeah. Yours?   Maybe. Can't really tell yet.   Yeah.   Maybe.   Hood residence.   Is this Charles?   Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?   And?   Right.   I have plans.  Paul hangs up the phone and looks down at Libbets.  Libbets' Allman Brothers tape has run out. The machine makes a repeated clicking sound as the take up real continues to circle. The only other sound is the noise of the wind and rain lashing against the apartment's windows.   Anyone home? Hello.  Wendy wanders into the living room, then climbs the steps. The sound of the wind and the darkness begin to scare her.  She goes into Mikey's room -- it's even more of a disaster zone than usual.  She sees on the wall his dark-light poster of the 12 positions of the zodiac.  She notices the black garter belt on the floor, and picks it up, absentmindedly swinging it in her hand as she walks out of the room.  She walks back down the stairs and into the kitchen, leaving the garter belt on the counter.  She opens the refrigerator, grabs a jar of peanut butter, and scoops some up in her finger. As she puts her finger in her mouth --   Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.   Just thought I'd stop by.   Yeah.   No.   He's dead.   He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.  She takes him down and lays him flat on the bed. And then begins to remove his clothes.  Sandy looks on, desirous.   Well. (noticing his lack of  anatomy) It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.   They left it in the jungle.  They speak with high seriousness.  Wendy slides up on the bed where Sandy sits, a pillow on his lap, and one by one, with exaggerated slowness, she removes her snowboots, as if they were stiletto heels.   Can I get into your bed?  With you?  Sandy begins to shake.   Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.  Sandy begins to cry.   Want a drink?   You never tasted the stuff?  She fills the glass to the brim and hands the bottle to Sandy.  They clink and each toss back a sip -- Wendy almost the entire glass.  Sandy coughs and gags, but swallows.   Try again.  He does.   One more shot?   Under the covers.  Under they go, and soon every layer of clothing emerges.    Get 'em off.  Sandy begins to laugh, and soon Wendy joins him.  They roll around on top of each other for a while.   Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?   That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.  Sandy shakes his head.   They didn't tell you this stuff yet? What planet do you live on?  Sandy doesn't answer, but climbs back on top of her and kisses her neck.   That's nice. Are you drunk?   I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.  Sandy rolls off her and lies on his back.   Where's dad?   I don't like coffee.   Wait, I --  She turns back up the front steps and gently goes in --   He's probably been waiting all night at the station."
