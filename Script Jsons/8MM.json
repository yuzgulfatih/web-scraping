        "Max": "Big date tonight?  Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?  My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.  It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.  Thank you for shopping at Adult Bookstore.  Have a nice day.  Once you pick it up you can't put it down.  I tear off the cover and paste this one on... You know how it is.    Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.      I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.  Three, four years.  Max.  There's not much illegal.  You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.  You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.  From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?  How much?  Four hundred a week, off the books.  Sounds good, pops.  Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.    Come on.  Fuck you, Larry.  You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A <u>week</u>.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.  What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.  There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.  I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.  First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.  Twenty-five.  I don't know, where are yours?  I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.  You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?  I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?  So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are <u>you</u> doing mixed up in all this?      You're learning.  Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...    He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.  I'm a working stiff, pops.  You want me to come out there and play private eye?  See ya.     You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.  Great.  Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?  Dino Velvet.  Wha... ?  He's one of the lunatics Dino uses. He's in a bunch of these.  Why?  He have something to do with whatever you're into?  I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...  Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself \"Machine,\" that's what they call him.  Machine.  They say he's half brain-dead from all the steroids he's using.  He's a brutal motherfucker, man.  He loves what he does for a living.  What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?  You're the only one still shooting film and transferring it to video. Nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore... the grain, the gritty look you get.  I know if I had to pick, it'd be \"Choke,\" or \"Devil.\"  What's next?  Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?  What's this?  Look... that's awful generous and everything...",

        "Amy": "Welcome home.  What's this... have you been smoking... ?  Your clothing reeks of it.  I'm not accusing you...  Okay, I believe you.  How's the detective business?  You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.  I love you.  You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?  You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?  Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.  I understand.  I know.  Why the gun?            ... What's going on?  What happened to you?  What's going on, Tom?  What happened?  Tom...  Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?  You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?  You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.  You couldn't?  No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!  You should have.  Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...  You're killing me...  What was I supposed to think happened to you?!  Who are you calling?  What?  Tom... she's dead.  She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...  How could you not know?  Promise you'll stay.  Promise me.  Tom?!  How much forgiveness do you think I have in me?  Tom... ?",
        "Welles": "Follow that limousine.  Don't get too close, don't let it get too far away.  Just keep with it.  Nope.  How about this... every cigarette I smoke, I give you five dollars?  Do you know how much I missed you?  Smoking?  I'm not smoking.  You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even \"hello,\" you accuse me... ?  Well, I'm not smoking, okay?  We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.  Hello, pumpkin-head, did you miss me?  I sure missed you...  Let's get my bags and get the hell out of here.  Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.  Honey, I'm not, please...      I love you.     What's all the trouble, Cinderella? What are you crying about, huh?  Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night. The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...  No, sir, he is not.  The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...  Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.          Sure.  I'll call the guy.  I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless. You have bridge here Saturday?           I try to be.  Uh huh, pleasure.  I'm listening.  Of what sort?  That's right.  Thank you.  He's odd.  I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.  My condolences.  I'll do whatever I can to help.  Pittsburgh?  He succeeded.  I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.  You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.  Do you want to tell me what you found?  I'm afraid I don't...  Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment? I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a \"snuff film.\"  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.  Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...  If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...  I'm sure it is. It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.  Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.  You... you need to go to the police.  You don't have any other choice.  It won't work like that.  I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...  Nothing remotely like this.           This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.  Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.  It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.  I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution. Don't worry about me.                                Call me Tom.  What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...  Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...  Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself... That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch... They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.  I figured you share information.  For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.  This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.  They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.  They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.  Who knows... maybe she's already given her parents a call, right?  Fuck.  Any good?  You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?                 Nobody really uses eight millimeter film anymore, so we can assume there are reasons our guys did.  First, they could develop it themselves if they had any sort of expertise. Obviously, this isn't the kind of movie you can just drop off at the one-hour photo...     Second, the film that went through the camera is what we've got. There's no negative.  Unlike video, it wasn't meant to be duplicated. No reason for them to risk having more than one copy of their murder floating around...  There don't seen to be many fingerprints on the film itself, but I'm going to have to be careful to leave them intact...  It's okay for yours and your husbands fingerprints to be on the film, but you'll have to use me as a middleman if you go to the police. That way I don't have to explain why my prints are on it...     There were three men.  Two are obvious; the man in the mask and the man running the camera, but I caught a glimpse of a third man in a mirror.  It's nothing that can be used for identification, but he was there, watching...  So, there were three.  They would have kept it small, wouldn't have let anyone in on it they didn't have to.  That's all for now... except, I feel I should tell you... with this looking like it happened at least five or six years ago...  Well, it's not very likely we'll ever find out who this girl was. I will, I'll keep trying. Goodbye.        I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.  I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?  These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations... ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...  What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...      I'm sorry, I know this isn't easy. Is there a more convenient time... ? Can I buy you lunch, would that be alright?  It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.  That's exactly what I am.  You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.  It's refreshing to actually sit down and meet someone face to face, someone nice like you.  So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?  She just seemed... depressed... ?  What was she running from?  If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?  September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.  Why do you think he did it?  You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter... Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?  I didn't mean to...  I had to ask.  I apologize.  Of course.  I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...          We're all like that.  No.  I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.  It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.  Do you think the police did a good job?  It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...  If the police focused their search in <u>her</u> room, <u>her</u> belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.  Will you let me look?  You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't. Wouldn't you rather know?  You were right. I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?  Do you ever consider... do you realize that Mary may never come back?  It's been six years.  Excuse me, I have to use your bathroom.        Is this pretty much it?  Just... just videos?  Nothing.    Pardon me?  Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.  I'll risk it.  What are you reading?  Catchy title.  What are you really reading? Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.  Truman Capote.  Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.                       Remember me?  I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.  I'll be outside having a cigarette.  Good for you.  How long you been working there?  What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?  Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...  Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.  I'm not a cop.  Not quite.  Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.  How much do you make now?  Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.  Here's my number if you need it... When can you start?  See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me \"pops.\"       No.    Anything harder?  Snuff?  You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.  Interesting theory.  Child pornography.  Snuff films.  What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?  How old are you?  Where are your parents?  I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?  You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.  You're telling me it doesn't get to you?  What about me?  A daughter.  Good question.            I'm not positive this means anything.      I'm here.  For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.  Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?  You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.  Her name was Mary Anne Mathews.  You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...  I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.  What is this?  Her belongings?  Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?  I'll do what I can.        This is better. This will be fine.  No thank you.     Okay, I'll take it all.  Cash.  No, you may not.  Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.  Eddie.  I know what you did.  I know what you did.  You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...  You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.  Come on, Eddie...  ... come on...  That is you, isn't it, Eddie?          Specialty product.  Where does he sell it?    Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?  Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.  Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.    I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?  I hope it's nothing serious.    I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.  If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.  It's their Presidential Suite.  It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?            Max... wake up...    No... it's nothing... that's not him.  Who is he?  Who is he, his <u>name</u>?          You don't need to be here.  We're looking for Mr. Velvet.  Why don't you tell him we're here to give him a large sum of money.  If he's not interested, we'll go.  You heard the boss, Milo.  It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.  I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.  A fellow investor.  \"Devil\" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.  Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.  That's five thousand dollars.  Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.  I want to watch you work.  And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.  If it's not him, there's no deal.  We can do that.  I'd rather you didn't.  I'm camera shy.  Those are two different kinds of trust. Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.        I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.  Nope.  This is for you.  It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.  It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay? Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.  I'll see you around.         Where are the women?    Sure.  What are you... ?  Look, I don't know what this...  I remember him.  No...  Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...  He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...  I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...     You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.  So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.  Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.  That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?  Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...  Except, you're willing commit murder with them.  Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.  You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't <u>find</u> you one, Longdale, they went out and <u>made</u> you one...  Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.  Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?  Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?  I'm asking.  Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?  Enlighten me.     No, I've got it.     Fuck you.  You'll get it when we get there.  Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.  No!!  You fuckers!  Don't... please...  Motherfuckers.  Small time, motherfuckers... !  Tell me something...  I know why you did it, Dino, Eddie... but, why'd the lawyer do it?  Must have been a helluva lot of money, right?  One fuckload of money...  So, what are you all still doing small time, huh?  What are you still doing in the sewer, Eddie?! Christian gave Longdale a million dollars to find him a snuff film. How much did you ever see... ?  One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...  Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?  No, no, no... please, don't kill me... please... !  Back off, Eddie...  Stop Eddie!    Come back, or I put a hole in him.  You might make it to your gun, but not before I shoot Machine.  And if I have to shoot him because of you, and I don't kill him, right after he kills me, he's gonna kill you.    Take it off!                     Just do it, Amy, please, go.                             I don't know if I can do that.  I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?  I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...  It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.  I don't know.  I'm sorry...  I wanted to call.  I couldn't.  You don't understand...  I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.  Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.  I don't know what to say  Don't...  Amy...  Forgive me.  We have to stay here a few days. I'll get more clothing from the house if I can.  I'm sorry. We're going to be okay.  Mrs. Christian.  She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.  I just talked to her.  Promise you won't go back there, wherever you were.  Whatever it was, forget it.  I promise.     Hello, Eddie.  Put your hands on your head.  Put your hands behind your head, lock your finger together, get down on your knees.  I owe you a few.  Don't go anywhere.  Don't bore me with that bullshit.  Don't ask questions.  Starting to recognize a pattern?  Who is Machine?  I want his name.  I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.  Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.  Told him you could get him a snuff film.  How much did he pay you?  That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?  So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.  What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?  I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!  Show me!  Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.  Because we're going there.  That night... you didn't have to be in the room, but you were. Why?  Why did you watch?  You enjoy it?  Tell me what happened.  Nobody saw you bring her in?  What did you do with her body?  Show me.  Keep moving.  Stop talking.  Show me where you buried her.  Where?  Show me where.  I can kill you.  I can leave you out here, just like you left her.  Don't think I won't.  Easy enough for you.  That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you \"felt like it.\"  Almost makes you worse.       She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...  Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.  Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...  They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...  He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...  They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...  They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...  I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there wasn't anything anyone could do...         ... abdominal wound.  You'd know him if you saw him...                                   Hello?!  Amy?                     I can't talk about it yet... not yet.                 Why... why... ?      I have to tell you... I have to tell you what happened.  I have to tell you everything, but we can't tell anyone else.  No one else can ever know.  You're all I've got.  You're all I've ever had. You're the only one who can save me.",

        "Longdale": "Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.  As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.  You are a private investigator?  Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.  Let's get this over with.  Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.  That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.  I was well compensated.  Never mind how I found you.  They're no friends of mine.  None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.  Shut up.  Shut your mouth and drive!  You're making me very angry.  You're asking me why?  A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...  Isn't it incredibly obvious?  Because he could.  He did it because he could. What other reason were you looking for?  You've got four minutes till I call Mr. Velvet and let him know there's a problem.  You almost went over your limit.  Give me the film.  Give me the film.  He's lying.  Stay away from me.  Stay back!  You have a gun, Eddie, show it to me.  Now!  Put it on the ground, kick it here...  Move back!  All of you... move!  Back off!  Everything's been taken care of, and I'm leaving now...  I'm leaving.  Stay where you are!  Keep back!  Our business is done, I'm leaving, no one's going to stop me...",
        "Eddie": "You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.  Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?  Look, you cocksucker...  Fuck you!  Celebrity Films.  Yeah, who's this?  What?  Who is this.  What the fuck are you.. ?    I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.  The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...  I'm telling you...  Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!  Dino...  Is that him?  This is the fucker?  Motherfucker, doesn't look like anything...  Doesn't look like shit.  Move it, dirtbag... !  You're a dead man.  Fuck off.  What the fuck... !  ... sorry...  What's he talking about?  What the fuck's he talking about?  You sell us short, you fuck?  You fucking lawyer...  You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?  Fuck.  Do him good.                            I'm gonna kill you.  How'd you find me here?  Fuck you!  What do you want?  I don't know...  I told you, I don't know.  What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.  Yeah, the fucking lawyer.  Yeah.  Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.  It was a lot of fucking money.  Something like that.  What the fuck do you want from me?  Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!  You wanted to know, now you know.        That's right, motherfucker, cut me loose.  Be a man.  Why?  What are we doing here?  I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.  Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.  What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...  There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.  Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.  What are you thinking you're gonna do... ?  Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?  You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...  You got absolute zero.  I don't know... ... out there somewhere.  I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.  You'll never find her.  Nobody ever will, and even if they did, it doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em all.  Without the film, it never happened.  Don't you get it?  It's over.  You can't do anything.  Do it.  Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?  I never killed anyone.  What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?  Where you going?  You're the one with the gun.  Aren't I defenseless enough?  Come on...  Go ahead and kill me.  Kill me with that gun, your gun, right, registered in your name?  Dig the hole yourself, with your bare hands, bury the body with your bullets in it.  Fucking do it!  You pussy.  Fucking pussy!",

I'm not so sure about this.  I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...  Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.  Excuse me... Tom, hold on...  Listen, maybe I can help after all. Why don't you come on back in... we'll see what we can do.  This is it.  It's not much. We've got less than five percent on computer and we lose that funding in December.  I'll have someone show it to you anyway.  Other than that, I'm afraid it's the wet thumb method.  Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.  It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.

I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.  No.  She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.  I don't know.  Yes.  We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...  It got to be too much for him.  There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...  You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.  No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.  People remember me from the news. Can you drive me back now?      This is her room.  The police made a wreck of it, but I put it back exactly how it was. Just how she likes it.      Okay.        We weren't religious.  We never forced religion down her throat, like I've seen some parents do to their kids.  We never made her go to church.  But, after Mary was gone, that's when I got religious.  Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.  Are you religious?  You should be.  What?  There wasn't one.  The police looked.  I don't know.  I think so.  No.  You don't have any reason to think that...  How... how can you say that to me...?  My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...  Go ahead and look if you want.  I don't care what you do.                   Yes.      I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.  What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right? She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her... ... or her being dead and me knowing... I'd choose to know.                       What are you talking about... ?  What... ?  Who is this... ?  Who are you?  No...  No... no... no...  Why... why are you doing this to me... ?",
        "Mrs.": "",
        "Christian": "Mister Welles. You're very prompt.  I appreciate your coming on such short notice.  This is Mister Longdale, my late husband's attorney.  Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.  Yes, how theatrical.  So you've gone on the record, and now perhaps you should just be gone.  Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles?  He's a lawyer. Please, sit, here...  I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.  You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.  As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.  His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.     His inner sanctum.  Not many people have been inside this room.  Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building. He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He <u>wanted</u> to be legendary.  We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.  Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?  Just curious.  My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.  There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me. I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...  Cash, stock certificates, and this...  It's a film... of a girl being murdered.  This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife... I only watched what I could.  I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...  No.  I'm telling you it's not that.  Will you watch it and see for yourself?                    I told you I can't, not yet.    Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.  You've found missing persons before.  I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it. I feel responsible, Mr. Welles. You saw what he did to her.         The checks were for odd amounts...       Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.    Hello... ?  Do you think the film could have cost that much?  Okay.  You told me to look, so I looked.         I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.  Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?    How will I get it to you?",

So close to nothingness that it cuts with minimum effort, because it's so non-intrusive.  Flesh is fooled.  It blooms open as the blade widens, but by then it's too late, because the knife's already doing its pure, simple damage.  Ah, ours guests have arrived.

If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.    Leave him alone.  I promised him to Machine.  First things first.
