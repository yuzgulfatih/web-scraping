        "John": "I can't get over how different you look.    Lady, move!  Before she can do so, Sid 6.7 stands behind the Woman, grabbing her and throwing her across the table into Parker. CRASH! They tumble to the floor.  In the same movement, Sid 6.7 removes a gun from inside his jacket and shoots John in the shoulder before he can fire. John's gun flies from his hand. Sid 6.7 advances toward him.  Parker struggles to his feet. Aims his weapon. Sid 6.7 does the same, but without looking. BOOM! Parker gets a bullet through his shooting arm. His wound IDENTICAL to John's. Parker's weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp.  Parker charges him wildly, but Sid 6.7 brutally kicks him in the stomach. In perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in the background. Parker doubles over, gasping for breath. Another kick drops Parker to his knees.",
        "Donovan": "",
        "Lindenmeyer": "I did fix it.. I told you I did. I don't know why it happened again.    How much do you think I care?  Parker, still not fully conscious, hurls himself at Lindenmeyer.    Don't touch me!...DON'T TOUCH ME!!!  He flails his arms wildly. Nearly spasming. This is clearly a man who should never drink coffee. TWO armed GUARDS, who've been standing in the background, pull Parker off Lindenmeyer and throw him to the ground.  Lindenmeyer watches with satisfaction as the guards put Parker in handcuffs and leg chains.    Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?   Think hard -- it'll come to you...  Wallace enters briskly.   The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.   I'm still making adjustments...      I understand... I understand perfectly.  Wallace ignores him as he walks toward the door. On the monitors, Sid 6.7 starts walking toward you. Into a CLOSEUP.    He hears...everything.    Lindenmeyer storms in angrily. Sid 6.7 is visible on the virtual reality monitors around the simulator. He's giving himself a manicure.   All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!    It was you, wasn't it?   You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!    My God...   What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?    Hey, Reilly, Sheila 3.2's been asking for you...   Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.    Do I get to see it or not?   All my work is my finest.  Sid 6.7 continues appreciating Sheila 3.2. As Reilly races back in, the monitors then all go BLACK.  Reilly, completely out of breath, holds a python by it's head. He dangles the snake right in front of Lindenmeyer's face. Terrifying him.    Get that fucking thing away from me!    It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...    It feels so.. .real.    This is supposed to be years away.    How do you kill it?   Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.   I think I understand what you have in mind...  Peeling the label off the Sid 6.7 character module, Lindenmeyer removes the module from its slot. Sid 6.7 disappears from the screen.   You need a maid.     in Culver City. Magic hour. Parker pulls the squad car into a space across the street. Hitting the vehicle parked in front of them. In which two UNDERCOVER COPS sit waiting to see if Lindenmeyer returns. Parker waves apologetically.    Madison races through the broken front door to find Parker checking his weapon. Before she can speak, he motions for Madison to freeze and be silent.  Parker hears Something. Something moving inside the duplex. His every movement is now that of a predator.  Madison awkwardly removes her own weapon from her purse. She does not handle it with confidence. Parker shakes his head.    It's as if the Information Superhighway ended in here. Cluttered stockpiles of hardware and software: computers, books, folders, disks, and tapes.  What you notice, however, is that ALL THE DATA relates to DIFFERENT KINDS of CRIMINALS: serial killers, mass murderers, terrorists, kidnappers, rapists, bombers, extortionists, anarchists, you name it, it's here. The psychology of, the methodology of, the history of, the encyclopedia of, the autobiographies of human villainy.  CLASSICAL MUSIC and lifelike SOUND EFFECTS can be heard coming from a computer. This is what Parker has been hearing. He holsters his sidearm. So does Madison. Who checks her pulse.    Looking around the room, Madison shakes her head.    Madison stares at the computer screen in awe. Parker flips through CD-ROM hard copies of the different versions of Sid.    watching the news on a pocket TV on a wooden bench that morning. Both proud and horrified at the monster he has unleashed upon the world. You hear CLASSICAL MUSIC in the background.  Lindenmeyer begins to laugh. Uncontrollably. The sounds echoing. As WE PULL BACK, you realize the bench is one of many inside the Hollywood Bowl.  Lindenmeyer is the only person sitting in the stands. He glances down at the members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic as they rehearse for an upcoming performance.  Whatever the event is, it's going to be big. Dozens of technicians surround the stage, setting lights, cameras, microphones, etc. for a live, payperview broadcast.    There is only one way to get any more information out of Sid 6.7...  They scan the area for a new mode of transport. And find one stopped at a dumpster down the block: the garbage truck.    Parker lies unconscious on a bed. He is connected to the simulator via the neural connectors in the polyurethane skull cap, just like he was before.  The Sid 6.7 character module is plugged into the system's main console. Lindenmeyer sits at the controls. Madison next to him, her gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head.  They are both watching Parker chase Sid 6.7 on the monitor in front of them. Parker continues experiencing intolerable pain. A clock reads 4:00 AM. They are the only ones inside the entire facility.   I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.    How should I know?   I wonder how that...   He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.   If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of  I need you to hold this. It can't get any dirt on it.  Madison is reluctant, but doesn't know what else to do. Lindenmeyer slowly gives the neural connector to her free hand.   All you have to do is hold the needle at the base. Just make sure not to jab yourself with the point...  She clutches the needle in her left hand while aiming her gun with her right. Lindenmeyer removes a second neural connector from Parker's skull.  Holding this second needle at the base, Lindenmeyer makes several adjustments on the neural management computer, then moves slowly back to Madison.   Hand me the connector nice and...  He suddenly jabs his neural connector into Madison's right forearm. Madison has no time to react. 10,000 volts of electricity instantly courses through her body.  Madison drops to the floor, unconscious. The needle she had been holding falls from her grasp, breaking the circuit. She stops being electrocuted. Which saves her life.    God, some people are stupid.  He sits back down at the simulator's main console, and starts to type commands. On the monitor, Parker is visible exiting the shopping mall.    She's taking a nap at the moment.  He types a set of instructions into the console and hits  But don't worry. You won't be alone for very long. Fairly soon, you'll be dead.  He removes the Sid 6.7 character module from its slot and exits the station.   Come on, live. Live!  The synthetic nervous system begins to crackle with life. Growing around the module. Forming the beginnings of a new head. Literally.    Madison, still unconscious on the floor, finally stirs. Maybe Parker's screaming is finally reaching her. Or at least, starting to.   Of course you are.  Sid 6.7 wades through the trash toward Lindenmeyer.   Help me get out of here.    What...are you doing?!  Sid 6.7 takes Lindenmeyer's face gently in his hands.   I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!    Madison forces herself into consciousness.- Or as close to it as she can get. Her expression is one of complete and utter terror.    Madison keeps pressing the return button over and over, making sure it worked. Parker's eyes flutter as he returns to consciousness. Madison rushes to him.",
        "Karin": "Mommy's home! Mommy's home!  Karin's BABY-SITTER opens the door for Madison as she carries her daughter inside.  Parker stares from squad car in surprise. Even disbelief. He had no idea Madison was a mother.  Moments later, Karin comes back out and sits on the front steps. Staring at Parker. With fascination. Curiosity. Wondering who this strange man is, and why he's sitting in a police car outside her house. But not saying a word.  Parker stares back as if carrying on a silent conversation with her. A multitude of expressions passing over his face as memories of his own daughter flash through his mind.",
        "Carter": "",
        "Elizabeth": "looking at the fifth photograph which Madison has placed in front of her inside the Viewing Room.",
        "Deane": "What did Cox pull him out early for?    Don't remind me.  LAB ASSISTANTS remove the polyurethane skull caps from the two unconscious bodies. The acupuncture needles remain in the caps. You can now see the faces of the participants:  Parker and John.  Parker lies calmly, his eyes fluttering as he gradually returns to consciousness. He looks very different than his virtual rendering:  His hair is long and ragged. His face is unshaven. A scar across his cheek. A hoop earring in one ear. His outfit a filthy prison uniform.  John's outfit matches Parker's. Physically, he looks as cleancut as his virtual rendering. Except that he is convulsing. Violently.  His flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around him. Like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure. It's ugly. Frightening.    What the hell happened?    Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.   Again?!    Why wasn't I told?   Then about all I've spent $37 million developing is a very expensive way to control the prison population.  After giving Wallace a cold, hard stare -- namely at his hand stitched lapel, his gold watch, and his diamond-studded cufflinks, she exits. Wallace follows after her quickly. You now notice that the chair Dr. Madison Carter had occupied is now empty. She left a while ago.  Cox remains. Lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator as if it were his child. There are several scratches, but no major damage. He looks relieved.   I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.   Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.  Parker, looking at her incredulously, moves his index finger circularly, as in get on with it, already. Cox opens a folder and shows Parker several PHOTOGRAPHS of Reilly, or what was left of him.    You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.   Think you can do it?    This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.  She slides an unsigned pardon across the table to Parker, making sure to stay beyond his arm's reach. Cox reveals a worn, L. A. P. D. badge. It was Parker's.    Catch him and your record's clean.   If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.   This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.    Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?   But only you will know he's not human.  Parker's expression is one of  yeah, that figures. Madison enters. She cannot see Parker behind the barber.   We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.   You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.  The barber moves back from Parker, revealing his clean shaven face. It takes Madison a moment to recognize him with his cleanedup appearance.    looking at the fifth photograph which Madison has placed in front of her inside the Viewing Room.    That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?   Not if you're with him every step of the way.   I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.   What are they doing in Los Feliz?   Why would they be going there?   I wish we could hear them.    Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.    You were right, Dr. Carter. Letting a lunatic like Barnes loose in the real world did pose an unacceptably dangerous risk to the public.  I should have never tried to solve one problem by allowing the creation of another.  Chief Cox will give you a ride back to the station. You will provide him with any and all information you have developed thus far.  Enjoy the rest of your sentence, Mr. Barnes.  She exits. Cox and Parker stand facing each other. Cox wishes there was something he could do. Parker looks completely out of it. Cox extends his hand. After a moment, Parker takes it. But his mind is way off elsewhere.   He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?   You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe online, yet?    This had better work, Mr. Wallace.  Wallace exits the room. Cox has no idea what is going on. And Deane is not about to tell him.   Barnes, where the hell have you been?!   What did you find out?   It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?   Enough to level an entire city block.    Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...   You know how much man power you're talking about?    This better not be a wild goose chase.    Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.   Thank God.    What's the problem?",

        "Barnes": "His body is a running back's. His endurance a marathoner's. His face one you'd want for your own. He's in his 30s. If he was in his 20s, you'd still be jealous.  His partner is JOHN DONLEY, late 20s, eager to prove himself. He struggles to keep up with Parker. John accidently knocks over several pedestrians. They give no reaction, except to pick themselves up and continue on their way.  Parker and John keep charging. Their conversation breathless:    He knocks Parker back with a good shot to the face, then disappears around a van.  Parker continues the hunt. Quietly. Carefully. Tension grows in the silence that follows.  He carefully makes his way around a truck. Only to see Sid 6.7 swinging a two-by-four directly at his head. WHAM!!!  Parker is knocked on his ass. Daze4. Blood streams down his cheek. He staggers to his feet, blocking another blow with his arm. Which SNAPS the wood in two.  Parker grabs one of the boards. He battles with Sid 6.7.  The fight between Parker and Sid 6.7 is intense. Exhausting.  Parker gives it everything he has.  Madison appears behind Parker, holding his gun. She wavers, having trouble keeping her balance. She has even more trouble aiming her weapon.",

        "Wallace": "Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?    Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.    I was assured the problem was corrected.   Black book dollars, black book operation. You pay me for results, not how for how I get you there.   You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?   Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.   You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.    You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?    How does he know who I am?    As a matter of fact, I do.  He exits.   This is Wallace...   Congratulations, Reilly...  He pops the cork, and pours their glasses.    To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.   As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.    Do they have to look so...robotic?   My engineers say the audio tap should be ready to field test in six months.  Off Cox's look, we    It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.   Online and at your disposal.   Just an unrepentant criminal who is apparently going to die from a previously undiagnosed brain tumor.  Cox enters, concerning Wallace.   What are you doing here, sir?   What happened?!",
        "Matthew": "",
        "Grimes": "He savagely hurls himself against his confines. Bone vs. metal. Don't try this at home.",
        "Clyde": "",
        "Reilly": "As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.   Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.   At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?  He remote controls the robotic sentry to chase Wallace out of the station. Lindenmeyer can no longer be seen through the gap in the partition.   Oh, believe me, it is. It is...  He is so aroused, he's shaking. Lindenmeyer, on the other hand, appears almost uninterested. He's used to the routine.  On the monitor, Sheila 3.2 continues her striptease.  Slowly. Sensually. Licking her lips. Grinding her hips.  Putting on quite a show.  She removes her top, revealing ideal breasts. She fondles her nipples. As well as the rest of herself.  Lindenmeyer and Reilly continue watching. Reilly can barely control himself.  Sheila 3.2 is very, very, very good at what she does. A virtuoso stripper. Reilly is transfixed. Until Lindenmeyer pushes a button, BLACKING OUT the virtual reality screens.     I haven't been working on anything.    Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.  He rushes out. Sid 6.7 appears on the various monitors next to Sheila 3.2. He kisses her cheek. Caresses her body. Sheila 3.2 enjoys the attention.    You're...such a wimp.  He grabs a large pair of scissors and snips right through the snake. The half of the snake which drops to the floor stops moving.  But the half still in Reilly's hand begins REGENERATING a new tail. Literally growing a new one. Lindenmeyer can't believe his eyes. He studies the snake closely.   Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.    Coordinated by polymer neural net.   It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.   As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.   Separate the character module from the neural net...  Using Lindenmeyer's scissors, he cuts off the snake's head and removes a small character module connected to the base of the neural net. The snake stops moving. It \"dies.\"   ... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.   I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...  He exits. As Lindenmeyer reaches for the Sheila 3.2 character module, Sid 6.7 appears on the screen in front of him and winks.    opening his office door for Lindenmeyer fifteen minutes later. Reilly immediately double bolts the door behind him and leads Lindenmeyer through piles of electronic circuitry. As well as a large aquarium full of nanopythons.   What I need is a nymphomaniac.  He removes a tarp from a large, rectangular, metallic tank with a circular window in the middle of it.  Clear, plastic tubing, which branches into hundreds of increasingly smaller and smaller branches, floats in electrified fluid. The tubing is a synthetic human nervous system.    Reilly turns to Lindenmeyer.   Where's the Sheila 3.2 module?  Lindenmeyer hands him the labelless character module. Reilly opens the \"incubator.\"    Lindenmeyer and Reilly look on through the circular window.   It feeds on what is basically amniotic fluid.  In eight hours, we are going to have ourselves one hell of a play toy.  Off Lindenmeyer's wicked, but somewhat anxious, smile, we    Reilly paces anxiously by the incubator eight hours later.  Lindenmeyer sits off to the side, looking no less anxious.  It's close to 4:00 AM.    The human form inside incubator opens the hatch. Steam pours out from within its confines as it climbs out slowly.  The figure stands within the mist, admiring itself. Then its surroundings.  Reilly approaches the figure with the expectancy of a father about to see his newborn child for the first time. Lindenmeyer hangs back.    Baby, what I'm gonna do to you...  His face drops when Sid 6.7 steps out of the mist.  Completely naked. Lindenmeyer smiles proudly. Fearfully. Wickedly.    Who the hell is this?!    This... isn't.. .possible!",
        "SID": "I'm going to rehearse with your friend a while, then I'll be back to perform a new piece with you.  He grabs his bowling bag and SLAMS it into John's head, knocking him out. Sid 6.7 puts John's unconscious body over his shoulder.   If you get hungry, I'd recommend the escargot. They're delicious.  He carries John and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen. Parker scrambles to his gun, and races after Sid 6.7.    Parker charges through SOUS CHEFS chopping vegetables, who work undistracted. The Vegetables look plastic.  Parker turns a corner, stopping fast. At the other end of the aisle stands Sid 6.7, who presses his gun against the head of a frightened BUSBOY. Sid 6.7 holds the Busboy's body in front of his own as a shield.   Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?  Advancing up the aisle, Parker levels his gun at Sid 6.7 with his good arm. Now, all work comes to a stop as the Sous Chefs watch the showdown.   . You and me aren't so different, after all...  Parker again pulls the trigger. Click. Click, click. No bullets.   Like a violin without strings...  He takes off around the corner. Grabbing another clip from inside his uniform, Parker goes after him. Only to stumble over something. Sid 6.7's bowling bag. Blood flows through its zipper. You now realize the object inside is NOT a bowling ball.  Beside the bowling bag lies John's body, which is convulsing. His hands have been tied to bare electrical wire. John is being electrocuted. Parker kicks away the wires, but not in time.   I told you I was going to perform a new piece with you. It's called, \"First You Suffer, Then You Die.\" Hope you like it.  Parker gags, unable to breathe. He then starts to DE MATERIALIZE from within Sid 6.7's grasp.    NOOOH! You can't take him, yet. I'm not finished!  John's body also dematerializes as Parker disappears entirely.  The blood seeping from Sid 6.7's wound stops flowing and starts retracting into his body. Along with his bone fragments. His shoulder is healing itself. Right before your very eyes. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is    a/k/a LETAC. The facility is a converted aerospace research building in Pacoima. Funded by government black book dollars.  The look is a mixture of industrial grime and high-tech sparkle. Banks upon banks of computer equipment. Wires, cables, conduits, connectors everywhere you look.  In complete disarray to the uninitiated. But to those in the know, this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the world.  The building is partitioned into dozens of stations. At each station, a leading engineer in his field is frantically readying a prototype for demonstration. Each new technology designed to help fight the new Cold War... the War on Crime.  The atmosphere is competitive. Voices are loud. Tension, anticipation in the air. Only a lucky few will have their inventions approved for production.  LETAC is, quite simply, Los Alamos from 1940 meets Sega from 1994.  At a station in the middle of the room, TWO UNCONSCIOUS BODIES lie on narrow beds wearing form-fitting skull caps made of polyurethane.  Each skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through it at points designated as neural primes. Each needle is directly connected to the participant's nervous system.  The tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic wire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers surrounding the beds.  Each of these components isn't much to look at on its own. But together, with the rest of the apparatus, are part of something very new  a revolutionary law enforcement training device whose name you read:    The building is heavily-guarded. Razor wire, land mines, armed sentries. Nobody who shouldn't be here gets anywhere near here.  Cox leads Parker by the arm to a waiting prison transport. The two guards walk behind at a distance. Two more by the transport. The chain between Parker's legs keeps his steps short.    Cold metal benches. No windows. Parker climbs in, the only passenger. He looks out the open doors to Cox.    Standing outside the transport, Cox puts his hand on Parker's shoulder.    Parker sits in DARKNESS as the transport begins its trek. The only light comes from a four inch portal, covered in steel mesh, through which the Guards can keep an eye on him.    Sid 6.7 remains visible on the various monitors around the room as Lindenmeyer spot checks the simulator.    Don't be angry with me, Daryl.   Should I have?    Hey, Wallace, you really think you can shut me down?  Wallace stops, staring at a monitor in disbelief.    Wallace walks toward the building's entrance. His footsteps ECHO. His cellular phone RINGS.    As a matter of fact, little man, you're wrong. I think, therefore, I am.  Click. Sid 6.7 hangs-up. Wallace stops, staring at his phone in disbelief.    Parker is led into the Inmate Receiving Room at gunpoint. He is ordered to remove his clothing.  He stands completely naked, arms held out to the sides, as he is strip searched. Every portion of the body in which someone could hide something is closely inspected.  Without being graphic, we watch the dehumanizing procedure. He opens his mouth as wide as possible. Pulls his earlobes foreword to reveal behind them. Then bends over, hands on the floor in front of him.  He is scanned with a metal detector. So is his clothing, which is then returned to him.    Parker eats at a table with a dozen other inmates. The food is unrecognizable. The air thick with humidity and cigarette smoke. Nobody is talking. Just staring. At Parker.  Parker forces down the remainder of his meal, then returns his utensils to a bin. And heads to the bathroom. All eyes following Parker's every move.  The other inmates then turn their attentions to a man of incredible size following Parker. 6' 6\", 255 lbs. His face covered with red scar tissue from burns suffered long ago. This is BIG RED. He follows Parker into the bathroom.    Graffiti covers the walls. Red uses a stained urinal, then turns to the stalls. A pair of prisonissue shoes and socks are visible beneath one of them.    The room isn't clean. The technology is outdated. A large, female NURSE applies epoxy-like sealant to the synthetic skin on Parker's fingers.    Lindenmeyer storms in angrily. Sid 6.7 is visible on the virtual reality monitors around the simulator. He's giving himself a manicure.   True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.    It was me, what?   I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.   Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.   I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?  Lindenmeyer arches an eyebrow, then picks up a phone and dials an extension.    Reilly runs his perspiring finger over the monitor as if he could touch the contours of Sheila 3.2's body.   She's some of your finest work, Daryl.   You catching my drift?    Reilly turns to Lindenmeyer.    Reilly inserts the module into the gelatinous base of the synthetic nervous system.  The polymer neural net instantly crackles with life. It grows around the module. Cells  immediately begin adhering to the tubing. Forming the beginnings of a skeletal architecture.    Lindenmeyer and Reilly look on through the circular window.    It's night. Light is dim. His bed is empty. The wall next to it is completely bare, except for the five Christmas cards sent each year by Chief Cox.  The other two walls in the cell, however, look very different. They are completely covered with primitive paintings  darkly colored, surreal images. Imagine the Lascaux cave paintings as worksinprogress. Painted by Dali. Except these images were created by Parker Barnes.  He kneels in a corner, working intensely on another image. Completely lost in concentration. His hands, his clothing, covered in paint. He almost appears to be part of the art work.  The work is intricate. It clearly takes Parker a very long time. Which gives him something to do during the nights he is unable to sleep. Which is most of them.  He is so absorbed in his task that he seems oblivious to the constant taunts ECHOING throughout the cell block. Threats of the ugliest, most vile kind. The kind Parker has had to live with every night for the last five years.  Pausing to admire his work, Parker finally hears the taunts.  His face becoming a mixture of frustration, guilt, and anger.  Parker immediately resumes painting.    Reilly paces anxiously by the incubator eight hours later.  Lindenmeyer sits off to the side, looking no less anxious.  It's close to 4:00 AM.    The human form inside incubator opens the hatch. Steam pours out from within its confines as it climbs out slowly.  The figure stands within the mist, admiring itself. Then its surroundings.  Reilly approaches the figure with the expectancy of a father about to see his newborn child for the first time. Lindenmeyer hangs back.   My name is Sid. Sid 6.7.  He extends his hand as if to shake. Then grabs Reilly by the throat and chokes him. Hard.     What do you expect me to do, thank him?   Sure it is - and it's all thanks to the many long hours put in by you and Daryl.  He watches Reilly's face with curiosity as the life drains from it. A puddle forms beneath him. He drops Reilly's body to the floor.    ) Real instruments are so much more responsive than virtual ones, don't you think?  Lindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen. The office door is unlocked, and open. Watching Sid 6.7's expression, you realize something isn't quite right.  His expression is exaggerated. Artificial. Only for a moment, but it's enough to remind you Sid 6.7 is not human.  The billions of nanomechanisms which make up his anatomy are still learning to function in a fully-coordinated fashion. Sid 6.7 is, literally, getting used to his new skin.  In various ways throughout his \"life\"  be it a wandering eye, or a momentary limp - you will be reminded that Sid 6.7 is a synthetic nanoorganism unlike anyone has ever seen.  A surgical knife by the aquarium catches Sid 6.7's attention. Picking up the knife, he runs his finger across the razor sharp knife blade. Cutting himself slightly. A drop of blood appears. Sid 6.7 tastes his  blood.   Tastes different, somehow.  He then watches with interest as his wound regenerates, healing itself. The scar tissue is slightly off color.   I think I'm going to like it here.  Glancing at Reilly's prone body, he then SLAMS the office door in our face.    6:00 AM. Parker, clearly just awakened, is led into the room by a guard, who then exits. Waiting for Parker are Chief of Police Cox and Elizabeth Deane.    Parker lies on an operating table, receiving anesthesia, as a SURGEON drills a small hole into his skull. The surgeon inserts a minute, fiber-optic camera into the hole.  Parker's brain is displayed on a monitor. The surgeon uses the image to guide him as he carefully inserts the locater implant into Parker's brain.    Cox and Deane watch the operation through a large window.  Madison enters, carrying a folder labelled:INMATE #673429 A/K/A PARKER BARNES. She withdraws several PHOTOGRAPHS from the folder, placing the first one in front of Deane.    As Parker continues dreaming, the locater implant in his head is tested. Parker's location is pinpointed on an electronic map to within one inch of his present location. The hole in his skull is then stitched shut.    Parker presents his identification to a GUARD, then drives through the final checkpoint. Madison reviews Lindenmeyer's file.    Parker gets out of the car. Madison follows suit.    Investigators analyze the crime scene extensively with every device imaginable. Parker and Madison survey the scene with nothing but their eyes.  Lying in the middle of the living room are the four victims:  the affluent couple and the first two cops to arrive. Their bodies were left in similar condition to Reilly's. Except their heads have been interchanged.  Parker and Madison turn their attention to a message written in blood on a wall. It reads: DEATH TO THE PIGS.    in Culver City. Magic hour. Parker pulls the squad car into a space across the street. Hitting the vehicle parked in front of them. In which two UNDERCOVER COPS sit waiting to see if Lindenmeyer returns. Parker waves apologetically.    Madison races through the broken front door to find Parker checking his weapon. Before she can speak, he motions for Madison to freeze and be silent.  Parker hears Something. Something moving inside the duplex. His every movement is now that of a predator.  Madison awkwardly removes her own weapon from her purse. She does not handle it with confidence. Parker shakes his head.    It's as if the Information Superhighway ended in here. Cluttered stockpiles of hardware and software: computers, books, folders, disks, and tapes.  What you notice, however, is that ALL THE DATA relates to DIFFERENT KINDS of CRIMINALS: serial killers, mass murderers, terrorists, kidnappers, rapists, bombers, extortionists, anarchists, you name it, it's here. The psychology of, the methodology of, the history of, the encyclopedia of, the autobiographies of human villainy.  CLASSICAL MUSIC and lifelike SOUND EFFECTS can be heard coming from a computer. This is what Parker has been hearing. He holsters his sidearm. So does Madison. Who checks her pulse.    Looking around the room, Madison shakes her head.    Madison stares at the computer screen in awe. Parker flips through CD-ROM hard copies of the different versions of Sid.    being inserted into a disc drive inside the Cal Tech Computer Lab. Very high-tech. Sitting at the computer is ALEXIEV BORGEN, 60s, the \"grand old wizard\" of the facility. Parker and Madison sit next to him. Around them, young Lindenmeyers are everywhere.    The Dahmer part of me wants to boil you for dinner. The Manson part wants to recruit you to become part of my family.  You know what the Berkowitz part of me wants to do?  He raises the gun, placing it against the steamed window. But does NOT pull the trigger. His face going through a rapid change of expression  as if a battle for control of his emotions were going on.  Regaining control, Sid 6.7 lowers the gun. He stands back. Reflecting.   Craft can only become art when the creator sets his sights on something never yet achieved...  Like an apprentice about to become a master, the imitator is about to become an originator.  He pockets his weapon and walks    The bartender is a low-tech ROBO-TENDER. PATRONS sit quietly, drinking themselves into oblivion. Sid 6.7 takes a seat next to an BUSINESSMAN slumped at the bar.    Ever have one of those days where you decide something important about yourself? You know, where you say, \"I'm not just what I've been programmed to be. I can do what I want, when I want, how I want, because I'm my own person?\"   Just a soul on a personal journey. What I've realized is that I'm capable of anything. I have to start expanding my horizons...  The Robo-Tender rolls over to Sid 6.7.   To think you constitute one of my ancestors  He shoots the RoboTender between his mechanical eyes. The businessman smiles, like he's thought about doing exactly the same thing.   You know, you're absolutely right.  Would you mind sitting over there?  He points to a table with several other BUSINESSMEN.   Every orchestra is divided into sections. Like instruments sit with like instruments. Now be a good instrument and sit with your kind...  He lifts the businessman off his bar stool and carries him to the table.    Parker drives through a residential neighborhood. 9 PM. Madison points to a house on the right.    Madison walks up the steps to the front porch. She is immediately intercepted by her daughter, KARIN, 7, who bursts out of the front door and leaps into her arms.    Madison sits at a desk, typing quickly at a computer. Via modem, she connects with the L. A. P. D. Criminal Library. She rifles through data concerning MATHEW GRIMES, who was the leader of a cult of cyber anarchists. He was known as the Charles Manson of technological terrorism.    Madison stares gravely into the screen.    Parker and Karin continue staring at each other in silence. He smiles. Then she smiles. She wiggles her nose. Then so does he.  Madison comes out wearing fresh clothing, then kisses her daughter good night. As Madison goes to the squad car, Karin waves good-bye to Parker. He does the same. Karin's babysitter then leads her back inside the house.    Madison gets in, immediately noticing the handcuffs dangling from the steering wheel. Parker has been free the entire time.    Sid 6.7 has separated the patrons into four separate groups: older men and woman, and younger men and woman. All are frozen in their seats with fear.  Sid 6.7 points his gun at one group, then another, waving his arm as if he were a conductor, and as if his gun were a baton. Sid 6.7 clearly enjoys this game of terror. He delights in the patrons' fear, and revels in his power over them.   Good... Very good... Nice...  You -- in the middle -- don't hold back. Give it to me!  He fires his gun just above her head. She SCREAMS in terror.   That's better...  He continues aiming his gun from face to face, seeking ever increasing emotional responses from his \"instruments.\" A guy entering the bar does a quick about face. Gone by the time Sid 6.7 glances at the door.   God, I hate interruptions.   Once again, from the top BOOM! He shoots again, just missing a man's foot.    Parker drinks his coffee black. Madison adds two creams, two sugars. The cackling from the police radio continues unabated.    Sid 6.7 gently caresses the hair of a terrified young WOMAN sitting among several others. You hear the sound of tires SCREECHING to a halt outside.  Sid 6.7 remains unconcerned. He toys with the Woman, pointing the gun in her face, then pulling it back. Her expression changes instantly. Dramatically.   I just love how responsive you are.    The ushers were not supposed to seat you until intermission.   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you've been a real pleasure...  As he walks toward the exit, he admires himself in the mirror behind the bar. Sid 6.7 has never seen his own image in the real world before. He likes what he sees.    Street traffic is much lighter here. Sid 6.7 exits, getting into the vacant police car left by the cops.    Sid 6.7 adjusts his seat. The rearview mirror. Glancing at himself. Then behind him.    Sid 6.7 looks pleased.   Well, look who it...  CRACK! A bullet spiderwebs the rear window. Sid 6.7 punches the gas, taking off in a hurry.    Parker races after Sid 6.7, firing his weapon continuously. WITHOUT CARE for the innocent MOTORISTS nearby. They SCREAM in absolute terror, but remain unharmed. Physically, anyway.  Parker gives up the chase of Sid 6.7's vehicle and runs in the other direction. Toward Madison as she rounds the corner in their squad car.    He opens the driver's side door and shoves Madison over.    Parker's eyes are locked to the road with fierce determination. Madison's eyes are a mixture of fear and excitement. She holds onto the door handle for dear life.    ) Glad to see you're on the case, Officer Barnes. Or should I say, inmate 673429...    Sid 6.7 drives dangerously fast, causing an accident, around which Parker must circumnavigate. Tires SCREECH. Glass SHATTERS. Sid 6.7 hangs his head out the window.    The symphony of collision...   I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common  we have such history together I've been thinking we should become friends.  Madison's anxiety tanks are hitting capacity.   Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?  Parker glances at his mechanical hands gripping the wheel. Madison can't believe he is able to carry on a conversation while driving like this.   Who else do you know who's been locked out of the real world for years, and is now just learning to be free?  Who else do you know is a multiple murderer just like you? Who else...  Madison clicks off the radio.    My badge is in my jacket. Left pocket.   God, some people are stupid.  He aims his weapon at Parker's oncoming vehicle.    Madison leans out the window, aiming her gun at Sid 6.7, as Parker speeds toward the gridlock.    in the L. A. P. D. Downtown Headquarters the next morning. Chief Cox stares angrily at Parker. Madison sits next to him. Behind them is a mirrored wall.    Wallace and Deane look on through the twoway mirror. Deane is on the phone.    The TV is one of many mounted above the checkout counters. CUSTOMERS waiting in line with their shopping carts watch the news with varying degrees of horror, disgust, curiosity, and fear.  The stronger their reaction, the more Sid 6.7 enjoys it. He is waiting in line holding a box of Twinkies.    So was I.  Off the cashier's look, we    walking along a sidewalk. Noon. Something in a store front catches his attention. Namely, his own image being captured by a video camera pointed at the sidewalk. He is standing outside a large electronics store.  Sid 6.7 walks closer to the window, moving into a CLOSEUP.  He is captivated by his image. Fascinated. And intrigued.  This is the first time he has ever seen himself on screen.    Dozens of TVs on display. There is a different channel on each. The audio/visual bombardment is overwhelming. Sid 6.7 enters, making his way to a big screen TV with the local news in progress.    Don't you two make a pretty couple.  The news broadcast zooms in on Parker's picture. Sid 6.7 wiggles his synthetic fingers in front of his face.   We really do have so much in common. But I refuse to be upstaged...  He changes the channel back to the first news broadcast. A reporter stands amid the chaos outside the bar where Sid 6.7 had terrified the patrons.  Sid 6.7 turns to the other CUSTOMERS in the store. Most of them are watching other channels. He goes over to a control pad on a counter and presses several buttons.  Now EVERY TV in the store has the news with the reporter outside the bar on. A SKINHEAD, sporting numerous Nazi swastika tattoos, manually changes the channel on one of the TVs to a Dodger baseball game.  Sid 6.7 walks over to the Skinhead and changes the channel back to the news.    Take me out to the ball game... Take me out for the fun...  He places his hands on the Skinhead's head and efficiently snaps his head around, breaking his neck.   Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack... I don't care if I ever come back...  He drops the Skinhead to the floor, never once taking his eyes off the TV.    Sid 6.7 watches the TV intently, completely ignoring the horrified customers circling around him because of the dead Skinhead at his feet. A SALESMAN, who'd been demonstrating a videocamera, tapes Sid 6.7 from behind a customer.    I'm sorry I can't do more for you.  Public service really isn't my forte.  He walks into an EXTREME CLOSE-UP and kisses the lense. Then reaches out of frame to help the increasinglyshaky salesman steady the camera.   But rest assured...  A star is born.  WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL you're now watching a recording of Sid 6.7 on videotape, along with Parker, Madison, and a dozen other COPS, inside the Electronics Store an hour later. The tape is rewound.    But rest assured...  A star is born.    He grabs a police radio from a nearby OFFICER.    On the massive screen over left field, the Woman in CLOSE-UP looks embarrassed, trying to forget her face is now 40 feet high for all the other fans to see.    The Woman's face appears on various monitors. The phone RINGS. No one answers it. The room appears to be empty.  The stadium's closed-circuit TV director is not in his chair.  He's lying dead on the floor.    enjoys the reactions of the terrified fans around him as he chokes the life out of the Woman.    Hey, Parker, this one's for you...  His words ECHO around the stadium as he SNAPS the Woman's neck. He then hurls her limp body toward several men as they charge him.   That's all, folks.  He leaps over a railing, rushing into a tunnel which leads out of the seating area.    People bolt through the turnstiles, running away from the stadium as L. A. P. D. squad cars approach in the distance. The car in the lead is Parker's.    Parker speeds dangerously fast toward the fans streaming onto the street. Madison braces herself.    Parker comes within inches of mowing down several people, who keep right on running. Parker jumps out of the vehicle, scanning faces. In predator mode. Madison gets out, clearly shaken. Parker locks his gaze on somebody in the distance.    Parker and Madison hop the turnstiles. Only to be stopped by a remotecontrolled, boxshaped robotic sentry, which is identical to one you have seen before. This sentry was one of Reilly's creations at LETAC.    What's wrong, convict, your arms need adjusting? Or maybe it's your head. Maybe you aren't ready to be back out in the real world, yet...    Madison looks in both directions as she gets off the escalator. Parker is nowhere to be seen.  Moving toward her slowly is the wounded college student, who clutches his bleeding shoulder. He is shivering. Going into shock. Madison goes to him, taking off his headphones.    30 minutes later. The chaos outside Dodger Stadium has subsided. Madison and two PARAMEDICS lead the bandaged College Student to an ambulance.  Madison goes to Parker, who sits quietly by himself. Elbows on his knees. Head between his hands. Staring at the cement between his feet.    Hey, Parker, this one's for you... Hey, Parker, this one's for you...  As Parker raises his head slowly, you realize you are looking at the face of a wild animal. Eyes rabid. Jaw clenched. Pure anger. Violence about to erupt. Without fear. Without guilt. The beast within has been unleashed.    Cox and Madison head back toward L. A. P. D. Headquarters. They are in midconversation:    Parker sits alone in the darkness. Motionless. Until the sound of TWO GUNSHOTS piercing the transport's front windshield SHATTERS the silence.    Hey, old buddy, old pal, good to see you again.    Parker goes absolutely berserk. Viciously punching the steel mesh which separates them until the synthetic skin on his knuckles is shredded.   Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.   I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?    You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.  Parker is completely spent. Mentally and physically. He slumps in a corner. Out of breath. Bleeding. Sore. All he can do is stare out through the portal's mesh at Sid 6.7.   You could say thankyou, you know? I'm giving you your freedom, short lived though it may be.  A little known fact about the locater implants prison inmates now receive upon release is that they contain a pinhead capsule of neural toxin. The satellite they use to track you can also trigger release of the toxin with microwaves. After transmission, the implant's host dies within 30 seconds.  It won't take long for them to get your termination authorized once they learn of your escape. Now who would you rather go after, killer, them or me?  He releases the rear door lock.    An AIDE rushes through the door to Cox, who's briefing Deane and Wallace on what he has learned.    Madison enters wearily, late afternoon. Exhausted from the events of the last two days, she starts to undress. Her clothing is filthy. So is her skin. She could use a good shower, and a better massage.  Madison examines the various cuts and bruises she's received along the way. Not exactly war wounds, but to somebody used to sitting behind a desk, they are.  She absentmindedly turns on the television, then goes into her bathroom. Madison looks at her face in the mirror. She's looked better. After splashing cold water on her face, she comes to the same conclusion.  Madison takes two aspirin. And then two more. Wishing they would take effect immediately. Finally hearing the news on the TV, her entire demeanor changes instantly.  Madison rushes in front of the television to see a report of Parker's escape from the prison transport.    Ignoring the warnings of several COPS walking toward their vehicles, Madison speeds toward the front entrance. She barely stops in time. SCREEEECH!    Madison races through the bustling facility. Looking for somebody. She finally finds Cox coming out of his office.    The look on Cox's face tells you Madison has explained the situation to him. He is furious.    Cox leads in Madison and takes her to the subterranean power supply. He points to the floor's numerous circuit breakers.    The room is still under construction. Wallace stands behind a TECHNICIAN sitting at a console in front of a massive electronic map tracking several convicts, including Parker. The technician is typing in an elaborate termination code.    6 PM. The human FOREMAN presses a remote control detonator.  BOOM! An explosion occurs inside a building's foundation  . The building is levelled instantly.  Sid 6.7, who's been watching the explosion, approaches the Foreman.    Bravo.   Someone who appreciates the artistic value of highexplosives.  He shoots the Foreman in the chest. Sid 6.7 relieves him of his keys and heads to an explosives storage shed.    carrying a crate of C-4 high-explosives out of the shed in the construction sight minutes later. He adds it to the dozen crates already loaded in a truck. And takes off.    Sid 6.7 secures several crates of C4 to an automated sewer cleaning vehicle. He schedules its start time  24 hours from now. It is now 7:45 PM. The bomb's TIMER is set to detonate 15 minutes into the vehicle's journey -- at 8:00 PM tomorrow night.    You think you know me, but you don't have any idea who I really am...    sight of Mayor Bennett's upcoming Re-Election Rally, Cox supervises an army of L. A. P. D. officers who are securing the area. Bombsniffing dogs. Rooftop snipers. Helicopter surveillance. Nothing is being left to chance.  Anyone doing anything within 100 yards of the building is searched, including the REPORTERS and their CAMERA CREWS covering the convention's security.   Be a reporter  figure it out for yourself. All I'm going to tell you is that at 8:00 tomorrow night, I will become legendary...    Brings back memories, doesn't it?    I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you    Parker dives onto the sidewalk, avoiding the speeding van by inches. Getting to his feet, he launches himself up and over the railing...   I have to tell you, I do enjoy you, Parker. I really don't want to have to kill you...  The sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck.   Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.    Parker quickly explains the situation to the sanitation worker while Madison motions Lindenmeyer into the cab with her gun. As Parker climbs up to her, Madison shuts the door to give them a moment of privacy.   I have to tell you, I do enjoy you, Parker. I really don't want to have to kill you...  The sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck.  Parker and Sid 6.7 battle next to the compactor's lethal jaws. The machine makes an awful, grinding sound. Not unlike the sounds Parker and Sid 6.7 are making. The fight is primal. Savage. And moving at 30 miles-perhour.   Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.    My...secret.  He SLAMS the back of his head into Parker's nose. Breaking it. Parker reels back in pain.  Sid 6.7 squeezes out from within the steel teeth. The jagged metal cutting into him, striping him with blood. The blood then begins to retract. Sid 6.7's wounds, once again, heal themselves.   Too bad you can't regenerate...  As the truck slows at an intersection, he jumps to the street. Parker goes after him. Still in excruciating pain. WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is    Parker lies unconscious on a bed. He is connected to the simulator via the neural connectors in the polyurethane skull cap, just like he was before.  The Sid 6.7 character module is plugged into the system's main console. Lindenmeyer sits at the controls. Madison next to him, her gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head.  They are both watching Parker chase Sid 6.7 on the monitor in front of them. Parker continues experiencing intolerable pain. A clock reads 4:00 AM. They are the only ones inside the entire facility.    The place is a sevenstory mecca of shopping. An atrium allows you to look from the ground floor up to the seventh. Sid 6.7 rushes up the escalators. Going up to the second floor. Then the third.  Parker follows suit climbing escalator after escalator.  Throwing people out of his way.   (surprised at Parker's ruthlessness We really aren't that different, are we?  What he cannot see is that behind the column, Affluent Shopper 2.1 is Auto Resetting. Parker puts his gun to the shopper's head.    The sense of momentum is exhilarating. And terrifying. If you get dizzy easily, close your eyes.   Man, what a rush.  Adios, amigo!  Grabbing his gun, he takes off out of the lobby.    Madison and Lindenmeyer watch Parker on screen. Madison still has her gun trained on Lindenmeyer, who notices a WARNING LIGHT start to flash. He turns to Parker's unconscious body lying on the bed. Lindenmeyer looks concerned.    Parker races out the door. BOOM! That was left knee cap. He tumbles to the street. His gun flying from his hand.  Parker crawls desperately toward his weapon. But not fast enough. Sid 6.7 arrives at the weapon first.   So close, and yet, so far...  He kicks the weapon down the sidewalk, then points his gun at Parker's head.   It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.    You know, I do want you to see it.  He shoots Parker in his other knee cap, rendering both of his legs useless.   I want you to have a bird's eye view...    A 67 story monument to engineering brilliance in this land of earthquakes. 6:30 PM.   There you go  best seat in the house.   Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally...  He walks toward an open stairway door behind them.   I've got some final preparations to take care of Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.    Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.   I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!  His body DISINTEGRATES before your eyes. It's electronic particles form into an amorphous cloud. Which disappears from view.    Parker's screams for help ECHO throughout the facility. But there is no one there to hear him.    The garbage truck is parked in a loading dock. Lindenmeyer climbs awkwardly onto the truck, then into the compactor.    Lindenmeyer wades through trash until he comes upon Sid 6.7's headless body. The polymer neural net visible within its neck. Lindenmeyer inserts Sid 6.7's character module into its gelatinous base. But nothing happens.    Madison, still unconscious on the floor, finally stirs. Maybe Parker's screaming is finally reaching her. Or at least, starting to.    Lindenmeyer looks on with awe as Sid 6.7 grows a new head right before your eyes. You've never seen anything like it.  Sid 6.7's resulting head is slightly off center. His skin tone isn't perfect, nor is his color, but at least its functional. Sid 6.7 admires himself in a broken mirror.   I am beautiful, aren't I?   How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?   Glad to...  He reaches out to give Lindenmeyer a hand, then grabs him by the throat. Choking him. Lindenmeyer can't believe what is happening.   You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?    Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...  As Lindenmeyer begins to scream, we    Madison forces herself into consciousness.- Or as close to it as she can get. Her expression is one of complete and utter terror.   Dr. Carter  I've been hoping we'd get a moment together...  Mustering her strength, she manages to crawl behind several of the computers which make up the simulator. Sid 6.7 advances calmly toward her.   You know so much about me, I was hoping to learn a little bit about you. You see, I'm doing research, too...  He looks behind the computers where you last saw Madison.  She is no longer there. Sid 6.7 begins searching for her.  He passes a virtual reality monitor on which Parker can be seen clinging for life.    Hang in there, Parker.  On the monitor, Parker looks all around him, trying to determine the voice's origin.  Madison crawls out of Lindenmeyer's station. Sid 6.7 just catches sight of her, and goes after her.    Madison crawls into a darkened engineer's station and hides. She is still very dizzy. And trying to keep the sound of her breathing to a minimum.  Sid 6.7 enters quietly. A hunter on the prowl. Moving very slowly. Then lunging very swiftly. He continues the hunt.  If Madison is discovered, she doesn't have a prayer. Her heart pounds. Her forehead perspires. Sid 6.7 is getting closer.  Sid 6.7 checks inside closets. Cabinets. Anywhere large enough for a human being to fit. He is practically standing over her. Looking. Listening.   How does it feel to know you're going to die? What are you thinking about?  Lights in the building suddenly come on. Several engineers can be heard entering. It's 8 AM  the start of a new day. The facility is quickly becoming populated.  After giving one last look around, Sid 6.7 reluctantly gives up the hunt, and exits. Madison does not move until she is certain Sid 6.7 has left the building.    Madison keeps pressing the return button over and over, making sure it worked. Parker's eyes flutter as he returns to consciousness. Madison rushes to him.    Elizabeth Deane picks up the phone.    The area has been converted into a security checkpoint.  Entrants are carefully scanned onebyone. WE HEAR the rally   Security is on extreme alert. Tension is very high. It's 7:00. Parker, Madison, and Deane look on, anxiously. They listen to a RADIO SCANNER monitoring the conversations between the demolitions teams.    A threeman demolition team slowly, carefully disarms the bomb Sid 6.7 had secured to the automated sewer cleaning vehicle. Snip. One wire at a time. Snip.  The work is very delicate. Snip. One wrong move and it's all over. Snip.    Parker, Madison, and Deane remain glued to their scanner.    The Team Leader carefully removes a piece of paper which had been taped to the timing mechanism. Written in handwriting, you read: HEY, PARKER, THE FUN IS ONLY STARTING!    Deane stares at Parker with disbelief. Deane's Aide, holding a cellular phone, approaches Parker.    Alexiev Borgen sits with a dismantled MAESTRO keyboard in front of him.    The members of the L. A. Philharmonic tune-up for the evening's payperview extravaganza. Several teenage musicians sit with them.  Lights, cameras, and production trucks are all over the place. This really is going to be one hell of a show.    who is dressed in a tuxedo, knocking on the door to Guest Conductor's Dressing Room.   It's show time.  He shoves the Guest Conductor back into his Dressing Room. Sid 6.7 follows him in, revealing a suppressed .38. He SLAMS the door behind him.    Madison speeds recklessly through traffic toward the Hollywood Bowl. Parker doesn't notice. He's totally focused on screaming into the police radio.    Madison SCREECHES the vehicle to a halt. She comes within inches of mowing down several people. Madison and Parker bolt to the entrance, flashing their badges to the guards.    The Guest Conductor's movements grow even more intense. More demanding. As he looks to the violin section, we now see the conductor's face. It is Sid 6.7.    Don't hold back...Give it to me. Give it to me!  The orchestra plays with everything they've got. They hit every note perfectly. Including a high C.    cannot believe his eyes. Or his ears. The entire orchestra has stopped.   Come on, play! PLAY!  In his rage, his face contorts \"past points\", which can only be described bizarre, frightening, and not, something you would ever like to see when you look in the mirror.  The musicians stare at Sid 6.7, and then at Parker and Madison with concerned, confused silence. Which is broken by Parker's gunfire.  Ducking behind the podium, Sid 6.7 desperately tries to rewire the sensors to trigger manually. Without luck. He takes his .38 out of his jacket and starts firing.  Pandemonium erupts throughout the Hollywood Bowl. Audience members run in every direction.  The members of the orchestra bolt for their very lives, but keep their instruments with them. Even the oboist.  Preventing Parker and Madison from taking any further shots at Sid 6.7.  Sid 6.7 bolts down into the crowd. Madison cannot get off a clean shot. Neither can Parker. He aims, but does NOT fire. He and Madison struggle through the crowd after him.    Parker and Madison just catch a glimpse of Sid 6.7 as he rushes up the entrance ramp to the Hollywood Freeway. Parker and Madison bolt after him.    You...ruined...I'M GOING TO KILL     You couldn't hit the side of a...  As he raises his twobyfour high over Parker's head, Madison pulls the trigger smoothly.  IN SLOW MOTION, you follow the bullet as it exits the barrel of her gun. And penetrates Sid 6.7's skull between the eyes and exits out the back of his head.  Sid 6.7 collapses on the ground next to Parker.",
        "6.7": "I'm going to rehearse with your friend a while, then I'll be back to perform a new piece with you.  He grabs his bowling bag and SLAMS it into John's head, knocking him out. Sid 6.7 puts John's unconscious body over his shoulder.   If you get hungry, I'd recommend the escargot. They're delicious.  He carries John and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen. Parker scrambles to his gun, and races after Sid 6.7.   Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?  Advancing up the aisle, Parker levels his gun at Sid 6.7 with his good arm. Now, all work comes to a stop as the Sous Chefs watch the showdown.   . You and me aren't so different, after all...  Parker again pulls the trigger. Click. Click, click. No bullets.   Like a violin without strings...  He takes off around the corner. Grabbing another clip from inside his uniform, Parker goes after him. Only to stumble over something. Sid 6.7's bowling bag. Blood flows through its zipper. You now realize the object inside is NOT a bowling ball.  Beside the bowling bag lies John's body, which is convulsing. His hands have been tied to bare electrical wire. John is being electrocuted. Parker kicks away the wires, but not in time.   I told you I was going to perform a new piece with you. It's called, \"First You Suffer, Then You Die.\" Hope you like it.  Parker gags, unable to breathe. He then starts to DE MATERIALIZE from within Sid 6.7's grasp.    NOOOH! You can't take him, yet. I'm not finished!  John's body also dematerializes as Parker disappears entirely.  The blood seeping from Sid 6.7's wound stops flowing and starts retracting into his body. Along with his bone fragments. His shoulder is healing itself. Right before your very eyes. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is    Don't be angry with me, Daryl.   Should I have?    Hey, Wallace, you really think you can shut me down?  Wallace stops, staring at a monitor in disbelief.    As a matter of fact, little man, you're wrong. I think, therefore, I am.  Click. Sid 6.7 hangs-up. Wallace stops, staring at his phone in disbelief.   True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.    It was me, what?   I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.   Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.   I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?  Lindenmeyer arches an eyebrow, then picks up a phone and dials an extension.   She's some of your finest work, Daryl.   You catching my drift?   My name is Sid. Sid 6.7.  He extends his hand as if to shake. Then grabs Reilly by the throat and chokes him. Hard.   What do you expect me to do, thank him?   Sure it is - and it's all thanks to the many long hours put in by you and Daryl.  He watches Reilly's face with curiosity as the life drains from it. A puddle forms beneath him. He drops Reilly's body to the floor.    ) Real instruments are so much more responsive than virtual ones, don't you think?  Lindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen. The office door is unlocked, and open. Watching Sid 6.7's expression, you realize something isn't quite right.  His expression is exaggerated. Artificial. Only for a moment, but it's enough to remind you Sid 6.7 is not human.  The billions of nanomechanisms which make up his anatomy are still learning to function in a fully-coordinated fashion. Sid 6.7 is, literally, getting used to his new skin.  In various ways throughout his \"life\"  be it a wandering eye, or a momentary limp - you will be reminded that Sid 6.7 is a synthetic nanoorganism unlike anyone has ever seen.  A surgical knife by the aquarium catches Sid 6.7's attention. Picking up the knife, he runs his finger across the razor sharp knife blade. Cutting himself slightly. A drop of blood appears. Sid 6.7 tastes his  blood.   Tastes different, somehow.  He then watches with interest as his wound regenerates, healing itself. The scar tissue is slightly off color.   I think I'm going to like it here.  Glancing at Reilly's prone body, he then SLAMS the office door in our face.    being inserted into a disc drive inside the Cal Tech Computer Lab. Very high-tech. Sitting at the computer is ALEXIEV BORGEN, 60s, the \"grand old wizard\" of the facility. Parker and Madison sit next to him. Around them, young Lindenmeyers are everywhere.    The Dahmer part of me wants to boil you for dinner. The Manson part wants to recruit you to become part of my family.  You know what the Berkowitz part of me wants to do?  He raises the gun, placing it against the steamed window. But does NOT pull the trigger. His face going through a rapid change of expression  as if a battle for control of his emotions were going on.  Regaining control, Sid 6.7 lowers the gun. He stands back. Reflecting.   Craft can only become art when the creator sets his sights on something never yet achieved...  Like an apprentice about to become a master, the imitator is about to become an originator.  He pockets his weapon and walks    Ever have one of those days where you decide something important about yourself? You know, where you say, \"I'm not just what I've been programmed to be. I can do what I want, when I want, how I want, because I'm my own person?\"   Just a soul on a personal journey. What I've realized is that I'm capable of anything. I have to start expanding my horizons...  The Robo-Tender rolls over to Sid 6.7.   To think you constitute one of my ancestors  He shoots the RoboTender between his mechanical eyes. The businessman smiles, like he's thought about doing exactly the same thing.   You know, you're absolutely right.  Would you mind sitting over there?  He points to a table with several other BUSINESSMEN.   Every orchestra is divided into sections. Like instruments sit with like instruments. Now be a good instrument and sit with your kind...  He lifts the businessman off his bar stool and carries him to the table.   Good... Very good... Nice...  You -- in the middle -- don't hold back. Give it to me!  He fires his gun just above her head. She SCREAMS in terror.   That's better...  He continues aiming his gun from face to face, seeking ever increasing emotional responses from his \"instruments.\" A guy entering the bar does a quick about face. Gone by the time Sid 6.7 glances at the door.   God, I hate interruptions.   Once again, from the top BOOM! He shoots again, just missing a man's foot.   I just love how responsive you are.    The ushers were not supposed to seat you until intermission.   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you've been a real pleasure...  As he walks toward the exit, he admires himself in the mirror behind the bar. Sid 6.7 has never seen his own image in the real world before. He likes what he sees.   Well, look who it...  CRACK! A bullet spiderwebs the rear window. Sid 6.7 punches the gas, taking off in a hurry.    ) Glad to see you're on the case, Officer Barnes. Or should I say, inmate 673429...    Sid 6.7 drives dangerously fast, causing an accident, around which Parker must circumnavigate. Tires SCREECH. Glass SHATTERS. Sid 6.7 hangs his head out the window.    The symphony of collision...   I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common  we have such history together I've been thinking we should become friends.  Madison's anxiety tanks are hitting capacity.   Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?  Parker glances at his mechanical hands gripping the wheel. Madison can't believe he is able to carry on a conversation while driving like this.   Who else do you know who's been locked out of the real world for years, and is now just learning to be free?  Who else do you know is a multiple murderer just like you? Who else...  Madison clicks off the radio.    My badge is in my jacket. Left pocket.   God, some people are stupid.  He aims his weapon at Parker's oncoming vehicle.    So was I.  Off the cashier's look, we    walking along a sidewalk. Noon. Something in a store front catches his attention. Namely, his own image being captured by a video camera pointed at the sidewalk. He is standing outside a large electronics store.  Sid 6.7 walks closer to the window, moving into a CLOSEUP.  He is captivated by his image. Fascinated. And intrigued.  This is the first time he has ever seen himself on screen.    Don't you two make a pretty couple.  The news broadcast zooms in on Parker's picture. Sid 6.7 wiggles his synthetic fingers in front of his face.   We really do have so much in common. But I refuse to be upstaged...  He changes the channel back to the first news broadcast. A reporter stands amid the chaos outside the bar where Sid 6.7 had terrified the patrons.  Sid 6.7 turns to the other CUSTOMERS in the store. Most of them are watching other channels. He goes over to a control pad on a counter and presses several buttons.  Now EVERY TV in the store has the news with the reporter outside the bar on. A SKINHEAD, sporting numerous Nazi swastika tattoos, manually changes the channel on one of the TVs to a Dodger baseball game.  Sid 6.7 walks over to the Skinhead and changes the channel back to the news.    Take me out to the ball game... Take me out for the fun...  He places his hands on the Skinhead's head and efficiently snaps his head around, breaking his neck.   Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack... I don't care if I ever come back...  He drops the Skinhead to the floor, never once taking his eyes off the TV.    I'm sorry I can't do more for you.  Public service really isn't my forte.  He walks into an EXTREME CLOSE-UP and kisses the lense. Then reaches out of frame to help the increasinglyshaky salesman steady the camera.   But rest assured...  A star is born.  WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL you're now watching a recording of Sid 6.7 on videotape, along with Parker, Madison, and a dozen other COPS, inside the Electronics Store an hour later. The tape is rewound.    But rest assured...  A star is born.    enjoys the reactions of the terrified fans around him as he chokes the life out of the Woman.    Hey, Parker, this one's for you...  His words ECHO around the stadium as he SNAPS the Woman's neck. He then hurls her limp body toward several men as they charge him.   That's all, folks.  He leaps over a railing, rushing into a tunnel which leads out of the seating area.    What's wrong, convict, your arms need adjusting? Or maybe it's your head. Maybe you aren't ready to be back out in the real world, yet...    Hey, Parker, this one's for you... Hey, Parker, this one's for you...  As Parker raises his head slowly, you realize you are looking at the face of a wild animal. Eyes rabid. Jaw clenched. Pure anger. Violence about to erupt. Without fear. Without guilt. The beast within has been unleashed.    Hey, old buddy, old pal, good to see you again.   Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.   I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?    You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.  Parker is completely spent. Mentally and physically. He slumps in a corner. Out of breath. Bleeding. Sore. All he can do is stare out through the portal's mesh at Sid 6.7.   You could say thankyou, you know? I'm giving you your freedom, short lived though it may be.  A little known fact about the locater implants prison inmates now receive upon release is that they contain a pinhead capsule of neural toxin. The satellite they use to track you can also trigger release of the toxin with microwaves. After transmission, the implant's host dies within 30 seconds.  It won't take long for them to get your termination authorized once they learn of your escape. Now who would you rather go after, killer, them or me?  He releases the rear door lock.    Bravo.   Someone who appreciates the artistic value of highexplosives.  He shoots the Foreman in the chest. Sid 6.7 relieves him of his keys and heads to an explosives storage shed.    carrying a crate of C-4 high-explosives out of the shed in the construction sight minutes later. He adds it to the dozen crates already loaded in a truck. And takes off.    You think you know me, but you don't have any idea who I really am...   Be a reporter  figure it out for yourself. All I'm going to tell you is that at 8:00 tomorrow night, I will become legendary...    Brings back memories, doesn't it?    I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you   I have to tell you, I do enjoy you, Parker. I really don't want to have to kill you...  The sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck.   Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.   I have to tell you, I do enjoy you, Parker. I really don't want to have to kill you...  The sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck.  Parker and Sid 6.7 battle next to the compactor's lethal jaws. The machine makes an awful, grinding sound. Not unlike the sounds Parker and Sid 6.7 are making. The fight is primal. Savage. And moving at 30 miles-perhour.   Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.    My...secret.  He SLAMS the back of his head into Parker's nose. Breaking it. Parker reels back in pain.  Sid 6.7 squeezes out from within the steel teeth. The jagged metal cutting into him, striping him with blood. The blood then begins to retract. Sid 6.7's wounds, once again, heal themselves.   Too bad you can't regenerate...  As the truck slows at an intersection, he jumps to the street. Parker goes after him. Still in excruciating pain. WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is   (surprised at Parker's ruthlessness We really aren't that different, are we?  What he cannot see is that behind the column, Affluent Shopper 2.1 is Auto Resetting. Parker puts his gun to the shopper's head.    The sense of momentum is exhilarating. And terrifying. If you get dizzy easily, close your eyes.   Man, what a rush.  Adios, amigo!  Grabbing his gun, he takes off out of the lobby.   So close, and yet, so far...  He kicks the weapon down the sidewalk, then points his gun at Parker's head.   It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.    You know, I do want you to see it.  He shoots Parker in his other knee cap, rendering both of his legs useless.   I want you to have a bird's eye view...   There you go  best seat in the house.   Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally...  He walks toward an open stairway door behind them.   I've got some final preparations to take care of Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.    Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.   I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!  His body DISINTEGRATES before your eyes. It's electronic particles form into an amorphous cloud. Which disappears from view.   I am beautiful, aren't I?   How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?   Glad to...  He reaches out to give Lindenmeyer a hand, then grabs him by the throat. Choking him. Lindenmeyer can't believe what is happening.   You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?    Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...  As Lindenmeyer begins to scream, we   Dr. Carter  I've been hoping we'd get a moment together...  Mustering her strength, she manages to crawl behind several of the computers which make up the simulator. Sid 6.7 advances calmly toward her.   You know so much about me, I was hoping to learn a little bit about you. You see, I'm doing research, too...  He looks behind the computers where you last saw Madison.  She is no longer there. Sid 6.7 begins searching for her.  He passes a virtual reality monitor on which Parker can be seen clinging for life.    Hang in there, Parker.  On the monitor, Parker looks all around him, trying to determine the voice's origin.  Madison crawls out of Lindenmeyer's station. Sid 6.7 just catches sight of her, and goes after her.   How does it feel to know you're going to die? What are you thinking about?  Lights in the building suddenly come on. Several engineers can be heard entering. It's 8 AM  the start of a new day. The facility is quickly becoming populated.  After giving one last look around, Sid 6.7 reluctantly gives up the hunt, and exits. Madison does not move until she is certain Sid 6.7 has left the building.    who is dressed in a tuxedo, knocking on the door to Guest Conductor's Dressing Room.   It's show time.  He shoves the Guest Conductor back into his Dressing Room. Sid 6.7 follows him in, revealing a suppressed .38. He SLAMS the door behind him.    Don't hold back...Give it to me. Give it to me!  The orchestra plays with everything they've got. They hit every note perfectly. Including a high C.    cannot believe his eyes. Or his ears. The entire orchestra has stopped.   Come on, play! PLAY!  In his rage, his face contorts \"past points\", which can only be described bizarre, frightening, and not, something you would ever like to see when you look in the mirror.  The musicians stare at Sid 6.7, and then at Parker and Madison with concerned, confused silence. Which is broken by Parker's gunfire.  Ducking behind the podium, Sid 6.7 desperately tries to rewire the sensors to trigger manually. Without luck. He takes his .38 out of his jacket and starts firing.  Pandemonium erupts throughout the Hollywood Bowl. Audience members run in every direction.  The members of the orchestra bolt for their very lives, but keep their instruments with them. Even the oboist.  Preventing Parker and Madison from taking any further shots at Sid 6.7.  Sid 6.7 bolts down into the crowd. Madison cannot get off a clean shot. Neither can Parker. He aims, but does NOT fire. He and Madison struggle through the crowd after him.    You...ruined...I'M GOING TO KILL     You couldn't hit the side of a...  As he raises his twobyfour high over Parker's head, Madison pulls the trigger smoothly.  IN SLOW MOTION, you follow the bullet as it exits the barrel of her gun. And penetrates Sid 6.7's skull between the eyes and exits out the back of his head.  Sid 6.7 collapses on the ground next to Parker.",
        "Madison": "The cuffs won't be necessary.   I would like the following three things in this order: your mouth shut, his cuffs off, and your ass outside the door. Any questions?  The Guard removes Parker's cuffs, then exits, taking up his post outside the door. The skin around Parker's wrists is blue where the cuffs dug into his skin.  Parker sits across from Madison. She places a microrecorder in the middle of the table and presses RECORD.    No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?   In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?   I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.   That's not true, Parker.    What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?   You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...   It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.    I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.   Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?   What's the assignment?    Quite an improvement.  Hair well above the collar standard, L. A. P. D. regulation.  What exactly am I going to be doing in the field?   This is Parker Barnes six years ago. The most decorated cop in the history of L. A. P. D. Special Investigations Division...  The photograph is in black and white. But as we MOVE IN CLOSER, it takes on color. As well as comes to life. Then distorting. Becoming surreal. Resembling one of the images from Parker's cell. Then mutating into something else.   This is Parker with his wife and daughter. Beautiful young family, weren't they?  The bright colors melt into darker, more brooding images. Flashes of men's faces. Melting into urban decay. Unhappiness. Technology.   This is the group of cyber anarchists Parker was closing in on.  Melancholy turns violent. Glimpses of weapons. Death. Explosions. Death. Blood. Death. Caskets. Tombstones. Images moving so fast, it's hard to tell what they are. Nothing literal.   This is what Parker's wife and daughter looked like after they were kidnapped and executed.  Weapons firing. Bombs exploding. Images of rage in all its forms. Many of which you've already seen. Making one thing now clear: the paintings in Parker's cell represent his life. What he was. What he lost. And what he is.   This is what the cyber anarchists and two people who just happened to be in the wrong club at the wrong time looked like after Parker finished with them.  Tears. Hopelessness. Detonation. And finally blackness. Complete and utter blackness.    Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.   The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.   What you need is a collar.    You remember how to get to Toluca Lake?  He glances at her, then stops the car.   What are you doing?!  He walks around the car, brushing past her. Then drops to his knees at the side of the road. He puts his hands in the dirt, feeling the earth between his fingers.   It wasn't a lie.   You all right?    You ready for this?    He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.   Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.   I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?    You drive well for somebody who hasn't done it in five years.  He ignores her as they get out of the car.   He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.   Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.  She approaches the cops, who remain in their car.   Any sign of Lindenmeyer?   Mind if we take a look inside?   Do what you've got to do.  So will I...    You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?    Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?   This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.   I'm still working on it.  Noticing something on the floor, she picks up a bizarre looking synthesizer keyboard off the floor. You read its name: MAESTRO.   Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?   The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.   (keeping her eyes on screen I am the demon from the bottomless pit...   I am impressed.   Who said that?    He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.   Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.   But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.  She continues opening the files of the higher versions of Sid. Version 5.9 consists of 67 different profiles. The visualized psychological battle is intense. And extremely violent. The 6.7 version, with 183 profiles, is even worse.   It's a good bet a couple of the dominant personalities teamed up to overpower the others.  The question is, which one of the dominants then finally managed to take control?  Attempting to open the files of the composite profiles, Madison discovers they are protected by encryption.    ) He'll let us see the ingredients that went in, but not how the soup turned out after stirring.  Madison scrolls through the list of 183 names, stopping at the name MATHEW GRIMES. Alarm registers on her face. As Parker comes over to look over her shoulder, she quickly scrolls through the list to get the name off the screen. He holds the Sid 6.7 CD-ROM in hand.   As a matter of fact, it is.  Parker points to a name on the screen:JEFFREY DAHMER.   Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.   In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...   Think you can get into the program?   Not this one, but the next one. The one with the bicycle out front...  Parker stops in front of a modest, but wellkept, house.   Give me your wrist.   And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.  Parker relents, and holds up his wrist. Madison places the cuff around it, then gets out of the car.    Madison walks up the steps to the front porch. She is immediately intercepted by her daughter, KARIN, 7, who bursts out of the front door and leaps into her arms.    Madison sits at a desk, typing quickly at a computer. Via modem, she connects with the L. A. P. D. Criminal Library. She rifles through data concerning MATHEW GRIMES, who was the leader of a cult of cyber anarchists. He was known as the Charles Manson of technological terrorism.   Grimes, you better not be the dominant.    Parker and Karin continue staring at each other in silence. He smiles. Then she smiles. She wiggles her nose. Then so does he.  Madison comes out wearing fresh clothing, then kisses her daughter good night. As Madison goes to the squad car, Karin waves good-bye to Parker. He does the same. Karin's babysitter then leads her back inside the house.   How did you get your hand out?  As she unlocks the handcuffs from the steering wheel, Parker wiggles his mechanical hand in front of her face.   I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.   Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.  She turns on the police radio.   I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.    Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.   Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.   What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.    buying two coffees from a downtown street vendor. She returns to the squad car, which is barely moving. Traffic is at a near standstill because of an accident.   You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...   Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...   I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.   That's only a couple blocks from here.    Don't get out of the car.   Parker! PARKER!  Shit!  She climbs into the driver's seat, spilling hot coffee on herself.   What the hell's going on?!    What did you do to those people?    Enjoying yourself?   This isn't a game, Parker!    That who I think it is?  Parker turns to her, then picks up the radio.   You have nothing in common.  She puts her hand to her wrist -- checking her pulse.   I'm doing the best I can!  BOOM! That was Sid 6.7 shooting their front left tire. Parker loses control of the vehicle.   Any sign of Lindenmeyer?   Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.    on the speakerphone inside Cox's Office.   Were you able to get into the program?   Let us know.    Whatever he was doing here was only the start.   I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished...  She moves closer to the screen as the tape is played back. Madison studies Sid 6.7 intently.    You mind playing that part again?  Her request is obliged.   Freeze it there  She stares at Sid 6.7, who is looking directly at her.    You've discovered media, haven't you? You like the attention...the power...You like being a star. What are you going to do next, star? What are you going to...  Her attention turns to the upper right corner of the screen, where onlookers are visible watching Sid 6.7. Their faces blurry. But even out of focus, it isn't hard to recognize Lindenmeyer.    You do like to watch, don't you?  If any of you are looking for Daryl Lindenmeyer, that's him...  She points to Lindenmeyer, then makes her way over to Parker, who's standing exactly where Sid 6.7 was when he killed the Skinhead. Parker does not look at Madison. His eyes are fixed on the TV in front of him.   It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.    Parker.. .Parker!  She does the best she can to follow after him. People knock into Parker as hard as he does them. A human version of bumper cars.  Reaching the entrance to the subway, Parker leaps down the escalator three steps at a time. Madison remains in his wake.   You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?   Which way?     leaps off the descending escalator on the southbound side and rushes to Parker.  She pulls Parker back just before the train reaches him. Had his arm still been raised, Parker would have lost his arm a second time.  They tumble to the floor. A PASSENGER rushes to Madison.    What were you shooting at?  Parker gets to his feet. Madison doesn't take her eyes off him.   Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you    lines up her shot. Hands shaking. With both fear and determination. Her finger presses down on the trigger...but she can't do it.   Dammit!  She chases after him.   Let me help you...  He collapses in her arms.    Call 9-1-1. Wait for me above ground.    Do you have any idea the trauma you put that kid through?!  Parker doesn't respond. All around them, a cacophony of news broadcasts is heard. From passing cars. From boom boxes. From portable TVs. Over and over, you hear what Sid 6.7 had said while killing the woman in Dodger Stadium:    No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!  She tries to grab him by the shoulders. Parker blocks her arms away.    What's going on?   Parker...  Parker shuts her up with a look. There is nothing that can be said. The prison transport doors are SLAMMED shut. The vehicle takes off.    I should have told him.   I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.   Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.    Madison enters wearily, late afternoon. Exhausted from the events of the last two days, she starts to undress. Her clothing is filthy. So is her skin. She could use a good shower, and a better massage.  Madison examines the various cuts and bruises she's received along the way. Not exactly war wounds, but to somebody used to sitting behind a desk, they are.  She absentmindedly turns on the television, then goes into her bathroom. Madison looks at her face in the mirror. She's looked better. After splashing cold water on her face, she comes to the same conclusion.  Madison takes two aspirin. And then two more. Wishing they would take effect immediately. Finally hearing the news on the TV, her entire demeanor changes instantly.  Madison rushes in front of the television to see a report of Parker's escape from the prison transport.   Oh, shit!  Grabbing a handful of clothes, she bolts urgently out the door.    speeding recklessly through city streets in her car. She doesn't stop for red lights. Not for grid-lock. Not for nothing.  She is also still finishing getting dressed.    There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.   I need your help--  Taking him by the arm, she leads him into an elevator going down just before its doors close.   I don't set policy.  You have the key?  He takes a security key out of his pocket and uses it to gain access to a subterranean floor.   Got it.   We know you didn't kill those guards.   He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.    How did you find out about the toxin?   You're not capable of it.   I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.  She means it. Parker turns away, looking at his wife's headstone.    survey the scene with binoculars from amid a crowd of pedestrians two blocks away. Both are disguised in hats and different clothing. You don't immediately recognize them.   The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?   Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.   If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.   That, or living through him...   I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...  She points to what she's looking at. Looking through his binoculars, he still can't see what she means. She helps him aim his binoculars.    Thanks.  They move briskly down the block toward the bridge. Quickly climbing a set of stairs.    reach the top of the stairs. Sid 6.7 remains on the phone, his back toward Parker and Madison. They split-up, winding their way through the crowd waiting for an arriving bus.  As the bus pulls to the stop, the awaiting passengers move toward the opening doors. Obscuring Parker's view of the payphone.  Parker shoves his way through the crowd, only to see Sid 6.7 holding Madison in front of him, his gun to her head. Parker trains his weapon at Sid 6.7. He doesn't have a clean shot.    I figured you'd show up sooner or later...    Find out anything?   Can I ask you something?    You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go  right now.  Why are you going to do this?    That's why I'm asking.    What's wrong with Parker?    Show me his physical sensory level.  She clicks back the hammer of her gun and presses the barrel against Lindenmeyer's ear. He does as told. On a panel by the console, you read: PARTICIPANT PHYSICAL SENSORY LEVEL: 670%.   Turn it down!  Lindenmeyer adjusts the sensory level back down to 100%.   What's wrong?  Lindenmeyer checks several readings on his console.   Talk so I can understand.   Then fix it.  As Lindenmeyer moves to Parker, Madison stays right with him. Her gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head. Lindenmeyer carefully removes one of the neural connectors from Parker's skull cap. Before removing another, he looks for a safe place to put the connector.    Lindenmeyer watches Parker scream on the monitor. Madison remains unconscious on the floor behind him.      of someone entering Lindenmeyer's station in LETAC. You can't tell who it is, at first. But you can see the person is male. And wearing Lindenmeyer's pants. You now see the person is Sid 6.7.   You okay?    More or less.   My guess is dead.   I don't know.  Several engineers peek in curiously at them.   Let's get out of here.  She helps Parker to his feet.    at a payphone outside a minimall. Could be any one of the 10,000 in Los Angeles. It's late morning.   Give him a break, would you?   Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...  She gets into the driver's seat. Parker the passenger's. Madison punches the gas.    appear at the back of the stage. Guns raised. Distracting the musicians. As Parker and Madison charge through the horn section toward Sid 6.7, the musicians stop playing.   Hey, Parker...  She moves around, trying to get a clean shot at Sid 6.7. Which she does not have.    I couldn't tell you.   Duck!  Without hesitation, Parker hits the deck. Leaving Sid 6.7 completely exposed. Madison steadies her sight.   What do we do now?   What should we do with it?  Glancing in the flatbed of a truck, Parker gets an idea, and knocks on the driver's window. As the DRIVER rolls down his window, classic ROCK &amp; ROLL MUSIC can be heard from inside."

    "description": "The Law Enforcement Technology Advancement Centre (LETAC) has developed SID version 6.7: a Sadistic, Intelligent, and Dangerous virtual reality entity which is synthesized from the personalities of more than 150 serial killers. LETAC would like to train police officers by putting them in VR with SID, but they must prove the concept by using prisoners as test subjects. One such prisoner is ex-cop Parker Barnes. When SID manages to inject his personality into a nano-machine android, it appears that Barnes might be the only one who can stop him.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au>",
