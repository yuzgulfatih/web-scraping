        "Dan": "I just wanted to come here.   This Denny's.  It's kind of embarrassing but,  I had a dream about this place.  You see what I mean...  Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream. Herb stares at Dan to see if he will continue. Dan looks around nervously, then stares at his uneaten food.  That's it.  To get rid of this god-awful feeling.  Around here. Dan takes Herb across the front of Denny's to a narrow sidewalk that leads down the side toward the back. They begin walking down the narrow sidewalk - past a payphone. Dan begins to sweat the nearer he gets to the rear corner of the building. Red bricks glide by slowly.         They two guys in dark suits? Adam nods and walks over to the limo. The limo driver eyes him and his 7-iron suspiciously.",

        "Herb": "Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?   To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?  Okay. Why this Denny's?  Go ahead.  Oh boy.  Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.  So, you came to see if he's out there?   Right then.  Herb gets up, picks up the bill and goes to the cashier to pay. Dan just sits. As Herb is paying the bill he looks over at Dan just as Dan is turning to look at him. From Dan's point of view Herb is standing in exactly the same spot as he stood in the dream. Herb gets a strange feeling, turns back and finishes up with the cashier. He motions for Dan to follow him. Dan rises reluctantly and he and Herb make their way outside.  Dan! ... Dan! You all right? ... Dan! He kneels down and studies his friend. He feels for a pulse in the neck. He listens for breathing. His friend is dead.   My God!",
        "Detective": "You feel it?  Yeah. They continue to stare.  Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.  Two men... two guns in the Caddy.  The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy. Neal holds up a plastic bag holding a pearl earring.  Yeah, they showed me  Could be unrelated.  Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?  No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.  That's what I'm thinkin'. Detective Harry McKnight turns and crosses Mulholland. His eyes move over each blade of grass at the shoulder - each desert bush just beyond. He slowly raises his gaze to the shining lights of Hollywood laying far below like a galaxy. He looks out and wonders.   Nice wallets.  Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.  The one of 'em still alive?  Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.  Oh yeah.   Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.  Find out who they are?  Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.   Interesting.  Yeah ... and they both use the same address.  Where at?  Palmdale.  Damn, that's a long drive.",

        "Man": "What are you doing? You don't stop here ... The car stops - half on, half off the road at a dark, blind curve. Both men turn to the woman.  Hi there...ten bucks says you're Betty.   That's okay.  There was an accident. I came here.   A car ... a car accident.  I think so. I was just taking a shower.  My name is Rita.   Pardon?  Of course. Excuse me. The Espresso Man leaves the room. Luigi looks at the espresso. Vincenzo stares at Adam. Adam is doing his best to stare down Vincenzo. The Espresso man returns with a cloth napkin and lays it down next to the espresso.  Will that be all, Sir? Luigi doesn't answer and after a moment of standing very still waiting, the Espresso Man turns and leaves the room. Adam is stared down by Vincenzo and averts his eyes to the espresso cup. He looks around at Ray and Mr. Darby - seeing them stare at the espresso cup. Vincenzo keeps staring at Adam. Luigi picks up the napkin and holds it in his left hand. With his right hand he lifts the espresso cup and places it above the napkin. He brings the cup and napkin to his mouth. He takes a sip of espresso. A small fleeting expression forms on Luigi's impassive face as if for one millisecond he is going to vomit. His mouth opens and he allows the espresso to fall and dribble onto the napkin. He pushes any remaining espresso in his mouth out with his tongue. He holds it in that position for a moment.  Who is it please?  Hello.   Talk to me...  Same.   Hi ... this is me. Leave me a message. Betty now has her ear pressed up against the phone also - straining to hear everything. The machine starts recording. Betty hangs up the phone immediately.  I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.  The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.  I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.  Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.  That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.  Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher. The Hotel Manager turns to leave and Adam closes the door.  Yes?  Number 17.  I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right. The woman seems to be looking now at Rita.  It's kind of hidden by the foliage. Betty and Rita start to leave.  She hasn't been around for a few days ...    I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff. The phone rings from inside her bungalow.   Oh ... go ahead. I've got to get that. The woman hurries back inside and closes the door. Betty and Rita quickly move up the walkway toward Bungalow #17.",

        "Roque": "Then?  Yes?     Yes? He listens through a high-tech earplant which we now see.  Thank you. He pushes two buttons, one after another on the remote device. We hear a small click, a dial tone, a number being dialed, and a phone ringing.    She's still missing. We hear a small click and the line goes dead. Mr. Roque pushes a button and the microphone descends back into the chair.",
        "Irene": "Now, remember I'll be watching for you on the big screen.  The best of luck to you, Betty. Take care of yourself and be careful."

    "description": "Still untarnished by the false promises of the rapacious film industry, the wide-eyed actress, Betty, sets foot on bustling, sun-kissed Hollywood. Brimming with hope, and eager to spread her wings and prove her worth, Betty moves in Aunt Ruth's expensive apartment, unbeknownst to her, however, that fate has other plans in store for her, setting the stage for life-altering experiences with the unexpected, the indecipherable, and the unknown. Now, in the centre of an elaborate labyrinth of half-truths, faded memories, unrequited loves, and dangerous encounters with the city's ugly face lies a strange key to a mysterious keyhole, an even stranger indigo-blue cube, the young director, Adam, and one cryptic woman: the amnesiac brunette and devilishly seductive car-crash survivor, Rita. But, time flies and Rita's opaque past demands answers. After all, both women deserve the truth. What is the secret of the serpentine, dream-crushing Mulholland Drive?—Nick Riganas",
