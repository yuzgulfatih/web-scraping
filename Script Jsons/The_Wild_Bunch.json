Mapache is having difficulty understanding. He looks at Z'amorra with a puzzled expression.  He went a little crazy when he saw her with you. Mapache laughs. His ego is pleased with the idea that.he had taken someone's woman. He turns and explains grandly in Spanish to the rest of. the cantina.  Thought we might sell a few horses.

Aurora swings and catches him full handed across the face9 the groceries scatter on the floor -- Pike bounces off the wall,. looks at her, tries to grin.  Your husband due back?  No! He picks up a pan with a hot handle, drops it, spilling hot stew or soup on his foot, hops around cursing looking at the shambles on the stove and on the floor.' 236DD AURORA STANDS LOOKING AT HIM WITH LOVE, then smiling softly crosses to the side-board and pours him a drink. He takes it, suddenly both are laughing.  Suddenly Pike embraces her and pulls her to the bed. They begin to make love, then: THE DOOR SMASHES OUN AND LUKE, a skinny bad mouthed Texan steps into the room, a_double barreled shot gun in his hands ready to fire. AURORA SCREAMS and throws herself in front of Pike. Luke fires, the charge killing her as Pike dives out of bed -- jumping for his gun on a nearby table. LUKE FIRES AGAIN, the blast catching Pike across the thigh and knee. Pike goes down. Luke crosses to the bed and sits watching him writhing almost bleeding to death on the floor.      She had a husband and I should have had enough sense to kill him. He wasn't around and I got careless. One night he.walked in on us - - got her with the first shot. He caught me here with the second then the damndd coward turned and ran.  Not yet but there-hasn't been.a day or an hour that I haven't thought about getting him - - he didn't want that woman he just. wanted to kill somebody - - well, he killed  This is the last go round - - this time we do it right.  266 THE ENGINE AND.

He whistles loudly and calls out :   Ride ahead a hundred yards and check the washes...  You and I will cover the flanks --  Keep on the gun -- watch the rim.    Where? Angel smiles, then turns and calls softly.  (his gun out, still hidden in the shadows Cut him loose 388 ANGEL SPEAKS, LED BY IGNACIO, THEY QUICKLY FREE TECTOR and hand him his weapons with murmured apologies. Tector looks at them, whistles, softly.   Don't break that fuse... Angel lifts a crate.  They part of your village?  How long have they been around?  How long have they been following us... close? 391 ANGEL EASES THE RIFLE CRATE DOWN, TWO PEONS TAKE IT. He turns to Ignacio.  If they ever get armed and led, this whole country'll go up in smoke.

Quicker I get back, the quicker the next load'll get here. 399 HERRERA BRINGS A SMALL WOODEN STRONG BOX. Kneeling on the ground he opens it and counts out two small bags of gold, and hands them to Zamorra. Zamorra hands them to Pike.  About two.. miles up the arroyo ... three cases of rifles, one of ammunition, are in the brush behind it.  Our contract was 16 cases of rifles and 8 of ammunition -- for $10,000 -- not a machine gun.   I'll think it over.    Just carryin' all this weight. He hold's up two bags of gold.

Finally:  We take one sack to pay our way.  I hate to see an animal treated like that.  Maybe we- could buy him. They are silent for a long moment. Finally:  We,could use another gun. 450 MAPACHE, ZAMORRA AND THE GERMAN ADVISORS NOW GROUPED around the fire see the men.  I want to buy him back... Dutch and the others look at him surprised,     I'll give half my share to get him back.  You've had your fun with him...  Want to go hunting, General? Mapache looks at him confused.  Why not?.
