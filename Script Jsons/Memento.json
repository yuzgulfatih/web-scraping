        "Teddy": "That thing's been here for years.  Leonard gets out of the Jaguar and moves to the pickup. He inspects it with a methodical, practiced eye. Teddy follows.    Leonard flips the photo over. On the white strip on the back, in the same small handwriting.         MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 3.   Find anything? Didn't think so, let's go, yeah?  Leonard neither replies nor turns around. Teddy, worried, affects a casual air, shrugging dismissively,   Fuck this.  Teddy turns and heads for the door. Leonard LEAPS on him, pistol-whipping him furiously as he shouts:   You don't have a clue, you freak.  Leonard crouches down and grabs Teddy by the lapels.   Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.   You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.   MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99  4.    That's who you were, you don't know who you are.   Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.  Teddy gestures towards the basement door, in pain, but enjoying Leonard's growing anxiety.    C'mon, Lenny - we'll take a look down there together. Then you'll know. You'll know what you really are.  Leonard glances fearfully at the door, then looks at Teddy. He THRUSTS the barrel of his gun into Teddy's mouth and WE ARE AT THE SHOT FROM THE END OF THE OPENING SEQUENCE. Teddy panics, shaking his head, trying to talk around the metal, but GAGS just as Leonard pulls the trigger. A SHOT rings out as we -    Lenny!  Leonard nods in apparent recognition, wary.   Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.    *   Only every time I see ya!    MEMENTO Pink Revision - 9/7/99 6.  7    EXT. DISCOUNT INN CAR PARK - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;    7 </colour> Teddy starts for a GREY SEDAN. Leonard pauses behind him.   This is your car.   Just trying to have a little fun.  8    INT. CAR - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;  8 </colour> Leonard drives, Teddy admires the new car' s interior, reaching down around the seats, exploring the car with his hands.   Roll your window up, will ya?  Leonard hits his window button. A few fragments of safety glass rise out of the door, remnants of a broken window.   I can get that fixed for you.  Leonard shrugs.   So where are we going, Sherlock?      MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99   What the hell you want to go there for?   Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.    * Why are we going there?   Yup?   Lenny, is that you?   Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.   Lenny! I thought you'd gone for good. What brings you back?  Leonard looks at Teddy, sizing him up.   You said you were leaving town.   So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.    Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.  44   INT. DINER - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;44 </colour> Teddy pours ketchup all over his steak. Leonard plays with his food.   Not hungry?         29.   You don't have to remember to be hungry.   Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?   The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?  Leonard shrugs. Teddy licks his fingers and frowns.   Leonard, you need to be very careful.   Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.   Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.   Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.   You really want to find this guy?   You're living.   We'll find him. Where are you staying?  Leonard reaches into his pocket and takes out a Polaroid.   Probably left it in your room.   MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 31.  45   EXT. DISCOUNT INN - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;   45 </colour> The Jaguar pulls up. Leonard gets out and heads to the office.  46   INT. DISCOUNT INN OFFICE - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt; 46 </colour> Leonard enters. Burt is behind the counter reading a magazine.   Lenny! I thought you'd gone for good. What brings you back?   Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?    45.   I get it - amorous neighbors.    You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.  Leonard thinks, then moves to the CLOSET and OPENS the door. Teddy looks in DISBELIEF at the Man in the closet.   Who the fuck is that?   No! Should I?  Leonard shrugs.   Is this John G.?   Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?   Ask him.  Leonard crouches down and RIPS the tape from the Man's mouth.   I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -   Natalie? Natalie who?   I think I know her.  Leonard sticks his pictures in his pocket.   He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.   How'd ya get him in here in the first place?   Wait, we can't just leave him. The maid* finds him, calls the cops. He's seen us now *  Leonard thinks.    *   Why would I have a gun?  Leonard fishes the HANDGUN out of the bedside table drawer.    MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99  Fucking hope not.  Leonard covers Dodd with the gun while Teddy pulls him out of the closet. Dodd has trouble standing up straight.   MEMENTO Pink Revisions -  9/7/99 48.  70   EXT. DODD'S MOTEL - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;   70 </colour> Teddy exits the room, glances around, motions for Leonard and Dodd to follow. Dodd is cleaned up and unbound, Leonard is pressed up right behind him. The three of them descend to the parking lot.   We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.   Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.   Give me your keys.  Leonard looks at him, suspicious.   So was he scared?   Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.   You like it? Let's trade.  73   EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THE MOTEL - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;   73 </colour> The grey sedan pulls up beside Leonard's Jaguar. Leonard gets out.   So what are you gonna do now?   Natalie who?  Leonard ignores him and gets into his Jaguar.    Leonard picks the stack of Polaroids out of his outside jacket pocket. He flips through them until he finds the one of Teddy, then picks up the phone and dials Teddy's number. The phone is answered:       MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 52.   You know what to do.  Then a BEEP. Leonard does not look like he knows what to do.   You should lock a car as nice as this.  Teddy is in the passenger seat. Leonard, startled, GRABS him by the throat.    Teddy. Your buddy.    Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.  Leonard lets him go.   Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?   Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.   Whose house do you think you just walked out of?  Leonard looks at the house. Teddy motions towards Leonard's pockets.   Take a look at your pictures, I bet you got one of her.  Leonard pulls out his Polaroids and flips through them. He pauses at the one of Natalie. Teddy SWIPES it out of his hands to get a better look at the blurred image of Natalie turning in a doorway.   Great shot, Lenny.  Teddy flips the photo over. There is nothing on the back. Teddy hands it back to Leonard.   You wanna make a note that you can't trust her.   Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake.    67.  You can't stay with her. Let me give you the name of a motel.  Teddy starts looking for a piece of paper.   Good thing I found you. She's bad news.   She's involved with these drug dealers.  Teddy opens the GLOVE COMPARTMENT, finding a STACK OF BEER MATS from a local bar called FERDY'S.  *   See these? That's the bar where she works. Her boyfriend's a drug dealer. She'd take orders for him, arrange meets. He'd write messages on these, then leave it on the bar. She'd drop replies when she served him drinks.   She's gonna use you. To protect herself.   Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.   She couldn't.    She has no idea who I am.   I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.  Leonard takes out his pen, places the picture of Natalie face down on the dash and writes on the white strip on the back:   I won't be happy until you leave town.   How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?   The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.   Like how'd you get this car? That suit?   From what?   So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?  Leonard says nothing. Teddy laughs.   You haven't got a clue, have you? You don't even know who you are?   That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.  Teddy reaches out to Leonard's lapel, and gently opens his jacket to reveal the label.   Put it this way. Were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance?*  Leonard looks down at his suit, then back to Teddy.   I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.   Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town.   MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 70.   It's been fun, Lenny.  Teddy walks off. Leonard pulls his Polaroids out of his pocket and finds the one of Teddy. He places it on the dash, face up, next to the one of Natalie which is still face down on the dash. Leonard reads the message he has written on the back of Natalie's picture:    Outside, a CAR ALARM starts to sound. Leonard gets up and heads to the door, flipping through his Polaroids.  121  EXT. NATALIE'S HOUSE - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;121 </colour> The Jaguar's CAR ALARM is sounding.  Leonard exits Natalie's house, walks to his Jaguar and gets in, silencing the alarm.   You should lock a car as nice as this.  Leonard, startled, GRABS Teddy by the throat.   Hi, Lenny.  The tattooist turns and looks up at Teddy.  *   It's alright, we know each other, right, Lenny?  The tattooist looks to Leaonard. Leonard shrugs. *   The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.  Teddy cranes his neck to see what the tattoo says, but only \"6. LI\" is visible.   You should have just left town, Lenny. There's Tattoo parlors up North.   Gimme the keys, I'll move the car.  Leonard watches Teddy.      MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 98.   Lenny, I'll be back in a minute. I've got to get you some stuff.   Give us a minute, will ya?  She shrugs and heads into the back. Teddy watches her go, then turns to Leonard, conspiratorial.   We've got to get you out of here. *   Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.   Because that cop's looking for you. We * need to get you a change of identity. Some new clothes and a different car should do for now. Put these on.  *  Teddy offers the bag of clothes. Leonard refuses it.  *   This bad cop. He checked you into the  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you    * for days, sticking envelopes under your* door, telling you shit. *   He knows you're no good on the phone, so    * he calls you up to bullshit you.  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so* he slips something under your door to  * frighten you into answering your phone * again. He's been pretending to help you.    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.    * being some local drug dealer.*   'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.    I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.     MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 100.   He wanted to know all, about Jimmy Grantz.   Jimmy's a drug dealer. This cop wanted to know all about how he sets up deals, shit like that. He's got some score in mind * and you're involved. Come on, there's no    * time to argue - if he knew I was helping    * you he'd find a way to kill me. Just get    * these clothes on. You're gonna take my * car and get the fuck out of here. *  Leonard heads back into the curtained cubicle with the plastic bag of clothes.   MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 102.   Lenny!  Leonard smiles cautiously, and offers his hand.   Just Teddy. Don't write Gammell please.  Leonard raises his eyebrows.   I'm undercover. Here's directions. He'll be heading there now.     MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 104.   Wouldn't be appropriate.*  Leonard climbs into the truck. Teddy taps on the window.   Leonard?  Leonard cranks it down. Teddy looks at Leonard with something like fatherly affection.   Make him beg.   What's wrong?   No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?   So what were you doing here?  Teddy moves to the body and crouches down to examine it.   Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.  Leonard CRACKS Teddy over the head with the FLOORBOARD.    *   FUCK, Lenny! That fucking kills!   Yeah, and I helped you find the guy you* were looking for - *   I think you've got the wrong idea -  Leonard GRABS Teddy.   Sure he did. He raped your wife and    * fucked up your brain.   *   His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check   * your tattoos. *   What -   *   A load of amphetamine I told him I had.   That, and your thing.   *    MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10/4/99 111.   Jimmy's your guy, Leonard. I just figured   * we'd make some money on the side. *   The Discount Inn, he deals out of there.    * The guy at the front desk lets him know if anybody comes snooping around. He called Jimmy as soon as you took a picture of that dump.   *   No!  You get half. *  Leonard THROWS him against the wall.    You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. \"Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis\". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?    I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -   Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. \"learning through repetition\" -       Sammy was a con man. A faker.       You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.    MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99 113.   Sammy didn't have a wife.  Leonard freezes, staring at Teddy.   It was your wife who had diabetes.  Leonard thinks.  175  INT.

I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'   * Jimmy down there.   He was to you. Come on, Lenny, you got * your revenge - just enjoy it while you * still remember.    *   MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99 115.    What difference does it make whether he* was your guy or not?    *   Why? You're never going to know.  *   No, you won't.   You won't remember!   I thought so too! I was sure you'd* remember. But you didn't.    *     You know, when we found your guy and   * killed him.  That's right, the real John G. Over a  * year ago. I helped you find him. He's  * already dead. *   I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your* wife's death. I believed you, I thought* you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife.    * We found him and you killed him.  *   MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99  You didn't remember, so I helped you   * start looking again, looking for the guy    * you already killed.   Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.  Leonard looks at the Polaroid of himself.   That's the picture, right? I took that, right when you did it. Look how happy you   * are. Before you forgot. I wanted to see* that face again.   Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and   * you were more than happy to help. You lie   * to yourself! You don't want the truth, * the truth is a fucking coward. So you  * make up your own truth. *     MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99 116.   Look at your police file. It was complete   * when I gave it to you. Who took the 12 * pages out?    *   No. You took them out.  *   To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.    My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.* I'm the one that has to live with what * you've done. I'm the one that has to put    * it all together. You just wander around* playing detective. You're living a dream,   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't* in the picture.    *  Leonard sticks the gun in Teddy's face.*   Quit it! *        * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why * you're so good at it.   *  Leonard SEARCHES Teddy's pockets, still holding the gun on * Teddy. Leonard finds Teddy's CAR KEYS. He gets off Teddy and    * moves towards the light.*     MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99  Hey, where are you going? You know what* time it is?   *  Leonard stares at Teddy, mystified.

Leonard UNLOCKS the trunk, TURNING to Teddy as he does so.   You just killed the guy who owned it! Somebody'll recognize it!  Leonard pulls Teddy's EMPTY gun out of his pocket.",
        "Sammy": "He stares at the message for a second, thoughtful, then tries to scrub the writing off his skin. To his surprise, it is INDELIBLE.

That if I could just say the right thing he'd snap out of it and be back to normal?

I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.  Leonard plays with his letter opener, thinking.

        "Burt": "That guy's here already.  Burt TAPS the POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH of Teddy which is sitting on the counter. Leonard picks up the photo and turns to see Teddy APPROACHING the glass door of the office. Leonard watches carefully as Teddy shambles up to the office door. A BELL CHIIIES as Teddy enters and breaks into his shit-eating grin. Leonard slips the photo into his pocket.   Hiya.   What can I do for you, Leonard?   Burt.   You don't know?    You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?   Condition?   Amnesia?    I don't mean to mess with you. It's just so weird.

Not if you remember to pay your bill.  Leonard smiles and reaches into his wallet.  E.C.U. of fingers rifling bills in a wallet. Leonard counts out some money and hands it to Burt. Burt takes the money, spotting something over Leonard's shoulder.   That guy's here already.  Burt TAPS the POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH of Teddy which is sitting on the counter.

There is an address written beneath it .    *    He sticks the note in his pocket and pulls out his Polaroid photographs. He flips through them until he finds Natalie's. Leonard flips the picture over. On the back are two handwritten messages. The first one has been completely scribbled over, the second reads:   You don't remember me.   You did explain, Lenny.  Leonard shifts uncomfortably.   You told me.  Leonard raises his eyebrows, then smiles.     MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99  18.   Yeah.   Is that what your little note says?   Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.  Natalie smiles.   But I guess that's why you got those freaky tattoos.  Leonard is surprised.   I'm sorry.  She takes a BROWN ENVELOPE out of her handbag.   I do have information for you. You gave me a license plate number? I had my friend at the DMV trace it. Guess what name came up.  Leonard shrugs.      MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99  John Edward Gamme11. John G.     MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 19.   No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before  Natalie slides the envelope towards him, but stops short.   This is a copy of his registration, license, photo and all. Are you sure you want this?   Yes.   But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.   Tell me about her again.   Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.   Don't just recite the words. Close your eyes, remember her.  Leonard smiles and shuts his eyes.   I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.   It's isolated.   I wasn't helping you for money.   It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...  Leonard smiles. Natalie reaches into her purse and pulls out a MOTEL ROOM KEY.   Are you still at the Discount Inn? Room* 304? You left this at my place.  Leonard pulls out a Polaroid of the Discount Inn.*   They treating you alright?   You know what we have in common?  Leonard shrugs.   We're both survivors. Take care, Leonard.  Leonard watches Natalie leave. He sits at the table, looking down at the BROWN ENVELOPE and the MOTEL ROOM KEY . Leonard rises, and heads to the restroom.  27   INT. RESTAURANT RESTROOM - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt; 27 </colour> Leonard flushes the urinal, then moves to the sink and starts washing his hands. He notices a MESSAGE written on the back of his hand:    FURNISHED - MORNING &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt; </colour> Leonard opens his eyes, naked in bed. He looks around, confused. With a START, he realizes that someone else is in the bed: a BRUNETTE with her back to him.  Leonard leans right over her to get a look at her face. It is NATALIE. The BRUISE on her eye and the MARK on her lip are worse than before.  She OPENS her eyes and is startled by the sight of Leonard's hovering face.   Sleep okay?   I gotta be someplace.  She gets out of bed, wearing pajamas. Leonard swings his legs out of the bed and realizes that he is wearing trousers and socks. He looks at his tattoos, as if he has never seen them before.   Pretty weird.  She is smiling at him in the mirror. Leonard smiles, shrugs.           * I should be able to talk to my friend  * about the license plate today.    *         * John G's license plate number. You have* it tattooed on your thigh.   *  Natalie leaves the room. Leonard pulls down his trousers to* reveal two tattoos:*   If it's registered in this state it'll * just take seconds to pull up his license and registration. I'll call when I've spoken to him.        MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99  34.    I'm helping you because you helped me.  Leonard nods.   So will you remember me next time you seo me?  Leonard shakes his head and reaches for the note. Natalie grabs his lapel and pulls him down to her, kissing him gently on the mouth.   I think you will.    Lenny, before you go, can I have my shirt back please?  She tosses him his blue shirt. Leonard looks down at the white shirt which he has put on. It is way too small.  51   EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;    51 </colour> The Jaguar pulls up to a red light. Suddenly Teddy is banging on the window.    Natalie takes the picture and examines it.   Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.   Come inside.   &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt; </colour> Natalie shows Leonard in.   MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 37.   Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.   Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.  She gestures at the BRUISING on her face.   I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.   Yes.   Did you?   Kill him.   This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.  She tries to rip the picture. Leonard watches her try. The plastic is too strong.   You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.   Such as?   Your wife?   Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.  Leonard takes his jacket off and places it on the back of the couch, patting the pockets as he does so.   Just relax.  She reaches for his arm and unbuttons his cuff, revealing the end of Leonard's tattoos.   You don't seem the type.  She pushes back the sleeve, trying to read the tattoo. Leonard watches her.    *   Come on.  She starts to unbutton his shirt. He watches. Natalie gasps as she opens Leonard's shirt and pulls it back over his shoulders. She tilts her head, trying to read the different messages.   It's backwards.    *  She pulls him up and turns him around in front of the mirror    * to read the backwards tattoo across his chest.   *   Here?    *  Leonard looks down at the blank patch, then at Natalie,    * vulnerable, confused.   *   I've lost somebody.   His name was Jimmy.   He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.   A guy called Teddy.  Leonard does not react to the name.   They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.  Natalie puts the photo down. She reaches out to Leonard,   * spreading her fingers over the blank part of his chest.    *   When you find this guy, this John G., what are you going to do?   Maybe I can help you find him. I know a* lot of people.  58   INT. NATALIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt; 58 </colour> Natalie, eyes closed, has her head on Leonard's chest. He is      MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 41.    Teddy looks at the photo over Leonard's shoulder.   &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt; </colour> The Jaguar pulls up. Leonard checks the address against the address written on his Polaroid of Natalie, then goes to the door and RINGS the bell. It is opened by Natalie.    Leonard dresses, puts the Polaroid into the inside pocket of his jacket. He looks again at the note. It says:    Leonard picks the stack of Polaroids out of his outside jacket pocket. He flips through them until he finds the one of Teddy, then picks up the phone and dials Teddy's number. The phone is answered:       MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 52.   What does it look like?!  She turns to Leonard so that he can see the full extent of her injuries. Her eye is SWELLING UP, and her lip is SPLIT.   He beat the shit out of me.   Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.  Natalie FLINGS her purse to the ground in frustration. She does not know what to do with her hands.   Because of you, you fucking idiot! Because I did what you told me!   MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 74.   Go to him, reason with him, tell him about Teddy! Great fucking ideal  Leonard APPROACHES her, palms out.   I did exactly what you told me. I went to   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.   He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.   What are you gonna do?   And?   MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 75.   He'll kill you, Lenny.   Yeah?   This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.  Leonard takes out a piece of paper but he cannot find his pen.    He'll probably find you.   I told him about your car.   He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!  Leonard hands Natalie the piece of paper and pen.    Outside, a CAR ALARM starts to sound. Leonard gets up and heads to the door, flipping through his Polaroids.  121  EXT. NATALIE'S HOUSE - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;121 </colour> The Jaguar's CAR ALARM is sounding.  Leonard exits Natalie's house, walks to his Jaguar and gets in, silencing the alarm.   Somebody's come. Already.   Calls himself Dodd.   Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.   No!   You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?   I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!   What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -  Leonard is getting frustrated.   Don't protect him.   Help me.   Get rid of Dodd for me.   Kill him. I'll pay you.   What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?   Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!   I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!  Leonard stands up.   That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!   Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!  Leonard steps towards her.   You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.   I'm gonna use you, you stupid fuck. I'm telling you now because I'll enjoy it more if I know that you could stop me if you weren't a freak.      80.   Lost your pen? That's too bad, freak. Otherwise you could've written yourself a little note about how much Natalie hates your retarded guts.  Leonard moves around the room searching for a pen. Natalie follows him, speaking into his ear.   No pens here, I'm afraid. You're never going to know that I called you a retard, and your wife a whore.  Leonard turns to face her, barely controlling his anger.   About your whore of a wife?  Leonard slaps Natalie. She smiles, then speaks softly.   I read about your problem. You know what one of the causes of short term memory loss is?  Leonard fumes.   Venereal disease. Maybe your cunt of a wife sucked one too many diseased cocks and turned you into a retard.  Leonard turns away, body tensed, ready to snap. Natalie reaches out to gently brush the hair above his ear with her fingers.   You sad freak, you won't remember any of what I've said, and we'll be best friends, or even lovers.  Leonard spins around, BACKHANDING Natalie on the cheek.  He PUNCHES her in the mouth then pushes her to the floor. He stands over her, furious with himself as much as her.     81.   See you soon.  Natalie exits. Leonard watches her walk out to her car and get in. She just sits there.  Leonard turns from the window and looks around the room. He grabs at drawers, searching for a pen. He looks back out the    * window. Natalie is still sitting in her car. Leonard is    * sifting through the papers on the desk when he hears a car * door SLAM. He looks out of the window to see Natalie getting    * out of her car. She turns to walk toward the house. Her face is swollen and bloody.  Leonard opens the door for her.   What does it look like?  124  INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - DAY &lt;<black and=\"\" sequence=\"\" white=\"\">&gt;   124 </black> Leonard lies on the bed, in jeans, topless. He reaches for the ringing phone with his left arm. As his hand reaches the receiver Leonard reads the tattoo on his arm which says:   *   You can just crash out on the couch. You'll be comfortable.  Leonard nods and stands awkwardly.   Uh, take a seat.  Leonard smiles and sits down in a chair. Natalie clears things off the coffee table. Leonard unzips his bag and looks   * through his things, pulling out his file.   *   So how long you think it's gonna take you?  Leonard raises his eyebrows.   You told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife.   Can I ask you something?  Leonard nods.   If you've got all this information, how come the police haven't found him for you?   Why not?     MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 83.   How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?   You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.   I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.  Leonard nods. Natalie heads for the door.   Somebody's come. Already.   On the house.    You really do have a problem. Just like that cop said.  Leonard looks at Natalie, confused.     MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99  Your condition, I mean.     MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 87.   What's the last thing you remember? Leonard looks at her.   Sweet.   What?   Let me get you a fresh glass. I think this one was dusty.    What do you want?   Don't just waltz in here dressed like  * that and order a beer.  *  Leonard looks over to the filthy Drunk, then back at Natalie.   What are you here for?   Well, that's me.   You tell me.   You're the memory guy?   My boyfriend told me about you.        Jimmy Grantz. Know him?  Leonard shrugs.   Well, it seems like Jimmy knows you. He told me about you. Said you were staying over at the Discount. Then, just this  * evening, this cop comes in here looking* for you. Looking for a guy who couldn't remember stuff, who'd forget how he got here or where he was going. I told him we get a lot of guys like that in here.  Leonard does not find this funny.   Are you Teddy?   Did Teddy send you?   What's happened to Jimmy?     MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 91.   You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?  Leonard shakes his head.   So why did you come here?  Leonard pulls the beer mat out of his pocket and hands it to Natalie.     Your pocket.  She retreats down the bar to attend to a CUSTOMER, eyeing Leonard suspiciously as he pulls out his Polaroids.   Bar bet.  Leonard shakes his head and looks down. He hears a snort and glances over again. The Drunk is pushing his finger against one nostril, whilst blowing snot out the other into the tankard. Natalie smiles again.   For a lot of money.    MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 92.   Care to contribute?  Leonard shakes his head, disgusted. Natalie waves the tankard in his face.   Come on, proceeds are going to charity.  Leonard drops a tidy blob of spit into the beer, shakes his head, revolted. Natalie places the mug on the bar in front of the stool next to Leonard's. She takes a long-handled spoon and stirs it vigorously. Leonard grabs his Polaroids and moves over to a booth.  Natalie brings over the tankard arid places it in front of him, smiling.   On the house.    Leonard looks up at the doorway of the bar, then pulls the * car around into the parking lot. Natalie is standing by a  * dumpster, heaving a trash bag into it. She watches the car * pull up, unable to see the driver. Natalie casually knocks on   * the passenger side window. Leonard lowers the window and   * Natalie leans down.*         * Hey, Jimmy -  *  Natalie stares at Leonard confused.    *   I'm sorry, I... I thought you were* someone else. *  Natalie backs away from the car, perturbed. Just before she* disappears around the corner, she tips the lid of the * dumpster, letting it fall with a metallic howl and a BANG. *    Leonard sticks it back in his pocket. He PEEKS through the curtains. Teddy is sitting by the door, waiting. Leonard looks around, NOTICES a window set high in the wall above the padded bench in the cubicle. Leonard CLIMBS on the bench, OPENS the window and SQUEEZES himself through.  152  EXT.

Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?  Leonard comes out of the gloom, stopping in front of Jimmy, studying his face. Leonard has a JACK HANDLE in his hand.

        "Leonard": "So where are you?  Leonard lifts his head. He is lying on a queen-sized bed.   You're in some motel room.   Looks like somebody's home.  Teddy looks from Leonard to the pickup and back.   I think you're wrong. These tracks aren't* more than a few days old.  Leonard opens the door of the pickup and searches the interior.

He pulls a stack of POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS out of his pocket and leafs through them as Teddy starts walking towards him.  Leonard finds a photo showing Teddy with a shit-eating grin standing in front of the pickup truck. On the broad white strip beneath the photo is handwritten:   I've finally found him. How long have I* been looking?*  Leonard stuffs the Polaroids back into his pocket, reaches around to the back of his waistband and draws a HANDGUN, keeping it out of Teddy's line of sight. Teddy enters, wary.    Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!    Teddy!    MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99  I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -   Shut your mouth!   So you're in some motel room...  He gets up, surveys the room as if for the first time. He wears BOXERS and a PLAID WORK SHIRT.   ... you don't know how long you've been there, or how you got there...  There is a room key on the dresser. The plastic tag identifies it as the key to ROOM 21. Leonard opens drawers in the room.      5.   Just some anonymous motel room. Won't tell you anything. Nothing in the drawers, but you look anyway.  He reaches for the bedside table drawer.   Nothing except the Gideon Bible.  He opens the drawer to find a Gideon Bible.   It's Leonard... like I told you before.  Teddy pretends to think hard.    I guess I've told you about my condition.  Teddy grins and holds the door open for Leonard.   My car.  Teddy glances back in surprise.    You're in a playful mood.  Leonard holds up a Polaroid of a late model JAGUAR.   Shouldn't make fun of somebody's  * handicap.  Teddy smiles and heads for the BRAND-NEW JAGUAR parked several cars further down.   It's broken.  Teddy looks, curious.   I got a lead on a place.  Leonard checks the note, then hands it to Teddy.

He  * tried writing himself notes. Lots of   * notes. But he'd get confused.  Leonard licks his thumb, and rubs at the writing. To Leonard's surprise, IT DOES NOT EVEN SMUDGE.  He notices his bare legs. There is a NOTE taped to his RIGHT THIGH with a handwritten message:   MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 8.   I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.   I'm sorry... um... ?   Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99  9.   I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.   That's the thing. I have this condition.   I have no memory.   No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...  He notices that Burt is staring at him as if he were an exotic insect.   I've told you this before, haven't I?   My wife.   Like waking. Like you always just woke up. *    How long have I been here?   So you're holding my calls?   Okay, but this guy's an exception.  Leonard places the Polaroid of Teddy on the counter in front of Burt. Burt looks at it.   Know this guy?   What makes you think he's my friend?   He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?   11.   Just this guy.  Leonard indicates the Polaroid of Teddy.   I hope my condition won't be a problem for you.    Leonard looks at his Polaroid photograph of the outside of the Discount Inn motel. There is an address written beneath it .    *   Thanks. Lincoln Street?  The Waiter glances at his Polaroid.   This guy told me his name was Teddy.  He turns the photo over and examines the white stop on the back. It says only:   Mr Gammell?   John Gammell?   I'll be waiting.   *  Leonard hangs up, thinking. He looks at the writing on the back of his hand, then pulls back his sleeve to reveal the words:    White... male. First name... John. Last name... G for Gammell. Drugs. License  * plate.

I    * remember everything from before my injury, I just can't make any new memories.   Leonard pulls his shirt off. There is a BANDAGE on his LEFT ARM.

Sammy's story helps me understand my own situation.  Leonard touches the tattoo on the back of his hand.   Sammy Jankis wrote himself endless notes. But he'd get mixed up. I've got a more graceful solution to the memory problem. I'm disciplined and organized. I use habit and routine to make my life possible. Sammy had no drive. No reason to make it work.  Leonard can see his reflection in the mirror. He studies the tattoo across his chest:   Me? I gotta reason.         MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 17.  23   EXT.

You see, I have this condition -   Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.   Then I probably told you how much I hated it.

It was useful experience, because now it's my life. When I meet someone, I don't even know if I've met them before. I have to look in their eyes and just figure them out. My job taught me that the best way to find out what someone knew was to let them talk.    Montage: Leonard, wearing a CHEAP DARK SUIT and TIE, sitting opposite various DIFFERENT PEOPLE in an interview situation.   Throw in the occasional \"why?\" but just listen. And watch the eyes, the body    * language.  Leonard watches the people's movements carefully. We see close-ups off fiddling hands, neck scratching, etc.  LEONARD  (cont'd) It's complicated. You might catch a sign but attach the wrong meaning to it. If someone touches their nose while they're talking, experts will tell you it means they're lying. It really means they're nervous, and people get nervous for all sorts of reasons. It's all about context.       MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 23.   I was good.

He makes eye contact with Natalie, but walks past her table. She sighs and grabs the back of his jacket.   I'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy. Mr Samuel R. Jankis - strangest case ever. Guy's 58, semi- retired accountant. He and his wife had been in this car accident... nothing too serious, but he's acting funny - he can't get a handle on what's going on.   The doctors find some possible damaqe to the hippocampus, nothing conclusive. But Sammy can't remember anything for more than a couple minutes. He can't work, can't do shit, medical bills pile up, his wife calls the insurance company and I get sent in.   My first big claims investigation - I really check into it. Sammy can think just fine, but he can't make any new memories, he can only remember things for a few minutes.  Sammy watches a commercial on T.V.          MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 27.   He'd watch T.V., but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing, he couldn't remember how it began. He liked commercials. They were short.     *  Sammy rolls a small GLASS BOTTLE between the palms of his hands. Mrs. Jankis rolls up her sleeve. Leonard watches as Sammy takes a SYRINGE and pushes the needle through the rubber of the bottle. The label is marked \"INSULIN\".  LEONARD (cont'd) The crazy part was that this guy who couldn't follow the plot of \"Green Acres\" could do the most complicated things as long as he had learned them before the accident...  Sammy INVERTS the bottle and syringe, DRAWS the insulin into the syringe, withdraws the needle, holds it up to check for bubbles, TAPPING it delicately.   ... and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing.  Sammy wipes a spot on Mrs. Jankis' arm with a swab, then gently PINCHES the skin and confidently INSERTS the needle.* Mrs Jankis winces. *   The doctors assure me that there's a real condition called Korsokoff's syndrome; short-term memory loss, rare but legit. But every time I see him I catch a look of recognition. Just a slight look, but he says he can't remember me at all.

MAIN STREET - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;    43 </colour> Leonard's Jaguar pulls up at a red light. Suddenly Teddy is BANGING on the window.   Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?   Things change.   Guess I've told you about my condition.    It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.   It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?   Who?   Why?   Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?   Why?     30.   Memory's unreliable.  Teddy snorts.   No, really. Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good. Ask the police, eyewitness testimony is unreliable. The cops don't catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff. They collect facts, make notes, draw conclusions. Facts, not memories: that's how you investigate. I know, it's what I used to do. Memory can change the shape of a room or the color of a car. It's an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted and they're irrelevant if you have the facts.   He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.   Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.  Teddy considers this.   Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.   I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.   So Sammy can't learn any new skills. But I find something in my research: Conditioning. Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition. It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike, things you don't think about, you just get better through practice. Call it muscle memory, whatever, but it's a completely different part of the brain from the short-term memory. So I have the doctors test Sammy's response to conditioning...   Some of the objects were electrified, They'd give him a small shock.     They kept repeating the test, always with the same objects electrified. The point was to see if he could learn to avoid the electrified objects. Not by memory, but by instinct.   Sorry. It's only me.  Leonard FLOPS down. Natalie wakes up fully and relaxes.   Yeah. You?  Natalie shrugs. She looks at her bedside clock.  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99  33.   Useful. You never write a phone number on your hand?   Yeah, the license plate...   *   Why don't we just arrange a meeting now?    * I'm not too good on the phone.  Natalie takes her eye pencil and writes a NOTE on a SMALL BAG   * FROM A PHARMACY. Leonard puts his jacket on. Natalie offers* him the note. It says:    It's great that you would... that you're helping me like this...    I'm sorry.  Leonard heads for the door.   They kept testing Sammy for months, always with the same objects carrying the electrical charge...   Even with total short-term memory loss, Sammy should've learned to instinctively stop picking up the wrong objects. All previous cases of short-term memory loss had responded to conditioning in some way. Sammy didn't respond at all.     It was enough to suggest his condition was psychological not physical.     36.   We turned down his claim on the grounds that he wasn't covered for mental illness. Sammy's wife got stuck with the bills and I got a promotion for rejecting a big claim.  Leonard looks into the mirror.   Conditioning didn't work for Sammy, so he became helpless. But it works for me. I live the way Sammy couldn't. Habit and Conditioning. Acting on instinct.  56   EXT./INT. NATALIE'S FRONT DOOR - DUSK &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;    56 * </colour> Leonard pulls up in his Jaguar, gets out, rings the front doorbell. It is opened by Natalie.   Natalie, right?  Natalie nods, wary of Leonard's barely concealed anger. Leonard thrusts a Polaroid photo in her face.   Who the fuck is Dodd?  The photo is of a MAN who is BOUND, GAGGED, and BLOODY. On the back of the photo:    Who is he? What have you got me into?  Natalie looks up and down the street.   That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!   How do I know he did that to you?   So I just take your word?    Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.   What?   Course not.  Natalie waves the Polaroid at him.       38.   You have to burn them.  Natalie scrunches it up and throws it down. Leonard and Natalie sit down on the couch.   There are things you know for sure.   I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.   She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.  Natalie stares at Leonard, thinking.       39.   It's not easy to be calm when -   It's... it must be for when I've found him. *     * She looks at Leonard. Leonard shrugs. Natalie studies * Leonard's chest, avoiding his eyes.    *   MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99   I'm sorry.     MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99  40.   What happened?   Who did he go to meet?  Natalie studies Leonard.   What do the police think?   Kill him.   I don't even know how long she's been  * gone. It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here because she's gone to the bathroom or something. But somehow I just   * know that she'll never come back to bed.    * I lie here, not knowing how long I've been alone.

I know I can't have her back, but I want    * to be able to let her go. I don't want to wake up every morning thinking she's still here then realizing that she's not. I want time to pass, but it won't. How * can I heal if I can't feel time?  Leonard bends his head around to see if Natalie is awake. She closes her eyes. Leonard gingerly slides from underneath her and moves silently out of the bedroom.  59   INT. NATALIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;  59 </colour> Leonard enters the dark room. He goes to the couch and picks up his shirt and his jacket. He notices the photograph which Natalie showed him on top of some papers on a desk in the corner. He holds it in a shaft of light from the streetlamp outside, studying the photo of Natalie and Jimmy.  60   INT.

NATALIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt; 61  Leonard has his Polaroid photograph of Natalie out. He takes a pen out of his jacket, rests the photo against the wall in a patch of light and writes on the back, underneath the message which has been scribbled out:   Sammy's wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him and fighting the company's decision - but it wasn't the money that got to her.   I never said that Sammy was faking. Just that his problem was mental, not physical. But she... she couldn't understand. She looks into his eyes and sees the same person. And if it's not a physical problem...  Sammy's Wife starts shouting at Sammy. Sammy squirms.   ... he should just... snap out of it.  Sammy's Wife THROWS her drink in Sammy's face, puts her head in her hands, SOBBING. Sammy wipes his face on his sleeve.     So good old Leonard Shelby from the insurance company gives her the seed of doubt, just like he gave it to the doctors. But I never said that Sammy was faking. I never said that.  Leonard takes a NEEDLE out of the packet.   - NIGHT &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;  Awake.  He rolls his eyes to one side.  LEONARD (cont'd) Where am I?  He lifts his head and surveys the room.  LEONARD (cont'd) Motel room.  He rises from the bed, looking at the room as if for the first time. He starts looking in the dresser drawers, finding nothing.  LEONARD (cont'd) Some anonymous motel room. Nothing in the drawers, but you look anyway.    MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 44.    A FISH-EYE TEDDY, grinning and waving.  69   INT.

Leonard reaches into his pocket and pulls out some Polaroids.   Just a minute!  He finds the one of Teddy, then sticks them back into his pocket. He OPENS the door to Teddy and grins.   Teddy!  Teddy brushes past him into the room.   Why are you here?   You don't know him?   I don't think so.   I might have fallen asleep before I did.  Teddy shakes his head, chuckling.   What's your name?    46.   Your name.   Who did this to you?   Who did this to you?   No. No, just let me think for a minute.  Leonard moves to the dresser and starts methodically emptying his pockets. He pulls a Polaroid out of his inside jacket pocket.   Here we go.  The Polaroid shows Dodd sitting on the bed, BOUND, GAGGED and BLEEDING. The name Dodd is written below the picture. Leonard flips it over. On the back it says:   Why?      47.   We've got to get him out of here.   We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.   I don't know.  Leonard looks around the room for inspiration.   Yes I do... this isn't my room.  Teddy looks around at the anonymous room.   It's his. He was already here. Let's just   * go. *  Leonard starts for the door, Teddy lays a hand on his chest.    *   Okay. We clean him up, untie him and   * march him out with a gun in his back.  *   It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.   Which one?  Dodd leads them to a new LANDCRUISER. Teddy whispers in Leonard's ear.   Shut it, Teddy.   I'll ride with him. You follow.   Take your own car.  Teddy shrugs. Leonard motions Dodd into the driver's seat, then slides into the passenger side. They pull out of the parking lot, Teddy following in his GREY SEDAN.  71   EXT.

I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.   Natalie, right?  Natalie nods, wary of Leonard's tone. Leonard THRUSTS a Polaroid in her face.   Who the fuck is Dodd?  The photo shows Dodd, BOUND, GAGGED and BLEEDING.   What Mrs. Jankis didn't understand was that you can't bully someone into remembering... the more pressure you're under, the harder it gets.  Then call me back.  Leonard hangs up.  76   INT. DODD'S MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;    76 </colour> Leonard sits on the toilet, grasping an empty VODKA BOTTLE by the neck. He notices the bottle in his hands as if for the first time.   Don't feel drunk.  Leonard looks up from the VODKA BOTTLE, sighs, rubs his face, then stands up. He SNIFFS at his armpit.  He puts the empty bottle on the counter by the sink, then wearily UNDRESSES.  Leonard, NAKED, looks in the mirror, then RUNS THE SHOWER then steps under it, shutting the PEBBLED PLASTIC STALL DOOR.  Leonard SHOWERS. He turns the water off, then hears the DOOR BEING UNLOCKED. Leonard freezes, standing in the SHOWER STALL, NAKED and DRIPPING. Through the distortion of the PEBBLED PLASTIC DOOR, Leonard sees a FIGURE enter the bathroom and start pissing into the toilet. The distorted Figure turns and approaches the shower stall, becoming clearer as it gets closer, then YANKS the door open. It is Dodd . He is SHOCKED to see the naked Leonard. Leonard BURSTS out of the shower stall, SMASHING Dodd against the wall.  Dodd STRUGGLES around, grabbing at the SLIPPERY, naked Leonard. Dodd PUSHES against Leonard, SLASMMING him into the sink.  Leonard has his arms around Dodd's neck. Leonard SMASHES Dodd's head sideways into the wall, HARD.  Dodd SLUMPS to the floor. Leonard exhales. Dodd puts a FIST in Leonard's crotch, then GRABS his neck as he doubles over. Dodd uses Leonard to pull himself off the floor then PUNCHES the side of his head and pushes him HARD, Leonard FLAILING wildly, GRABBING THE EMPTY VODKA BOTTLE from by the sink as he falls back into the bedroom. Dodd reaches into his INSIDE  Not just now!  Leonard listens to the maid withdraw her key. Leonard SEARCHES Dodd, finding his GUN in his inside pocket. Leonard examines the weapon, then starts to search the room. Leonard finds an overnight bag at the bottom of the closet. Inside it there are some clothes, spare ammunition, a large hunting knife, and a roll of SILVER ELECTRICAL TAPE.  Leonard WRAPS the electrical tape around Dodd's wrists, then across his mouth. Leonard finishes taping up Dodd, then sits him on the edge of the bed. Leonard takes a POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH of the bloody, taped-up Dodd.  Leonard shoves Dodd into the closet, takes out a NOTE and consults it, then writes \"DODD\" on the white strip on the front of the photograph. He flips the picture over and writes on the strip on the back, in smaller writing:   Ah, it's a message for Teddy...   *  Leonard looks at the note.   I'm at the MOUNTCREST INN on 5th Street, Room 6, and I need you to come over as soon as you get this, it's important. This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.  Leonard hangs up. He looks around the room. He slips the HANDGUN into the bedside drawer, resting it on the GIDEON BIBLE, then swings his feet up onto the bed and lies down.   I'll get the jump on you, fucker.    MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 53.   Is this the guy?  Leonard looks down at his NOTE. The room number given is 6. Leonard looks at the \"9\" on the door, then down at the unconscious man.   Fuck! Sorry.  Leonard reaches down, GRABS his credit card from where it landed on the floor, and backs out of the doorway, shutting the door on the Unconscious Man.  He MOVES QUICKLY to Room 6, slips his credit card in the lock and knocks.  No answer, so Leonard slips inside.  81   INT. DODD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;   81 </colour> Leonard flicks the light on and glances around. There is nothing in the room except an empty VODKA BOTTLE on the bedside table.   Need a weapon.  He grabs the empty vodka bottle, switches the light off and slips into the bathroom.  82   INT. DODD'S MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;    82 </colour> Leonard sits down on the toilet, holding the empty bottle by its neck. He reaches out and adjusts the angle of the door. His eyes are alert, he is nervous. Waiting. And waiting.   What the fuck am I doing?  Leonard glances to his right, and through a GAP between two trailers he catches a glimpse of Dodd on the other side of the trailer homes, RACING along parallel to Leonard.   Chasing him!  Leonard CUTS down the next gap between trailers, heading FULL SPEED for Dodd's side.  Dodd  appears again at the other end of the gap, SEES Leonard, and STARTS RUNNING TOWARDS HIM. There is a GUN in his hand.   FUCK! He's chasing me.  Leonard SKIDS to a halt and turns around. A BULLET hits the dirt by his feet. He clears the end of the trailer and THROWS himself over a chain link fence, dropping down on the other side and SCRAMBLING through some bushes. He RACES full tilt into a parking lot, looking around, desperate. He can hear a CAR ALARM sounding. He pulls his KEYS OUT and hits the ALARM switch. Hearing the DOUBLE BEEP as the alarm stops, he spots the Jaguar.  The Jaguar PEELS OUT just as Dodd emerges from the trailer park.  85   INT. JAGUAR - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;    85 </colour> Leonard is breathing hard, looking around nervously. He starts knocking BITS OF BROKEN WINDOW GLASS out of the driver's side window with his elbow then pulling photos and pieces of paper out of his pockets as he drives.  Leonard finds a NOTE that gives a description of Dodd, along with the motel and room number where Dodd is staying.    Don't be too hard on yourself.  Dodd motions for Leonard to open the passenger side door.  Dodd gets into the passenger seat, gun on Leonard. Leonard nods to him.   Seat belt.  Leonard starts to reach over his left shoulder with his right hand as if for the seat belt. Dodd watches Leonard's right hand.  With his left hand, Leonard opens the door. He rolls out, SLAMMING the door in Dodd's face, and hitting the central locking on his car keys.  Leonard TAKES OFF across the asphalt. Dodd tries the doors, then SHOOTS at Leonard, SHATTERING the driver's side window, triggering the CAR ALARM.  Dodd climbs through the window and takes off after him.  Leonard slips into a trailer park, TRIPPING as he DIVES into a gap between two trailers, STUMBLING over the PLASTIC LAWN FURNITURE and OLD BIKES which litter the narrow gap.  He picks himself up and SPRINTS into the alley behind the trailers. He races along behind the trailers.  Leonard is RUNNING FURIOUSLY, arms pumping.  LEONARD (cont'd) What the fuck am I doing?

He puts the bra on the fire, then pulls some BLACK HAIR out of the hairbrush. He holds a few strands out above the fire until they shrivel up in the heat. He does this with a larger clump and it produces a SMALL FLAME so he DROPS it into the fire.   Probably tried this before. Probably burned truckloads of your stuff. Can't remember to forget you.  He DROPS the brush onto the fire, pulls a GREEN ALARM CLOCK out of the bag and adds it to the fire. Once the bag is EMPTY, Leonard places it on the fire. He sits looking at the flames.   Do I know this guy?  Leonard fishes photographs out of his pocket, examining them. The Landcruiser ACCELERATES until it is uncomfortably close. Leonard slows, turning into a PARKING LOT. The Landcruiser follows.   He seems to know me.  The Landcruiser PULLS ALONGSIDE the Jaguar. Leonard looks over. Dodd  is at the wheel. Leonard rolls down his window.   What the fuck!  Dodd pulls out a HASNDGUN and points it at Leonard. Leonard SLAMS on the brakes, JERKING to a halt as the Landcruiser pulls over in front of the Jaguar.  98   EXT.

Well, sir, that would certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries. Yeah, I was hoping to get more on the drugs angle. Hang on a second.  Leonard drops the needle/pen, pulls a LARGE FILE out of his sports bag and opens it on the bed.   The police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house. The car was stolen, but his prints were all over it, along with some of his stuff. And I think there's something...  Something about a syringe...  I've got a copy of the police report.

DISCOUNT INN - ROOM 304 - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;  112 </colour> Leonard enters the unoccupied room, flapping the Polaroid photo. He sifts through his sports bag, pulls out a pen and writes the motel's address on the picture.  With well-practiced, efficient movements, Leonard removes his wall chart from the sports bag, unrolls it, sticks it to the wall. He takes a stack of Polaroids out of the sports bag and works through them, considering each new picture and finding its proper place on the chart like someone playing solitaire.   None? Okay, blonde. Yeah, blonde is fine. Discount Inn, 304. Leonard.  *   It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.  The Blonde turns, surprised. Leonard smiles, embarrassed.   No, you just go into the bathroom. We go to bed, you wait till I fall asleep, then you go into the bathroom and slam the door.   Just loud enough to wake me up.   That's it.  Leonard gets up, pulls a paper shopping bag out of the closet and hands it to the Blonde.   But, first I need you to put these things around.  The Blonde looks confused.   Just pretend these things are yours, and this is your bedroom.  The Blonde pulls a bra out of the bag.    MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 64.  No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.   No! No, don't use it, you, I mean it's... you just have to put it where you would if it were yours.  The Blonde sees the BLACK HAIR stuck in the brush.  113  INT. DISCOUNT INN ROOM 304 - NIGHT &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;  113 </colour> The lights are off. The Blonde and Leonard are lying side by side in bed.  The Blonde checks to see that Leonard is asleep, then slips out of bed. She grabs her purse then opens the bathroom door. She looks back at Leonard, asleep. She moves into the bathroom and shuts the door firmly, making a LOUD BANG.  Leonard's EYES OPEN.   The drugs stashed in the car doesn't ring true for me.  Leonard consults his FILE CARD, which says:   The police figure the guy was an addict needing money to score, but I'm not convinced. He's not gonna be breaking in when he's still got a stash that big.    MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 65.    I think John G. left it or planted it.  Well, it was a lot for one guy's personal use.  How do you know that?  Right, that's true. It fits.  Too much for personal use, so he deals.  Leonard takes his pen and alters his FILE CARD to read:   Who the fuck are you?   Prove it.   What are you doing in my car?  Teddy is now wearing his big grin, rubbing his neck.    66.   Unfinished business.   Who's she?  Teddy chuckles.   Why's that?   What do you mean \"bad news\"?   Why should I care?  Teddy starts writing on the BEER MAT.   From who?   Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?   Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99  68.   Why are you following me?   Happy now?   Why?   What sort of questions?   Like what?   I have money.       69.   My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.   Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -   I didn't sell -   Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.    Fuck it. I need my own place.  Leonard starts the engine.  116  EXT. DISCOUNT INN - DAY &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt;   116 </colour> Leonard pulls up in his Jaguar, checks the name of the motel against the note written on the BEER MAT, then heads into the office to check in.  Leonard comes out of the office, takes a Polaroid of the front of the motel, and heads for Room 304.   I can't blame the cops for not taking me seriously. This is a difficult condition for people to understand. I mean look at Sammy Jankis. His own wife couldn't deal with it.   MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 71.    I told you about how she tried to get him to snap out of it?  It got much worse than that. Eventually Sammy's wife came to see me at the office, and I found out all kinds of shit.  She knew that I was the one who had built he case for Sammy faking it.    Leonard, in a CHEAP SUIT AND TIE, gets up from behind his desk to shake hands with Mrs. Jankis. They talk, Leonard nodding as he listens. Mrs. Jankis is crying.   She told me about life with Sammy, how she'd treated him. It had got to the point where she'd get Sammy to hide food all around the house, then stop feeding him to see if his hunger would make him remember where he'd hidden the stuff. She wasn't a cruel person, she just wanted her old Sammy back.  The tearful Mrs. Jankis gives Leonard a determined look.   Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is \"faking\" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -   We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.   Then why are you here?   72.   Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?    I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.   She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.  Leonard puts the NEEDLE/PEN down, and wipes blood from his new, homemade TATTOO, which says:   I thought she just needed some kind of answer.    MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 73.   I didn't think it was important to her what the answer was, just that she had one to believe.  Leonard notices the BANDAGE on his LEFT ARM. He starts* fiddling with the TAPE, peeling back the corners.   What happened?  Natalie, intensely AGITATED, FUMBLES with things in her purse.   Who?   Why?  Natalie turns to him, ENRAGED.   Calm down.  Natalie starts to HIT Leonard. He takes her arms.    Take it easy. You're safe now. You're safe.  He sits her down on the couch.   Let's get some ice on your face.   And what did he say?   Where is he?   I'll go see him.   Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.    My wife used to call me Lenny.   Yeah, I hated it.   I'll take care of it. Just tell me what he looks like, and where I can find him. Do you have a pen?  Natalie gets a pen out of her purse and hands it to him.   Me? Why would he be interested in me?   Why would you do that?   Just write it all down. What he looks  * like, where I find him. *   MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99  No, she shouldn't have given me that responsibility. Shit, I'm not a doctor, I'm a claims investigator.  Leonard crooks his neck to hold the receiver between ear and shoulder and FIDDLES with the BANDAGE ON HIS LEFT ARM,* starting to peel back the tape, t.zying to look under the cotton pad.   I suppose, but I've got all sorts of other considerations.  Leonard starts to REMOVE THE BANDAGE.   Legal responsibility, and large financial...    Who is this?  He takes the receiver away from his ear as if the caller has just hung up.   What's wrong?   Who?   What does he want?   Did you?   What's this all about?  Natalie looks at him bitterly.   I have this condition -      78.   What happened?   Neither do I.   I'm not.   How?   What?   What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.   That's different.    79.   Don't talk about my wife.   Calm down.   Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.   Yes.   Shut the fuck up!  Natalie gets right in his face, grinning.   Don't say another fucking word!   What happened?  Natalie, intensely AGITATED, FUMBLES with things in her purse.   Front desk? Burt, right. Well, this is Mr. Shelby in Room 21. I don't want any* calls, none at all, got it? Thanks.    *          * Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -*   They're not looking for him.   They don't think he exists.  Natalie looks confused.   I told them what I remembered. I was asleep, something woke me up...  CUT TO FLASHBACK &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt; </colour> 127  INT. LEONARD'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt; 127 </colour> Leonard opens his eyes. He slides his hand over to the empty space on the bed beside him, feeling the sheet.   Her side of the bed was cold. She'd been    * out of bed for a while.  Leonard sits up in bed, listening.   NIGHT &lt;<colour sequence=\"\">&gt; </colour> We move down the hail towards a closed door. Shadows and   * light play across the floorboards from the gap under the   * door. An ominous rumbling builds. *   There had to be a second man. I was struck from behind, I remember. It's about the last thing I do remember. But* the police didn't believe me.       (points at conclusions on back* of file) * John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage. *  Natalie watches him.    *   Thank you.    MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.   Oh, one thing.  Natalie TURNS. Leonard snaps her picture with his Polaroid camera. He lowers the camera and smiles.   Something to remember you by.  Natalie smiles unconvincingly, perturbed, and exits. Leonard sits down on the couch and writes \"Natalie\" on the white strip under her photo as it develops into the blurred image of Natalie which we have seen before. He takes out his other Polaroids, flipping through them.   What's wrong?   Yeah?     MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 86.   That's right I did, didn't I?   A cop?         * I'm not too good on the phone. I need to    * look people in the eye when I talk to  * them.    *  Burt shrugs, then walks off. *   Thanks.  Natalie watches in fascination as Leonard drinks from the mug. The Drunk is giggling.    Nobody's perfect.  Natalie leans in close, studying Leonard, looking him over.    Leonard looks at Natalie.   My wife.   Dying.   I remember my wife dying.  Natalie picks up the silver tankard from the table.   Beer, please.   A BEER, please.   There's a dress code?   I'm meeting someone called Natalie.   Oh. But haven't we met before?  Natalie slowly shakes her head. Leonard is confused.   So why am I here?   I don't remember. See, I have no short-* term memory. It's not amnesia -   *         MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 90.   How do you know about me?   Who's your boyfriend?   Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.   My name's Leonard. *   I don't know.  Natalie stares at Leonard. Her look softens, becoming almost pleading.   I don't know. I'm sorry.   I can't make new memories. Everything  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.   Found it in my pocket.  Natalie takes it, staring at it, emotional.   Thank-you.  Leonard raises the tankard to his lips.        * What do you want?  *      * I know you're a cop, but what do you   * want? Did I do something wrong?   *        * No, but I can't remember things I do. I* don't know what I just did.

She gets up to leave. Leonard just sits there.   I never said he was faking. Just that his condition was mental, not physical. She seemed satisfied, she just said \"thanks\" and got up to leave. I found out later that she went home and gave Sammy his final exam.   She knew beyond doubt that he loved her, so she found a way to test him.  Sammy injects the insulin, then withdraws the needle, smiles reassuringly at his wife and goes back into the kitchen.  Mrs. Jankis watches Sammy flipping through the channels, looking for commercials.  She sets her watch back by fifteen minutes.   She really thought she would call his bluff...

Sammy strokes Mrs. Jankis' cheek, crying.   He's been in a home ever since. He doesn't even know his wife is dead.   Sammy's brain didn't respond to   * conditioning, but he was no con man.   * When his wife looked into his eyes she * thought he could be the same as he ever* was.

So instead, I got you a bell. I think I may have had to pawn your watch to buy it, but what the hell did you need a watch for, anyway?  You're probably asking yourself, Why a bell? In fact, I'm guessing you're going to be asking yourself that question every time you find it in your pocket. Too many of these letters now. Too many for you to dig back into every time you want to know the answer to some little question.  It's a joke, actually. A practical joke. But think of it this way: I'm not really laughing at you so much as with you.  I'd like to think that every time you take it out of your pocket and wonder, Why do I have this bell? a little part of you, a little piece of your broken brain, will remember and laugh, like I'm laughing now.  Besides, you do know the answer. It was something you learned before. So if you think about it, you'll know.  Back in the old days, people were obsessed with the fear of being buried alive. You remember now? Medical science not being quite what it is today, it wasn't uncommon for people to suddenly wake up in a casket. So rich folks had their coffins outfitted with breathing tubes. Little tubes running up to the mud above so that if someone woke up when they weren't supposed to, they wouldn't run out of oxygen. Now, they must have tested this out and realized that you could shout yourself hoarse through the tube, but it was too narrow to carry much noise. Not enough to attract attention, at least. So a string was run up the tube to a little bell attached to the headstone. If a dead person came back to life, all he had to do was ring his little bell till someone came and dug him up again.  I'm laughing now, picturing you on a bus or maybe in a fast-food restaurant, reaching into your pocket and finding your little bell and wondering to yourself where it came from, why you have it. Maybe you'll even ring it.  Happy birthday, buddy.  I don't know who figured out the solution to our mutual problem, so I don't know whether to congratulate you or me. A bit of a lifestyle change, admittedly, but an elegant solution, nonetheless.  Look to yourself for the answer.  That sounds like something out of a Hallmark card. I don't know when you thought it up, but my hat's off to you. Not that you know what the hell I'm talking about. But, honestly, a real brainstorm. After all, everybody else needs mirrors to remind themselves who they are. You're no different.  ***  THE LITTLE MECHANICAL VOICE PAUSES, then repeats itself.

The TV is still on, blobs of flesh color nattering away at each other. Earl lies back down and is surprised to see himself, older now, tanned, the hair pulling away from his head like solar flares. The mirror on the ceiling is cracked, the silver fading increases. Earl continues to stare at himself, astonished by what he sees. He is fully dressed, but the clothes are old, threadbare in places.  Earl feels the familiar spot on his left wrist for his watch, but it's gone. He looks down from the mirror to his arm. It is bare and the skin has changed to an even tan, as if he never owned a watch in the first place. The skin is even in color except for the solid black arrow on the inside of Earl's wrist, pointing up his shirtsleeve. He stares at the arrow for a moment. Perhaps he doesn't try to rub it off anymore. He rolls up his sleeve.  The arrow points to a sentence tattooed along Earl's inner arm. Earl reads the sentence once, maybe twice. Another arrow picks up at the beginning of the sentence, points farther up Earl's arm, disappearing under the rolled-up shirtsleeve. He unbuttons his shirt.  Looking down on his chest, he can make out the shapes but cannot bring them into focus, so he looks up at the mirror above him.  The arrow leads up Earl's arm, crosses at the shoulder, and descends onto his upper torso, terminating at a picture of a man's face that occupies most of his chest. The face is that of a large man, balding, with a mustache and a goatee. It is a particular face, but like a police sketch it has a certain unreal quality.  The rest of his upper torso is covered in words, phrases, bits of information, and instructions, all of them written backward on Earl, forward in the mirror.  EventuallyEarl sits up, buttons his shirt, and crosses to the desk. He takes out a pen and a piece of notepaper from the desk drawer, sits, and begins to write.  ***  I don't know where you'll be when you read this. I'm not even sure if you'll bother to read this. I guess you don't need to.  It's a shame, really, that you and I will never meet. But, like the song says, \"By the time you read this note, I'll be gone.\"  We're so close now. That's the way it feels. So many pieces put together, spelled out. I guess it's just a matter of time until you find him.  Who knows what we've done to get here? Must be a hell of a story, if only you could remember any of it. I guess it's better that you can't.  I had a thought just now. Maybe you'll find it useful.  Everybody is waiting for the end to come, but what if it already passed us by? What if the final joke of Judgment Day was that it had already come and gone and we were none the wiser? Apocalypse arrives quietly; the chosen are herded off to heaven, and the rest of us, the ones who failed the test,  just keep on going, oblivious. Dead already,  wandering around long after the gods have stopped keeping score, still optimistic about the future.  I guess if that's true, then it doesn't matter what you do. No expectations. If you can't find him, then it doesn't matter, because nothing matters. And if you do find him, then you can kill him without worrying about the consequences. Because there are no consequences.  That's what I'm thinking about right now, in this scrappy little room. Framed pictures of ships on the wall. I don't know, obviously, but if I had to guess, I'd say we're somewhere up the coast. If you're wondering why your left arm is five shades browner than your right, I don't know what to tell you. I guess we must have been driving for a while. And, no, I don't know what happened to your watch.  And all these keys: I have no idea. Not a one that I recognize. Car keys and house keys and the little fiddly keys for padlocks. What have we been up to?  I wonder if he'll feel stupid when you find him. Tracked down by the ten-minute man.  Assassinated by a vegetable.  I'll be gone in a moment. I'll put down the pen, close my eyes, and then you can read this through if you want.  I just wanted you to know that I'm proud of you. No one who matters is left to say it. No one left is going to want to.  EARL'S EYES ARE WIDE OPEN, staring through the window of the car. Smiling eyes. Smiling through the window at the crowd gathering across the street. The crowd gathering around the body in the doorway. The body emptying slowly across the sidewalk and into the storm drain.  ***  A stocky guy, facedown, eyes open. Balding head, goatee. In death, as in police sketches, faces tend to look the same. This is definitely somebody in particular. But really, it could be anybody.  Earl is still smiling at the body as the car pulls away from the curb. The car? Who's to say? Maybe it's a police cruiser. Maybe it's just a taxi.  As the car is swallowed into traffic, Earl's eyes continue to shine out into the night, watching the body until it disappears into a circle of concerned pedestrians. He chuckles to himself as the car continues to make distance between him and the growing crowd.  Earl's smile fades a little. Something has occurred to him. He begins to pat down his pockets; leisurely at first, like a man looking for his keys, then a little more desperately. Maybe his progress is impeded by a set of handcuffs. He begins to empty the contents of his pockets out onto the seat next to him. Some money. A bunch of keys. Scraps of paper.  A round metal lump rolls out of his pocket and slides across the vinyl seat.  Earl is frantic now. He hammers at the plastic divider between him and the driver, begging the man for a pen. Perhaps the cabbie doesn't speak much English. Perhaps the cop isn't in the habit of talking to suspects. Either way, the divider between the man in front and the man behind remains closed. A pen is not forthcoming.  The car hits a pothole, and Earl blinks at his reflection in the rearview mirror. He is calm now. The driver makes another corner, and the metal lump slides back over to rest against Earl's leg with a little jingle. He picks it up and looks at it,  curious now. It is a little bell. A little metal bell. Inscribed on it are his name and a set of dates. He recognizes the first one: the year in which he was born. But the second date means nothing to him. Nothing at all.  As he turns the bell over in his hands, he notices the empty space on his wrist where his watch used to sit. There is a little arrow there, pointing up his arm. Earl looks at the arrow, then begins to roll up his sleeve.  ***  \"You'd be late for your own funeral,\" she'd say. Remember? The more I think about it, the more trite that seems. What kind of idiot, after all, is in any kind of rush to get to the end of his own story?  And how would I know if I were late,  anyway? I don't have a watch anymore. I don't know what we did with it.  What the hell do you need a watch for,  anyway? It was an antique. Deadweight tugging at your wrist. Symbol of the old you. The you that believed in time.  No. Scratch that. It's not so much that you've lost your faith in time as that time has lost its faith in you. And who needs it,  anyway? Who wants to be one of those saps living in the safety of the future, in the safety of the moment after the moment in which they felt something powerful? Living in the next moment, in which they feel nothing. Crawling down the hands of the clock, away from the people who did unspeakable things to them. Believing the lie that time will heal all wounds-which is just a nice way of saying that time deadens us.  But you're different. You're more perfect.  Time is three things for most people, but for you, for us, just one. A singularity. One moment. This moment. Like you're the center of the clock, the axis on which the hands turn. Time moves about you but never moves you. It has lost its ability to affect you. What is it they say? That time is theft? But not for you. Close your eyes and you can start all over again. Conjure up that necessary emotion, fresh as roses.  Time is an absurdity. An abstraction. The only thing that matters is this moment. This moment a million times over. You have to trust me. If this moment is repeated enough, if you keep trying-and you have to keep trying-eventually you will come across the next item on your list.  End.  </colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour> </html>",
