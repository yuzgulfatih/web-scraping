He wipes his fingers along the scratch on his face. He looks -at t em. There's blood on hisï¿½4ingertips. Billy looks at Mogwai. The creature looks at Billy. It giggles.     Shut up. Mogwai stops singing. Billy goes back to his writing. Mogwai.hops from the shelf. Staying out of the direct light, the creature moves across the desktop and cuddles up to Billy's arm. He jumps back.  Get off of me. Mogwai just looks at him.  Get.off`my desk. Billy shines the bright.desk light into the creature's eyes. Mogwai screams and jumps. off the desk, to the floor. Billy looks down at the creature.     24 41  Stay down there. Billy goes back to his work. Mogwai is-bored. The creature leaps up to the bed.. It sees the sword. Mogwai lifts one end, examining it. It's too heavy. The sword slips off the bed and falls to the floor. Billy turns. Mogwai takes a step back. Guilty. Frightened. Billy picks up the sword. The handle is chipped.   You stupid little... Billy raises the sword over.Mogwai. He's ready to kill the tiny creature. Mogwai loo] .s up at Billy. The creature is shivering. It is frightened. It's big, green eyes are watery.

I.just might have a chance with you?        Want some?  A present from my Dad. Pete picks up the creature and pets it. Pete likes Mogwai.  I dunno, Pete...  They must only multiply with plain tap water.   Huh? Well, yeah. I guess so. Pete grabs one of the creatures, taking it from the group. It cries out. In a high, piercing scream. The other creatures leap at Pete. They grab the creature and bring it back to their group.  Dad...We don't know anything about these things.  Yeah, but isn't that pretty weird? I mean, if I throw water onï¿½Barney over there, we're not gonna;getjten copies. A creature licks Rand's ear. He chuckles.  Huh?   Oh, Christ. C'mo'i,Dad...that's ...

Well, you're the closest thing this town's got to a scientist... and I need some information about an animal.  That's what I'm trying to figure out.  The curtains are drawn. The lights are dim. The eight creatures are on the desk top. Giggling. Humming in falsetto. Billy enters with Roy and Pete. Roy stares at the creatures. He is shocked. Delighted.     33  Watch this. Billy squeezes a drop of water on one creature. Mogwa' lets out a scream. A lump appears on the creature's back. The lump gets bigger...bigger...bigger ... Roy watches with wide eyes.

He raises it over his head and swings down, hard. Against the pod. The bat snaps in two. The pod is unblemished. Rand rubs his stinging hands. Billy and Rand just look at each other. Puzzled.  Why did they attack my dog?     Screw'science. I want them des- troyed.   Dad, they killed Barney. Or have you already forgotten? Rand just looks'at his son. Lynn pops a valium in the background.     39.  Now what do we do?  I don't think we should wait. Let's do it ourselves.  A doubtful, uncertain expression on his face.     40.  Next.

Billy climbs the stairs. At the top, he quickly flips on the bright hall light. Something darts up into the darkness of the attic. Escap- ing the light. Billy spots the open attic door. He walks beneath it. He looks up into the dark attic.   Mom?...  He clutches his sword. Tight. Two creatures leap at him. He spears one in mid-air. He quickly spins around, knocking the other Mogwai to the ground. He stabs the creature in the throat. He twists the sword until Mogwai chokes to death on its own blood. The remaining creature attaches itself to Billy's leg. It takes a bite from his calf. Billy cries out in pair. Mogwai stays on. Biting hard. Billy kicks his leg near the fireplace. Scared of the firelight, Mogwai lets go. Billy stabs the creature.. He holds Mogwai in the roaring flames of the fireplace. Mogwai screams until it burns to a crisp. Billy removes his steaming sword. The charred creature collapses into the flames. Dead. Billy checks his leg. A small bite. He walks to the kitchen.     53.  Yes, could you connect me with the Sheriff's Office?...

She looks out the window..  I'll get him out. Billy quickly opens the police car door. He jumps out.  He's dead. Tears fill Gary's eyes. Billy leads Gary to the car.  C'mon. Just stay in the light. They're afraid of the light. Gary walks. He looks scared. Helpless. They get to the police car. Billy opens the door.  We're just outside of town... Doesn't look like the creature's got here yet.  Let's go inside and warm up. They exit the police car.  .and they originate from this marketplace in Hong Kong. Dorrystands and shakes his head.   You see...they''re drawn to water. Now, if my hunch is correct... They'll be leaving town, and heading for the water tower-which means they'll have to pass by here tonight.  We have to get help. These things have to be kept under control. If they get to the water tower .they maybe the Country. They're like inhuman divining rods.  I did. But nobody would listen.  That's not true.

Everyone else wakes from the sound.  (looking at their scared faces Everything's okay...I just dropped my sword. Gary rubs his eyes.  Try. the phone. .see if we can get help... Dorry walks back inside. Gary flips on a transistor radio that has been sitting on the shelf.  Damn.  How? The nearest town is fifteen miles away.  In this? You won't get far.  And-what happens when it gets dark? ...And you're on the road. Alone. Gary says nothing.  No. We have to stick together and fight these things. At least until we can get help... Tracy folds her arms.  Okay. We 11 get something to eat. , Them we go 1 to wJork.  sit at a table in the rear of the restaurant. Away from the grisly sights.- They eat burgers and fries. Gary takes a bite of his burger and nods to Billy.  It's.possible. But it's more important to get at the creatures. We've got the advantage now. It's daylight.  No...But they're all gathered in one place. And the sun rose before they could make it to the water tower. So they must be holed up between here and there.   Too many windows. Too much light. it's got to be someplace dark. Totally dark.  No. There's too many of them.. They'd need a huge area...  You used to work here, right?  You're coming in with me., You can show me around.  Blow up the theater. Everyone seems puzzled. Billy turns to Gary.  This place has some kind of boiler room...with a furnace... right?   I'll use the gas lines as a bomb. The fire will destroy the creatures. Dorry looks at Billy.  Okay...just remember;.We've got to stick together. And keep close to the flashlight. They're scared of the light. Everyone nods. Gary turns on the flashlight. Tracy takes Billy's hand. Gary is jealous. They enter the theater.  They're inside the theater. The others peer into the window.   How do we get to the boiler room?     97.  Damn. There's too many of those things. They'll- see us.  1 If we could. just distract them... Tracy perks up. â¢TRAC Y- I have an 'idea'.- They look .t her .  Give me your T-shirt. Gary reluctantly takes. off his T-shirt. Billy ties the two shirts together. He winds them into a cord. He finds a connection in the gas line. He begins to pound against it with the handle of his sword. The. sounds of metal ring out.  We have to get out. Fast. Gary points to a rear exit.  Not your gun. There's too many. Use the light. Gary stops shooting and fumbles for his flashlight. A creature leaps atDorry, pinning the old man to the ground. Other creatures attack Dorry. Biting. Scratching. Tearing. Billy picks up his sword and begins to knock the creatures off Dorry. Creatures come at Tracy. She picks up a section of thick lead pipe and bats off the oncoming Mogwai. Gary finally turns on the flashlight beam. It keeps some of the Mogwai at bay. Fire creeps up the T-shirt, getting closer to the gas line. Billy gets all-the creatures off Dorry. More creatures come through the door. Gary gets scared. He drops the flashlight and runs for the rear exit.     100   Get back here! We need you! .Gary runs out, leaving the others alone. Billy and Tracy continue to fight the creatures.  Let's go. Billy picks up Dorry's body. Tracy protects him by batting away any oncoming creatures. They hurry out of the boiler room.  emerge from behind the building. They walk towards Gary. Billy walks up. He's holding Dorry's body. He lowers the body-to the ground. He glares at Gary.  You bastard. You ran out on us. Left us alone. To die. Billy drops his sword and jumps Gary. They fall to the ground. Fighting. Punching.      Wait... He looks out the rear window.  looks at the creature on the back seat. It still cries out in that high pitched scream.   Hear that? He's calling his friends for help. They're following us. As long as he's alive and screaming... they'll come after him.  We can't kill him. He's our bait. We'll be able to lead them away from the water tower.

    "description": "Minature green monsters tear through the small town of Kingston Falls. Hijinks ensue as a mild-mannered bank teller releases these hideous loonies after gaining a new pet and violating two of three simple rules: No water (violated), no food after midnight (violated), and no bright light. Hilarious mayhem and destruction in a town straight out of Norman Rockwell. So, when your washing machine blows up or your TV goes on the fritz, before you call the repair man, turn on all the lights and look under all the beds. 'Cause you never can tell, there just might be a gremlin in your house.—Amazon",
