        "Lynch": "Attention. Please. Office Production is down ten percent this week. I recommend that you all go through your clients' investments for any portfolio adjustments. And don't forget -- double commissions today on our 'A' or better bond funds. (looking in Bud and Marv's direction Especially you rookies. Also, remember, the sales contest ends tomorrow.  Bud and Marvin roll their eyes. The digital clock flashes 9:30. The CREDITS close.   Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?   Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.  Lynce hangs up and glares at Bud.   If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.   Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.   Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.  Lynch walks off. Bud does some quick calculations in his head.   Where you been the last 3 hours, Fox? I wouldn't be sitting around chin wagging if I were you... plenty of names in that phone book to cold call...  Marvin gives Lynch the Italian salute, behind his back. Grudgingly, Buddy flips open the massive New York phone book.   Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?   New research report on GM and a conference call on defense stocks at my office at 11. No RSVP required, just be there. And on an inspiring note I'm pleased to announce the new office record for a single month's gross commission goes to Bud Fox. Who more than doubled the old mark. Way to go Bud. Super job! Come on up here.  As Dan Rickey passes him during this, Bud catches a glimpse of the older man's eyes. Dan tries to look brave. Heads turning to Bud with awe and envy...   Come in, Bud...    Congratulations. This is yours now... your own file cabinets... a window ... your private secretary, Janet,  significantly more attractive.   No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.  He winks and leaves. Charlie Cushing comes in, Marv sticks his head in the doorway, a grudging smile.",
        "Dan": "Driving towards the Federal Courtrooms in Lower Manhattan. Busy traffic all around.",
        "Natalie": "Mr. Fox, I've told you before, I'm sure you're a good broker, but our traders talk to the brokers, Mr. Gekko only deals with investment bankers. Yes, I shall give him your message ...  As they're speaking, another SECRETARY leads two well-heeled JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN past her desk. As she opens the door to the inner office and ushers them inside, we catch a glimpse of a figure, pacing back and forth, talking animatedly on the phone by the huge corner window. HE IS GORDON GEKKO. We hear a deafening ROAR as we:    ...all right, send him in...    What are you doing here?   First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?  Bud takes out an old crumpled Fortune magazine cover of Gordon Gekko, entitled \"Gekko the Great!\"    Stay here, I'll see what I can do.  She takes the gift and enters Gekko's office. Bud paces nervously. Natalie re-appears, stern, but a note of compromise in her voice.   Wait outside.   Five minutes...  Bud brightens, pumping himself in the mirror, muttering.   Mr. Stevenson in San Fransisco.  Gekko takes the call, cutting Bud off.    ...have a nice day Mr. Stone. (wrong name, doesn't notice, to Gekko on phone ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.  The phone call goes behind closed doors. Bud walks out, dejected.    Natalie is on the phone. Bud marches past her desk.   Yes, he wants to change that appointment to...  Bud--you can't go in there. He's in a meeting!  He ignores her and throws open Gekko's door.   Mr. Gekko, there's a whole bach of people from Bluestar Airlines outside demanding to see you.",

        "Carolyn": "How you doing Buddy?    Morning Buddy, you look happy.    You were never that innocent sugarpie.   Bud! Where you been the last two days?   He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...",

        "Carl": "... sure and we'll own the airline. If he makes anybody rich, let him make himself rich, so's he can pay off his school loans.  As he signs an unemployment insurance form for one of his men.   ...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...   ... so am I. Whaddaya want, a beer?  Hey Billie, bring another for the kid, he looks good, doesn't he?  Dominick and Charlie go off. A pause. Father and son sizing each other up with a look.   ... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.   Speak English will ya.    I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,   you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.   You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.   I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?   So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...    It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?   ...Got a 100 on me, you...   ... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never... (cuts off when he sees Buddy's face ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...    ...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.   (lights another cigarette, grimaces ...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right.  He gives the signed form back to the injured man. (Carl: \"Okay, Frank\"   Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.   About what?   Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.  Bud's mind racing elsewhere.   What brings you out here...    Don't start, alright.   Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?  Bud takes out his wallet, smiles, peels out 10 $100 bills.    Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.    ...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.   What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.  Buddy forces the money into his hand.   Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.   Whatever night you like.    Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.    Well I'll be a lousy Republican.    I know. You're one of the art works that go with the apartment.  Pretty creative. Doesn't look anything like the place my son bought a few months age.   I met them before you were born.  They exchange nods.    I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?   I guess if a man lives long enough, he gets to see everything. And I mean everything. What else do you have in your bag of tricks, Mr. Gekko?  Bud tenses, looking at his father. Gekko ignores the innuendo and replies softly.   There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.    No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions. (looking at Wilmore and Carpenter I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...    'Course my son did work three summers as a baggage handler and freight loader. With those qualifications, why should I doubt his ability to run an airline?  There is frozen silence at the table.   ...that \"scum\" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...  Carl turns and leaves. Bud glances at Gekko, reading his piercing look. He hurries after his father.   He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.   What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.    Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.   ...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...   I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!   I don't sleep with no whore and I don't wake up with no whore. That's how I live with myself, Buddy. I don't know how you do.  I hope I'm wrong, I'll let them decide for themselves, that much I promise you.  He walks away. Bud watches him go, knows he has won.    You speak for me, son.    Carl, dressed in a suit and tie, sits at the dining table, finished breakfast plates in front of him, refilling his coffee cup. Mom clearing off the table, anxious...  As Bud walks in, wearing a suit and tie. He looks tired, beaten, the eyes lifeless, in a dark mood.   Another cup of coffee?    I guess it's time to hit the road.    Driving towards the Federal Courtrooms in Lower Manhattan. Busy traffic all around.    ...you told the truth, you gave the money back. All things considered-- in this cockamamie world--you're shooting par...   ...if I was you, I'd think about that Bluestar job Wildman's offered you...    Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...    ...got any friends gonna be there?  As he pulls the car into the curb. The Federal Building, in approaching POV, looms large before them.   So, why don't you get out here and go in with your friend, I'll park the car. Try to be cool, okay?  A last look with his father.",
        "Fox": "Carl, dressed in a suit and tie, sits at the dining table, finished breakfast plates in front of him, refilling his coffee cup. Mom clearing off the table, anxious...

        "Bud": "Why Fox? Why didn't you buy... schmuck?  A car honks, swerving past.   ...sorry, what a fox... funny, the most beautiful girls in the world are always on the street or in elevators, never get to talk to them, shy ... my looks, never had confidence in them ... overcompensating work syndrome... prove your worth with money... 'cept I'm not making any money... (pause, the elevator at another floor, slow ... wonder what all these people are thinking about.  Camera moving slowly again over the eyes. The silence of individual tension reigns over all.   Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...  He slips off his overcoat, flicks some lint off his Paul Stuart $500 suit, and enters the main trading room.  Brokers mill by their desks, gulping coffee, scanning the papers, the quotrons. The digital clock by the big board counter clicks to 9:26 am -- four minutes until the market opens. You can smell the hunger.  Bud takes a deep breath, tosses the newspaper away and struts into the office -- fuck it -- it's a new day.  MOVING past DAN STEEPLES, a flush-faced old-timer, a blue and white Yale tie, with a carnation in his lapel.   Morning, Dan. What's looking good today?   ...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?   ...if I had your looks, better.   ...not that you learned anything, Chunk.  Bud reaches his trading desk, whips open his briefcase and pulls out a computer print-out of last night's homework.   I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.   Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?  His associate, MARVIN, a manicky wise-guy, swivels over his chair from a nearby desk. He gives the charts a quick read.   Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.  LOU MANNHEIM, strolls in, a dignified looking older broker in his late 60's, wearing an old brown brim hat with button down white shirt, narrow tie, very much a picture from another era... a kind humor in his eyes... but obviously ailing in the legs and breath department.    You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...   And they're off and running!  The room rises to a subtle but new energy level with the clatter of the ticker, speakers, teletype machines, newsprinters' Dow Jones and Reuters, phones ringing off the hook. Brokers are shouting orders, running for tickets, dodging each other; it's a controlled riot.    Jack, take 50 Gulf, with a 3/8 top, forget the hundred. What about Delroy? I can go long at 23, let's go long...Conwest Air -- let me check it...  He looks up at the TICKER... stock quotes whizzing by.   Up an eighth. How many you want? It's on the floor.  He writes the order up.  A shot of CHARLIE CUSHING yawning as he half-listens to his customer, resting the phone on his kneecaps.   Hey Howard, I thought you were a gentleman. Sure it's gone down a little bit, but you got the tip from your printer, I didn't... Yeah you did. That's what you said.  I didn't tell you to buy it, why would I tell you to sell it?  No, I can't give it back! Give it back to who? You own it!  No, he's out right now.  As he looks up and winks at Lynch, standing over him.    ... That's what you told us to say.   He's lying.   Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!   I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...    Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.   Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...   Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?   Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.   Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.   Gotta open an account to win the lottery, Dominick. Give me 15,000, you'll have a condo in Florida next Christmas.   ... nice to see you in such a good mood Dad, what'd Mom do, give you fish for dinner? ... You're smoking too much, how many times do you gotta go to the hospital to ...  Carl, inhaling his cigarette, grimaces formidably, terminating the subject.   It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.  Bud sitting down next to him, pats him around the shoulder. Dad, a sarcastic and gruff edge to him, makes a faint smile. He has a genuine affection and pride in his somewhat glamorous son.   Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.   D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.   Coulda been a contender.    Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.    Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.   50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...   It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see...     Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.  Dad reaches into his pocket, looks at his cash. It hurts.    Not in here Dad... please. Later.  Dad shrugs, puts it away.    How's Mom?  Another man comes over with a bandage around his head and a compensation form for Carl to sign. .   ...Work okay?   That's great Dad.    Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad...  They drink. Bud reflects a moment.   You sure about this FAA announcement?   The FAA announcement.    A cramped studio facing an air shaft with bars on the window. Moving across to the sound of the radio alarm going off and the glib tones of a rock D.J. announcing the Met's latest streak ... The walls are papered with stock analyses and graphs, print out pages strewn across the floor. No other semblance of a personal life except clothes haphazardly tossed, Barron's and Fortune magazines. A GIRL's back is all we see, sleeping naked on the bed.  Close on Bud's IBM computer -- his appointment calendar. Bud focusing on an underlined notation: G.G.'s BIRTHDAY.  Bud stares at the clock: 4 a.m. He picks up a prospectus for a chemical company, starts reading.   Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...   ...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.   It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.    Well... life all comes down to a few moments, and this is one of 'em...  He follows Natalie.    How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.    ...got a connection at the airport.  Gekko notes the answer, wrapping the cuff of a state-of-the- art, automatic blood pressure monitor around his arm and starts pumping it up. His aides continue on the phones.   Oh no, no...   I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...   Jackson, Steinem...   ...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.    Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.   Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.    Tarafly...Analysts don't like it. I do. The breakup value is twice the market price. The deal finances itself. Sell off two divisions, keep...  Aiex, knowing the stock, sneers, shares a look with Gekko who looks up at Bud with the first sign of interest.    Bluestar Airlines.  The camera moves on him now, sudden, more intense, in a sense trapping him.   A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...   There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.  Gekko looks up, remotely interested.    I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.  Ollie comes back in, as excited as he ever will get under his rolls of flesh, his voice deadpan.   My home number's on the back...   Well, hope to hear from you, sir.  He turns and heads out the door, still shaken by the revelation he has made passing Susan who hurries in with a dossier.  Gekko glances at it. As Bud leaves, he overhears:   ...thanks Natalie.    Bud comes in, distracted, punches into his quatron. Teldar Paper comes up.    Yeah, but he didn't see me.   ...a dog with fleas.  Lynch, the manager, stalks past with some telexes.    ...gotta read my reports.   ...preferably Lou Mannheim...  Their eyes briefly on LOU MANNHEIM, in his private office, sitting there slumped, thinking, smoking as he watches the quotron.   Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. (hitting the phone with the directory  The pool SECRETARY, GINA, calls out.    Bud Fox.  Bud rears up in his seat. A change. Marvin notices.    The camera tracks around and in on him climactically as the Music Theme rises to ensnare him... We end close on Bud. Dumbstruck.   Yes, sir. Thank you. You won't regret it.  He hangs up, stunned still, rises from his chair, unbuttons his collar and feverishly starts writing the ticket.   Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!    Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.   Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.   I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink?  She looks at him, not quite sure. Is he serious or glib?   Sounds like a french word, what is it?   Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...  Maybe, just maybe she's his! His eyes show it as he hurries back to the bar to order. As he gets the bartender's attention, he turns and sees that she is joined by a MAN who looks as if he stepped out of the pages of GQ. Together they walk away. Stung, Bud watches as the woman of his dreams disappears out the door.   ...I just lost it.    Bud's on the quotron and the phone; the word's spread around the office, he's landed Gekko and brokers drop by his desk to get the lowdown.    What's it at now? Still moving. Great!   (indicating Dan's Yale tie My magic tie, Dan.   Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.    Old values. Buy.  She hears him. As they go, Marvin swivels madly over in his chair.   Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...   All right, I owe you one Marv.    Hi Natalie...lunch at 21?  I'm out the door...  As he springs up to leave, Lynch the manager happens to be strolling by. He nods pleasantly at Buddy.   I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.    Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.  He's seated.   Uh...just a Evian, thank you...  The Maitre d' leaves. Gekko proudly pulls a tiny 3\" by 6\" color television out of his pocket with a 2\" diagonal screen, flips it on to the Dow Jones avarages.   ...I can't even see it...   Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...    No sir, that would've been illegal...    Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.    Excuse me sir.  Gekko rising to leave, the Maitre d' hovering around.    Bud is at his computer when the door bell rings. He's not expecting a visitor. When he opens the door he is knocked for a loop.  A smashing looking LADY in a fitted Chanel suit, ropes of chains, short tight skirt, beautiful long legs, is standing there. Taking in the apartment, she hides her distaste.    Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?   We are?    A stretch limo is parked in front, neighborhood WINOS inspecting it. The CHAUFFEUR opens the back door, as Lisa steps inside, Buddy in tow. The winos clap, howling at her.   So, where are we going?    Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...   Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...  She unzips his fly.   Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.    It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.  As she pulls up her skirt and climbs on top of Buddy.    Buddy, in an obviously new Mort Sills suit, struts past Carolyn at the reception desk, in high spirits.   Any better and I'd be guilty.    ...how do you know? You wish...    Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.    Nice club, Mr. Gekko...    Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand.  Gekko's expression is frightening but cool.    What? How do you know about my father?    Yes...    I'm not just another broker Mr. Gekko. If you give me another chance, I'll prove it to you. I'll go the extra yard for you. One more chance. Please...  Gekko looks back, a beat, walks over to Bud, thrusts his towel hard at his stomach.   'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.    I remember that deal. You were involved?  Gekko shuts off the computer and slides it back into the housing, his eyes taking in the low-volume news.   I don't understand.   Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?   What about hard work?   All right, Mr. Gekko...you got me.  His eyes telling us he is weighed down by chains of guilt.  Gekko smiles, gazes at the twilight skyline, a sudden look of contentment.   Oh shit, don't tell me Mr. Wildman was on board that plane?  My boss is gonna kill me. I was supposed to give him this.  You know where that plane is going?    ...after spending the morning at Kahn, Seidelman -- on the 14th floor, the junk bond department -- where Shane Mora works -- he had lunch at La Cirque with a group of well-dressed heavyset bean- counters... (Gekko voice back: \"the adjectives are redundant, sport\" ...he later stopped off at Morgan. I'd say from all the palm-pressing and sweet smiling going on that Larry got some nice fat financing...  Jesus Christ, he's buying Anacott Steel!   Hey Dad!... Hi ya Charlie... Dominick...  They wave back, Carl climbing down a maintenance stand... lights up a cigarette.   Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...   Alright. Why so pissed?   Yeah, it is. In fact I'm doing great. New client. Whole new league. It's starting to happen Dad. The Big Leagues! You know what I'm saying.  He sticks the cash in his hand.   Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...   Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.   ...then buy yourself a decent bowling jacket so when you take Mom out you don't look like the Roto Rooter man. Come on, for godsakes, that's what money's for. Enjoy yourself...  Touched, his father shakes his head and smiles. He takes it.    ... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?    Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.   ...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?    Bud silent, an intent look on his face, gazing up at the digital clock... as it flicks to 9:30... post time.  Tickers, squawk boxes and shouting erupt.  Bud calls in his order: \"10,000 AN STL 46... and let me know how the options are opening.\"  Music skips along in a revolving madcap fashion.    Bud paces nervously at his desk, looking at his quotron. AN STL appears on the screen, now up to 47. Bud puts in another order.    On Bud, eating a sandwich, eyes glued to the ticker. AN STL has climbed to 48 3/4. Marv stalks by, shouting on the phone. Bud looks away from the ticker, pretending to read a report. When Marv disappears, Bud hastily calls in at 49.    Close on the OFFICE TICKER -- as Anacott Steel hits 50.  Buddy jumps up from his chair, and animatedly crosses to Marv who is on the phone, cold calling.   Anacott Steel. Buy it.  Marv looks at Joe and sees a look on his face that he's never seen before.   Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.   You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.   It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy.    Charlie Cushing's on the phone.    Wanna play some tennis Saturday?    ...you take that Anacott Steel?   ...Blue horseshoe loves Anacott Steel.      Mr. Gekko, I've been trying to reach you. We got the options. We got a good execution on them!  Meanwhile, the kid has no intention of going anywhere and plants his feet and emits the loudest shrieking this side of the fat lady in the opera.    Papers and charts are strewn around, trailing down to a box of take-out pizza and empty beer bottles. Bud has stayed late.   (almost apologetic, speeding on the high of the buy... I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.    ...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.   My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.   Bud Fox. Got some papers for Mr. Gekko to sign.    Sorry, Mr. Gekko.   ...if you'd rather not, Mr. Gekko, I can leave...   Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.   Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.   Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.   Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?  Bud indicates the painting in front of them -- a buffalo skull in the desert by Georgia O'Keefe.   ...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.    You could have a great beach house for that.   Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.   I gather you're a decorator.   Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.   Upper West Side.   Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon. (shifts uncomfortably with his pretension but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.  Bud waits, staring suddenly and deeply into her eyes.   Break it.    You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.  They both laugh.    So. See you Friday.   Only if I want something bad enough.  Her date, Mr. GQ, SAMMY RUSPOLI intersects with Kate. A cultivated European air.    No, I'm afraid I've got to get some work...  Kate noticing the doorbell ringing.    I guess I'll head back...   The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.    \"All warfare is based on deception...\" Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.    Exhausted from the drive back, Bud takes off his sweater and tie and collapses onto the bed, closing his eyes. The phone rings. With a start he wakes and answers it.   Yeah?...    Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.    ...Gordon.   Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?   Nah, she asked the wrong question.   \"What are you thinking?\"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.   Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.   What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?   (equally casual, looks at the walls Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.   Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.   More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?   I need to speak to the owner about some business.    Mr. Panos, I've charted the growth of new office space in the city, and I think you're in the right business at the right time.   I'm impressed with your work and I could use a tax break. This is a growing business. Are you interested in some working capital and a partner?  Panos puts down his sandwich, measuring Bud.    Uh. Wrong office. Sorry...   How much?   Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?   How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.  He laughs, a little sloppy.    Of course.   All's fair in love and war.   I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...  As Kate drifts over with Rudy and the French au pair GIRL,  What's it cost these days?   ...piece of cake, Gordon...   Yeah, almost...  Looks at her, stifles his thought.   The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.   And what do you want?   Well, why stop at that?    You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?  She looks at him, tosses the towel over her shoulder and starts back toward the house. Buddy watches her go.    BROKERS mill at their desks quietly. Bud enters, notices immediately the uneasy silence. His eyes go to Lynch's office... across the windows, he's talking to a very somber Dan Steeples.   What's going on?    ...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.  Bud passes Charlie Cushing, yawning on the phone as usual.   ...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.  Chuck laughs, Bud's \"in\" now. Lynch indicates for Bud to follow him into an outer glass-enclosed office.    Neatly furnished, with a window overlooking Wall Street, and attractive CHINESE SECRETARY filing papers into a cabinet.    Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.   All right. Offer 950...  Sylvie tries to play it cool, her expression conveying a somewhat stunned look at the speed and certainty of the response.   Nah...this is it..home...  Looking it over, proud.    In its first stage, Darien supervising. It's expanse of white walls devoid of mouldings, a blank plaster canvas. The city views are great, the apartment identical to hundreds of other cookie cutter condos. Several young artists are working on a neo-classical mural on the long side of the living room. They are colorfully dressed, listening to a TALKING HEADS tape while they work. A carpenter who looks like a member of Duran Duran is installing a pair of old columns from Urban Archaeology on either side of the entrance to the living room while another fits a brass sink into an antique sideboard which has been turned into a bar.      Yes...no...at 37 1/2. Convert the bonds right...and check the price in Tokyo at 8:00 LA time. Thanks...  4) As he starts his pasta sauce flame an his O'Reilly fat- free grill with a flexible neck fire starter...  5) A freshly heated roll pops out of a hanging space-saving toaster, as Darien works the electric pasta maker while melting the frozen ice cream cartons in the microwave.  6) Bud manages to sneak a kiss an her lips humming the bars from Verdi's \"Rigoletto\" as he works the piece de la resistance--the automatic sushi maker...  7) Dinner is finally served on a demolished dinner table. Red wine, pasta, sushi...it looks perfect, lit by candlelight, the view of the city below.   ...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it.     Bud goes over a stack of bills with something approaching concern as the gothic oak refectory table which seats 20 is carried in, followed by a Jean Michel Basquiat featuring a skull on a rough board. Darien instructs the movers to place an important pair of satinwood Art Deco armchairs upholstered in buttery suede (last Saturday's auction purchase for $20,000) at either end of the titanic sofa. No vestige is left of the cookie cutter space we first saw. Walls have been removed, mouldings and architectural found objects added, imitation rare woods, marbles and frescos have been created from nothing by the magic hands of the tromp l'oeil crew. The point is, decorating can transform.   (dubiously looking at a rough plaster wall of fading fresco You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.   Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.  As he nuzzles her neck, she feels threatened, stops.   I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.   That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...  As the kiss grows, his hands move into her nether regions. She looks at him, sober.   It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world. (he folds back her palms in his ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.    Bud making love to Darien. Camara closing on them.  Her face -- from his point of view. Her smile.  His face -- looking down. Covered with sweat and passion.   Is this real? Is this really real?    Bud walks out alone in his blue bathrobe on his parapet overlooking Central Park. The wind stirs his hair. The East and West sides of the park wrap the city in a diamond necklace of brilliant light.  Bud stares down at the world. He has it all now. The money. The girl. The magic palace apartment. What more is there? Something...because Bud suddenly throws a wrenching dislocated look into himself that makes us wonder as he brushes his hand across his face and mutters to himself.   Who am I?  There is no ready answer. As he finally turns and goes back inside and closes the door.    Darien lies curled in the bed, eyes open, looking at him.   Dixon! It's your lucky day! That's right. I want to give you some stock and you don't have to put up a penny...   No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...    ...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.      ...it's easy Jack! On settlement day, you endorse a check to Blue Horseshoe Trading Company. Then I send you your cut.  Marv waves across the glass partition and knocks. But Bud waves him off, closing the blinds.   ...that's the bottom line. And nobody gets hurt.  Marv now walks it, exasperated.   Hey, I'm tired of playing nurse to you all the time, alright. Do your own home work!  Marvin abruptly walks out, \"asshole!\". Bud books the order for Morning Star Corp -- MSC -- 50,000 June options.    Bud is in silk boxers on the phone, number crunching on the computer, foot pounding to a music beat on the stereo, while his telex spews out overnight currency data.  Darien in the background lies in bed in panties reading Vogue.    Buy me 20 June Euro Dollar CDs. Twenty March gold and sell 10 September Deutsch marks. That's right...  He hangs up, back to the computer a growing look of excitement and revelation in his eyes.  On the computer screen we see a break up Of Bluestar Airlines -- its assets and liabilities.  Bud hits the command key, printing it out. He's exuberant.   Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...   You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.  Bud dances over to the bed turning the stereo down on his way.   I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?   Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.    ...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...   Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.   ...Bluestar's an unpolished gem, Gordon, right out of the garbage. A half assed management being decimated by a price war they can't win. But the gates at LaGuardia alone can bail us out, it's worth 25 bucks a share if it's worth a dime! They're ripe to fall.  Gekko, the poker player, hasn't seen enough cards.   Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...    Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!   Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.    The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...   I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.    Bud, in high gear, all smiles, expensive Armani suit, opens the door. His father stands before him, looking like a man on his way to the dentist.   Dad, well come on in. Everybody's here. We couldn't start the show without you.  Wide-eyed, Carl follows Bud through the foyer, taking in the furnishings, paintings, antiques.   Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...   And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.   Thank you Mr. Gekko. First of all I want you to know my door will always be open to you cause I know from my Dad it's you guys that keep Bluestar flying. One -- Modernize. Our computer software is weak, we update it, we squeeze every dollar out of each seat and mile flown. You don't sell a seat to a guy for $89 when he's willing to pay $389. Effective inventory management through computerization will increase our load factor by 5 to 20%, that translates to approximately 50 to 200 million dollars in revenues; the point is, we can beat the majors at a price war. Two -- Advertising -- more, more, and aggressive, attack the majors. Three -- expand our hubs to Atlanta, North Carolina and Dallas, reorganize all our feeder schedules, think Big -- guys, we're going after the majors!  The men are visibly shaken by Bud's determination.   Now, wait a minute, Dad...    Congratulations. You did a great job of embarrassing me in there-- not to mention yourself! Save the \"workers of the world unite\" speech for next time Dad, I heard it too much growing up. You're gonna get axed Dad, no two ways about it, you and the whole airline are going down the tubes, you hear me, just like Braniff, you don't have a chance in hell, and if it isn't Gekko it's gonna be some other killer.   No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.   That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.    Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.   Your men! All my life \"your men\" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?  They head through the doors, out onto the street.   And what if you're wrong? What if one day, the sun didn't rise in the East and birds didn't fly South in winter and for once in your life your compass was off? Huh?  He grabs Carl by the arm, stopping him.   Would you be willing to wreck your men's future? My future? Please... Dad. Think. Be practical, for a change. I'm asking you, I'm fucking begging you...  Bud lets go of Carl's arm. Carl looks at his son, seeing the desperation. Sadness and confusion take hold of him.    Bud, increasingly frazzled and determined, dark circles under his eyes paces with the phone...    What's up Dixon?  Calm down! What are you talking about?    What'd you tell him?   Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.   Tell 'em your father gave it to you.   They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.   Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.   Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.  He hangs up, a worried expression, Marv entering to break his concentration.    Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?   Then get out and close it behind you.   Get the hell out!  Marv slams the door on his way...   So what's the problem?    ....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...   Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.  A young lawyer pops his head in the room.    He never told me...   I'm sorry, this can't wait.  Gekko stares at him with piercing eyes.   I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?  Gekko is taken by surprise.   Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.   Why do you need to wreck this company?   If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.   Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?    How much is enough Gordon?   Obviously...  As he puts his arm around Bud, leading him to the door.   (at the door, confused, drained ...I can't make it tonight.   I'm with you Gordon...  He walks out the door, the misery he is in washing his brow.    Darien approaches, carrying groceries, enters the building.    Bud is slumped on the couch, a spent bottle of tequila in front of him. Outside the twilight is quickening into night, shadows, scurrying across the unlit room.... for the first time we see him sucking on a cigarette.  Darien opens the door and freezes, surveying the living room. A broken vase on the carpet, a curtain ripped off a window, a painting upended, a chair overturned, selected but not frenzied damage...   I've been played like a grand- piano--by the master, Gekko the Great...and today was the big crash. Liquidation sale. He's gonna carve Bluestar into little pieces and sell it all off...  Darien registering this, is picking up pieces of the broken vase.   Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...    I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.  She stops, lights a cigarette, growing concern.   At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.  She sighs...comes over, tries to shake some sense into him!   I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.    What the hell's that supposed to mean?  Darien moves out from his approximate circle, wrestling with what she wants to say...until she turns and says it.   You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...    I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.  She collects her things and walks to the door.   That's bullshit! Step out that door, I'm changing the locks.  She opens the door saddened.   Get the hell out!  She does. Bud stares at the closed door, mute, numb, totally devastated.... the loss is not just Darien, it is total... He looks at his face in the reflection of a wall mirror...    Waiting for the elevator. Darien also looks at herself a beat in the hall mirror. She's crying. Then she steels herself and enters the elevator.    The same realtor, SYLVIe DRIMMER, who sold him the place, is back. The phone is ringing, unanswered...    Save the rap, just sell it -- fast!  He's in his socks, unshaven, smoking, he looks like he's been on a bender for the weekend. The phone stops ringing. He turns and walks into the bedroom, slamming the door behind him.    Bud walks in, a different, more serious look in his eye, purposeful. Past CAROLYN and JANET at the outer desk. They stop what they're doing and look up at him surprised.   (ignoring the tone in her voice ...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...  He notices her face, something's wrong.    What! What happened?!    Oh Christ!    Bud weaving fast through traffic.    Mom! How is he?   Hiya Dad...  What was it? Mom talked too much or was it her spaghetti? I mean pasta... (Mom bringing a handkerchief to her eyes I told you never to lift a 747 by yourself...  Carl, smiles weakly, on pain killers. Bud pulls out a cigarette. He fumbles with it before putting it away, trying to keep a gruff tone between them.   ...you even got me smoking now...second one Dad, you're pushing your luck, I guess you know that...I guess you gotta pull through this one Dad...for mom, for me...I guess I never told you but...I love you Dad, I love you more than I ever.  ...I didn't mean those things I said to you...you're a hero all the way Dad, you're a rock...the best.  The words seem to come flowing out of Bud as Carl's eyes fill with tears.   ...and you were right about Gekko. He's one son of a bitch...through and through.  Carl stares at him, beginning to understand.   He's gonna break up Bluestar.  Carl reacts violently in his eyes but Bud soothes him...in dead earnest, trying to be deliberate and clear in his meaning.   ...but I gotta plan Dad, it can work, I can save the airline, I know you got no reason to believe me but I want you to trust me...I need to talk to the unions...Can I speak for you?  Carl's eyes.   Your words, not mine...   ...the stock's at 19 1/4 and it's going up. Gekko figures by breaking up Bluestar, it's worth at least $30 a share. That means he'll buy up to 23 or 24 and still think he's making money.    You really don't want to know any more than that, Mr. Wilmore. Let's just say I have some friends.   When the stock hits 23, you guys go to Gekko and lower the boom. Once he learns he has no union concession, he's going to head for the hills. He'll sell everything he's got.   We have an appointment to see Mr. Wildman.   Sir Lawrence, what would you say to owning Bluestar Airlines with union concessions--at $18 a share...and in the process hanging Gordon Gekko out in the wind to twist.... ?  Sir Lawrence leans back in his chair, equably...   Let's just say Mr. Gekko and I have a conflict of interest. I want to see this airline work... (pointing to the documents in front of Wildman ...the figures here show it can.    Bud hurries in, past Marv on the phone with an irate customer.   You don't have to agree with me, Marv; but I think I've been a bit of a schmuck lately.     I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.   Bluestar, Mr. Mannheim. Put all your clients in it.  Davls looks gravely at Bud.    Bud on the phone, checking his quotron.   Listen I need a favor and it's a quick scalp for you. Two hundred thousand at 19 1/2; can you position it in one of your equity funds?   Hold on...  ...listen \"blue horseshoe loves Bluestar Airlines\"...  Immediately goes back to the other line.    The quotron now climbs to 22 1/8!    Yeah. I see it at 22 1/8 and I don't know what to make of it.    All the BROKERS have jumped into the action, avidly watching Bluestar's stock climb on the BROAD TAPE. Bud sweeps into the room and looks up at the board as the stock hits 22 7/8.   Start unloading.   Now! Tell everyone to dump!  Marv nods, and rushes away. Bud crosses past Mannheim's office.   Get out of Bluestar!  In background Marv is spreading the word, brokers frantically grabbing phones, calling clients to sell.    Bud switches lines from Gekko to Larry Wildman.   Gekko's on the ropes--he's trying to sell, but there's not many takers, the stock's plummeting.    Bud scribbling an order ticket, replies on the other end.    You once told me don't get emotional about stock. Gordon, don't. The bid is 17 and going down. As your broker, I advise you to take it.  Bud moves the phone away from his ear, at Gekko's cursing, and signs the ticket.    Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.    He walks past Carolyn the receptionist who is strangely mute...   Smile, Carolyn, there's justice in the world...   How's it going Mr. Mannheim? Got out of Bluestar in time I hope?  Mannheim stops, winds up. Bud impatient but polite.   I think I understand what you mean Mr. Mannheim.  But not really. As, on this increasingly strange morning, he moves on past Janet who wants to tell his something but he cuts her off.   Get my father will you Janet?    As Bud walks in, the camera glides to reveal the young SEC INVESTIGATOR, who has been tracking Buddy, going through his files. A SECOND MAN, PATTERSON, is standing behind the desk using the phone as a bored-looking 3RD MAN and POLICEMAN stand off to the side with Hieronymus Lynch, who gives Bud a withering glance.   I guess you're not here to open an  Gordon.    I don't know. My Dad once told me, \"money is something you need in case you don't die tomortow.\" I guess I realized I'm just Bud Fox. And as much as I wanted to be Gordon Gekko--I'll always be Bud Fox.  He looks at Gordon, as if wanting to say more, but doesn't.  In long shot, Gordon stands alone as Bud walks away.    CLICKING of the Broad Tape grows LOUDER. Shots of Lou Mannheim, Lynch, Marv; silently looking up at the green fluorescent print-out.    No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.   Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.   Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.    Like who? Who really wants to know a convicted felon...I don't even like myself.  Carl knows something Bud doesn't...  Darien is standing there waiting as they approach the main entrance... Bud seeing her, suddenly stunned. His POV-- easing along the curb.   Why?",
        "Lou": "",
        "Mannheim": "Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.   ...but they got a good new drug. Stick to the fundamentals, that's how IBM and Hilton were built...good things sometimes take time.  The stentorian voice of OFFICE MANAGER HIERONYMUS LYNCH booms over the intercom.  We see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit office; tall, balding with a perpetual worried look on his face.    Good little company. I remember when we got the money for Bluestar to build those first planes, back in the fifties.   Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.    No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something? (Bud uncomfortable, Lou reads it Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.   Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.   You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.   I don't know where you get your information, son, but I don't like it. The only reason I'm gonna do it is...I need the money, that's the problem with money--it makes you do things you don't want to do.  Bud hears him, walks on...    Bud I like you, just remember something. Man looks in the abyss, there's nothing staring back at him. At that time a man finds his character--and that is what keeps him out of the abyss...",

        "Gekko": "NATALIE, a classy attractive Englishwoman is on the phone with Bud, somewhat amused by his manner. She is the personal secretary to multimillionaire, Wall Street trader and raider, Gordon Gekko. His windows look out on a panoramic view of the city and East River.    Bud, crossing lower Broadway, enters a magnificent towering glass structure.    NATALIE, Gekko's British secretary, is completing shorthand notes as the intercom buzzes. A logo for \"GEKKO &amp; CO. is behind her.    Bud on the courtesy phone, hangs up, looks nervously at his watch. Almost 12. He's lost some two hours of business. Natalie suddenly comes out, without a smile.

Gekko often shakes his head \"no\".    ... what the hell is going on? I just saw 200,000 shares move, are we part of it, we better be, pal, or I'm gonna eat your lunch for you... get on 1.  Sorry, love it at forty. It's an insult at fifty. Their analysts don't know preferred stock from livestock...  wait for it to head south, then we'll raise the sperm count on the deal... right. Get back to me.... (to Alex, an aide listening an the other line This is the kid that's called me 59 days in a row. Wants to be a player  There oughta be a picture of you in the dictionary under persistence.  Look, Jerry, I'm looking for negative control, no more than 30 to 35%, just enouqh to block anybody else's merger plans and find out from the inside if the books are cooked. If it looks as good as on paper, we're in the kill zone. We lock and load pal...get on 3.  ALEX DE BETANCOURT, a tall handsome Frenchman, jots a note and follows Gordon over to line 3. Gekko's dark intent eyes fixing briefly on Bud who stands waiting in the corner. He motions him to sit.    Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested. (eyes an Quotron, to Ollie, a trader Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!   (back on line with Billy, listening ... check the arbs for MacDonald's. Yeah, I'm having a Mac attack. 20,000 shares. For about 30 minutes. Lunch? Are you joking -- lunch is for wimps. Get back to me...  4.  Bud's eyes on the framed \"tombstones\" from the Wall Street Journal commemorating Gekko's successful deals; they hang like scalps from the walls. Gekko's eyes drifting to Bud, a friendly easy smile for a flick of an instant, he has genuine charm in his manner and though ultrafast verbally, projects calm and confidence at the center. A man who obviously loves what he does, to some small degree is flashing his stuff for the outsider.    Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...    If I ever need surgery, get me the heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's never been used...Happy Holideals Harold...  Hangs up, eyes to Bud. His headset comes off.   So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these?     So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.    Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.   (smiles, impatient with the speech So what firm you with, pal?    ...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.    ...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?   So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?  Bud opens his attache case and rifles out a handful of briefs. Gekko noting the blood pressure reading and taking the cuff off his arm. Ollie, the big trader, ambles back in, says something to the third aide, a young intelligent- looking woman SUSAN TURNER.   It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?   He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.   ...doesn't look like it but the best trader on the street...  Sue get the LBO analysis on Teldar Paper and bring it here...what else?  Bud shifting, uncomfortable as Gekko finally swivels his attention back to him.    Not bad for a quant, but a dog with different fleas.  Come on, tell me something I don't know. It's my birthday, pal, surprise me...  As he opens a birthday card and feeds it into the SHREDDER that sits next to his desk over the waste basket. The sound it makes is soft and menacing. Buddy knows its fourth down and long, Gekko's attention is shifting to the quotron. In frustration, Bud blurts it out.   ...rings a bell somewhere. So what?   ...don't like airlines, lousy unions...   How do you know?   Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.   Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?  Buddy thrusts a card into his hands. Gekko glances at it.    Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.  Bud stuffs his notes back into the briefcase, hoping for a word of encouragement in the awkward silence.    OK gang, looks like we're going over 5% in Teldar, start the lawyers on a tender offer and 13D, we keep going after everything in sight but don't pay over $22. They're gonna fight, they got Myers and Thromberg doing their legal, they make Nazis look like nice guys...    Bud walks glumly past Natalie, certain that he's blown it. She's busy on the phone.    Gekko talks into his speaker phone, gazing out the window.   Alright Bud Fox... buy me twenty thousand shares of Bluestar. No more than 15 1/8, 3/8 tops, and don't screw it up sport.   Hi sport.   Try the steak tartare. It's off the menu but Louis'll make it for you...   See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...   ...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.    Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.    Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?  As he fishes a check out and drops it on Bud's plate.  Greeting TWO BANKERS who stop at the table as Bud picks up the check, glances at it. His hand starts to tremble.  The check is for $500,000.   (to bus boy, the bankers excited Can we have the check over here for christ's sake.   Cover the Bluestar buy and put a couple hundred thou in one of those bow-wow stocks you mentioned. Pick the dog with the least fleas. Use a stop loss so your downside is 50,000, and buy yourself a decent suit. You can't come in here looking like that.  Go to Morty Sills, Tell 'em I sent you.   (paying the check with cash ...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.   You heard me...I don't like losses sport. Nothing ruins my day more than losses... You do good, you get perks, all kinds of perks. Stay home tonight. Louis, take care of 'im. Enjoy the lunch.  Confused, Bud watches Gekko walk out of the room, pumping extended hands left and right. He holds the cashiers check up to his eyes, entranced by it, like a kid with his first dollar...as the raw steak tartare with an egg on top is put in front of him.    ...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...   ...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...  Meant paternally or sadistically, it's hard to tell. Gekko hits the ball, a big fat shot. Bud returns, Gekka moves him around the court, as if punishing him, the kid exhausted but the ball's never quite out of reach -- till Bud finally can't take it anymore and at the end of his breath, smashes into the wall and collapses. Gekko laughs. Bud lying there like a sad dog as Gekka hauls him up.   The public is out there throwing darts at a board, sport. I don't throw darts at a board. I only bet sure things. Read Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War.\" 'every battle is won before it is ever fought.' Think about it.  He exits the squash court.   Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!   I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.   The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?   You're not as smart as I thought you were, Buddy boy, Listen hard -- don't count on Graham and Dodd to make you a fortune, everybody in the market knows the theory, ever wonder why fund managers can't beat the S&amp;P 500? 'Cause they're sheep -- and the sheep get slaughtered. I been in the business since '69. Most of these high paid MBAs from Harvard never make it. You need a system, discipline, good people, no deal junkies, no toreadores, the deal flow burns most people out by 35. Give me PSHs -- poor, smart and hungry. And no feelings. You don't win 'em all, you don't love 'em all, you keep on fighting, and if you need a friend, get a dog, it's trench warfare out there sport...  and in here too. I got twenty other brokers out there, analyzing Charts. I don't need another one. Talk to you sometime...  He turns to go, Bud panicking. Is this the kissoff?   You want one more chance? Then stop sending me information and start getting me some. Get dressed, I'll show you my charts.    Cruising up Park Avenue. A panel slides open next to the bar with a portable computer on it. A television is turned on to the evening news, a low hum of voices. Gekko punches into the keyboard of the computer. A name appears an the screen... LAWRENCE WILDMAN with curriculum vitae following; address, phones, businesses...   Know the name?    Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.   Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...   Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...    Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...  Bud downs the rest of his drink, upset by the darkening mood. There's something very powerful and frighteninq about Gekko.   What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being \"comfortable\", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??  The car stopping in traffic. Horns honking.    Look out there...  THEIR POV -- a STREET CORNER. A richly dressed EXECUTIVE stands at the curb next to the BUM with a shopping cart filled with garbage.   You really think the difference 'tween this guy and that guy is luck? Mohammed, pull over.  The car pulls over. Gekko checks his watch, pulls out the telephone.   ...when it comes to money, sport, everybody's of the same religion. Or should be... Hope you don't mind if I let you off here, I'm late for a meeting. Good bye, nice knowing you.   Yeah, it's a beautiful night. I love this hot stinkin' city.  ... nothing else like it in the world. Seven million people living on each other's heads, kids born, millionaires dying, people praying, junkies, whores, wills, lawyers, deals, parties, sex... guys like you sport -- dreaming about the big score. You know the best thing about New York is everything you can do here. And the worst thing is everything you can't do here...  He shuts the door. Bud watches as the limo drives off.    Alex and Susan are with him. Gekko playing the computer, eyes lighting up on the phone.   ...bright but not bright enough, Sherlock, roll the dice and play a little monopoly... what box would Sir Lawrence land on in Erie, Pennsylvania?    Gordon already has the closing figures punched up on his quotron. Calls his shot.   When the market opens tomorrow, buy five thousand March fifty calls. You hear me? Start buying ten thousand share blocks and take it up to fifty dollars. When it reaches fifty, you can let out a little taste to your friends. Then call this number -- 555-7617: tell the man \"blue horseshoe loves Anacott Steel...\" You scored, Buddy! Be in touch.    He hangs up, looks at Alex and Susan.   Start buying Anacott Steel all over the board.    Wind and waves. Gekko's modern, Sante Fe structure house sits on a dune overlooking the grey Atlantic.   Sweeten the offer, throw 2 bucks more in a convertible preferred. And 5 year contracts for themselves.    Immense slanted ceilings, a vast clean modern space filled with dozens of contemporary art objects, junk sculptures, floor to ceiling windows radiating light, that look out on a cantilevered deck and pool - and the ocean beyond.    ... Cromwell wants to play financial chicken with me, we'll see who swerves first. Where the hell's Gene?  Gekko slumps down on a sofa, exhausted, watching one of several news reports he master-controls with a remote.   ...done and done. Night gang, and Susan no legs waving in the air tonight. I want you dreaming about Teldar Paper.  During this, RUDY, Gordon's 3 year-old son, drives in in the latest electronic baby toy -- a Porsche-bodied electric car. Gekko hangs up, checks out a Reuters quotron positioned nearby.   Rudy Kazootee, how's my cutie!  The kid jumps out of the car and scoots into his father's lap.   No, not now Rudy. Daddy's making money to buy you toys. Daddy work.    Shut that off, willya!  Kate, upset with the noise, tries to pull her son nicely out of the car.  The Korean HOUSEBOY coming in.    I come to the country and it's worse than the city! I'm not home...  Yeah?   Nicole! Take him will you...  Handing the bawling, writhing mass of anger to Nicole as if it were laundry she doesn't want to touch... Nicole takes him screaming out of the room... Gordon trying to concentrate on the TV.   Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?    I'll be right there, fix them a drink.    You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.    ...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.    Bud's P.O.V. as he pulls up to an austere, ultra- sophisticated monolith of glass and wood dominating a stretch of dune overlooking the Atlantic's angry surf. Several Jags, state of the art Jeeps and a Rolls are drawn up outside.  Bud, getting out of his faded Honda, goes up the stairs to the door. He rings several times.  A BLACK BUTLER opens it and looks at Buddy somewhat warily. Laughter and voices are heard from inside.    Bud enters, as Gekko approaches.  He seems annoyed to be disturbed at his country home.    Allright. Wait here...  About to go when his wife, Kate Gekko, comes over. A pretty dark-haired woman.   No... Bud Fox, my wife, Kate...  They exchange pleasantries.   Yeah, why not, Bud boy...  Kate's walking back inside to her guests, as Bud sidles over to Gekko.    They cross to the main living room.   ...It's okay Buddy, you know Alex... Candice Rogers. (Alex and his date shake hands, faintly aloof ...This is Stone Livingston... and his wife Muffie. (a young stuffy banker in weekend corduroys looks at Bud as if he obviously doesn't belong ...Darien Taylor, Sam Ruspoli, Carmen Winters, Dick Brady... All old friends.  Bud looking wide-eyed at the beautiful \"Calvados\" BLONDE he's been dreaming of for weeks... she's with Mr. GQ and doesn't recognize Bud, nods back, they all nod back, naturally suspicious of the young outsider... Rudy's TOY ROBOT wheels  around the floor with a drink on its tray, talking computer talk...   ...well he doesn't talk back or steal the silver and Dick's gonna get me an exemption on him, aren't you... (Dick Brady is obviously an accountant   Bud plucks a glass of wine from the robot's tray and plunks himself down on a sofa, overhearing the conversation between Muffie Livingston and Candice Rogers.    Make Mr. Livingston a martini would you Nyung, and this gentleman...  Stick around, this could be fun...  He goes to the alcove to take the call.      Larry, what a surprise...  Can it wait till tomorrow. I got some people over.  ...if you feel that way Larry, come over.    The blonde, DARIEN TAYLOR, is examining a modern sculpture as Buddy comes over with two Calvados.    SIR LARRY WILDMAN walks in, his country gentleman clothing somewhat softening his imposing figure but not the cultured rapacious eagle's face. With him a lawyer.   Larry! Excuse me \"sir\" Larry, great to see you again, you're looking good.      Stick around... Larry, one of my \"gang\" -- Bud Fox.  Pleasantries. Bud nervously shakes hands, sensing Wildman might recognize him from being tailed in the elevator. There indeed is a moment but Wildman's attention blurs as...   Shall we go upstairs?    Gordon enters a den lined with old books hunting prints;  he proudly picks up something from his gun collection.   Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.   The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...    You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the \"sir\" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...   Showdowns bore me Larry, neither side wins. You can have the company, in fact it's gonna be fun watching you and your giant ego try to make a horserace out of it...  What do you think is a fair price for our stock Bud?  Bud in the spotlight. The eyes all shift to him -- his moment. After an initial panic, he's cool as a cucumber -- and ruthless as his mentor.   But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.  His eyes to Wildman who looks at him, cold, icy mean.   My mail's the same color as yours Larry. Or it was till the Queen started calling you \"sir\". Now excuse me before I lose my temper...  He rises and exits.   Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.    He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.   You're learning, sport...    The sky is still dark, the first rays of light coming up over the ocean. Gekko, a lonely figure in a windbreaker, restlessly prowls the edge of the beach, waves crashing around him. He's been up all night and has an exhausted, driven look as he whispers over the wind into the cellular phone...   Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.   You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - \"a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar.\" I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.   Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work.  He lets the phone drop to his side, staring glazed-eyed at the ocean.    Gekko on the phone, smiling.    Got him at an auction in Kentucky.    Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.  Darien rides in, smiling to Bud.    They're finishing lunch by the pool framed by a lush flower garden where Kate and son Rudy play. HAROLD SALT, Gekko's chief lawyer, thick glasses, smart eyes and bags of worry that could only come from watching other people's money, looks very city-like in his clothing, examining his paperwork before passing it to Bud, who is the picture of relaxation.   ...just the beginning, sport, just the begining...  Bud smiles, signs.   The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...   Rudy, viens ici, dit bonjour a Monsieur Bud.  Rudy either says \"No!\" or \"Bonjour Monsieur Bud!' depending on the mood of the kid. Gordon sweeping him up and playing with him. The kid squeals with glee.    Already speaks a little French, kid got the highest score on his IQ test.   (rising, finished with lunch Think about incorporating yourself there, Bud, Harold will take care of it for you.  ... at a reasonable fee. You're gonna make a lot of money now Bud... stakes are gonna go up, no mistakes...   Where do you get off speaking about me like that, making remarks to the press, I resent these remarks, I demand the right to speak.   ...I appreciate the chance you're giving me, Mr. Cromwell, as the single largest stockholder in Teldar, to speak. (gets some laughter and applause, loosens On the way here today I saw a bumper sticker. It said, \"Life is a bitch... then you die\".  ...well ladies and gentlemen, we're not here to indulge in fantasies, but in political and economic reality. America has become a second rate power. Our trade deficit and fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions. In the days of the 'free market' when our country was a top industrial power, there was accountability to the shareholders. The Carnegies, the Mellons, the man who built this industrial empire, made sure of it because it was their money at stake. Today management has no stake in the company. Altogether these guys sitting up there own a total of less than 3% and where does Mr. Cromwell put his million dollar salary? Certainly not in Teldar stock, he owns less than 1%. You own Teldar Paper, the stockholders, and you are being royally screwed over by these bureaucrats with their steak lunches, golf and hunting trips, corporate jets, and golden parachutes! Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents each earning over $200,000 a year. I spent two months analyzing what these guys did and I still can't figure it out.    Cromwell is pissed.   One thing I do know is this paper company lost $110 million last year, and I'd bet half of that is in the paperwork going back and forth between all the vice presidents... (increased laughter, he's getting them The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be 'survival of the unfittest'. Well in my book, you either do it right or you get eliminated. Teldar Paper is doomed to fail. Its diversification into casualty insurance has not worked. Its crown jewels are its trees, the rest is dross. Through wars, depressions, inflations and deterioration of paper money, trees have always kept their value, but Teldar is chopping them all down. Forests are perishable, forest rights are as important as human rights to this planet, and all the illusory Maginot lines, scorched earth tactics, proxy fights, poison pills, etc. that Mr. Cromwell is going to come up with to prevent people like me from buying Teldar Paper are doomed to fail because the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, as you very well know, is the only way to stay strong is to create value, that's why you buy stock, to have it go up. If there's any other reason, I've never hear it.  That's all I'm saying...it's you people who own this company, not them, they work for you and they've done a lousy job of it. Get rid of them fast, before you all get sick and die. I may be an opportunist, but if these clowns did a better job, I'd be out of work. In the last seven deals I've been in, there were 2.3 million stockholders that actually made a pretax profit of $12 billion. When I bought the Ixtlan Corporation it was in the exact same position Teldar is today -- I turned three of its companies private and I sold four others -- and each of these companies, liberated from the suffering conglomerate has prospered. I am not a destroyer of companies, I am a liberator of them. The point is, ladies and gentlemen, greed is good. Greed works, greed is right. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed in all its forms, greed for life, money, love, knowledge, has marked the upward surge of mankind -- and greed, mark my words -- will save not only Teldar Paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA...Thank you.  Much applause as he sits. Now a standing ovation; shouts of approval. Cromwell knows he has lost the day, tries to continue the meeting by calling for \"order\".  Bud watches, impressed.    A salon interior. Gekko on a couch reading, with eyeglasses, a stack of financial reports. Alex is on the phone, Susan, and others accompanying the caravan on a business trip. Bud is excited.   Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...   Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...    I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.    What does that mean?   What makes you think you can?    Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen... (smiles wickedly, back to Bud So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...   A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.  Carl stares at Gekko, sizing him up.   I'd be proud to have a son like Bud. He's got a great future ahead of him.  Carl looks to his fellow union representatives, then to Gekko.    Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?   Look, I have no illusions about winning a popularity contest with any of you. I was roasted the other night, and a friend of mine asked-- why are we honoring this man--have we run out of human beings?  His joke breaks the ice; they laugh, except for Carl.   It's not always the most popular guy who gets the job done. You got losses of 20 to 30 million dollars, dividends cut to zero, you're getting squeezed to death by the majors. Present management may not be the worst scum of the earth, but they're the ones who've put you on a kamikaze course, and pretty soon everybody's going to be scrambling for the parachutes. Only there aren't enough to go around. Management has them. You don't. If they throw Bluestar into Chapter 11--which I think they will--then they can use bankruptcy laws to break your unions and your contracts and throw you guys off the property.  We hear a loud crunching sound as Bud's father bites into a roll, glaring at Gekko.   Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.  Carl drops his fork on the plate. Gekko goes on.   And seven more hours a month.  Toni Carpenter and Duncan Wilmore exchange questionable looks.   Give me a year. If we're still losing money, the reductions stand. If however, we move into the black, I return part of the givebacks, salaries go back to present levels, and...  we institute an employee profit sharing program with stock. You'll own part of the airline.  Carpenter and Wilmore react with surprise, it's obvious they weren't expecting the profit sharing part. Bud smiles at Darien and looks to his father, who examines a sushi roll before putting it back.   I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.   Why don't I give Bud an opportunity to answer that.  Darien and Carl turn to Bud, who puts down his wine glass.    Cards are on the table. What do you think?   Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.    I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?    Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.  Carl throws down his napkin, rises from the chair, looks at the others.   Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.    Bud walks intently past the receptionist and down the long white marble hall.    Gekko is talking with the LAWYERS and BANKERS from the Bluestar deal, as Bud barges in.    I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.   Will you gentlemen excuse us for a few minutes?  The lawyers and bankers get up and discreetly leave the room. Gekko waits for them to go, turns back to Bud.   What the hell do you want?   Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.   You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.   Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.    It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.   Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.   The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...   Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...   Are you with me Buddy?  At the door, a look of unmistakable power...and danger.   I want you with me.      ...be another minute, Natalie.  As he crosses back to the coffee table and punches up a phone number.   This is Gordon Gekko. Now... (a beat, with controlled rage I want zip-locked mouths on Bluestar, or I'm gonna personally come down there and rip out your fucking throats!    Bud walks out, heading up the street, absent amid the scurrying mid-day hordes tearing up the street for the loot inside.   Look over there sunshine. I'm up against Richard Feigen.  He is on a roll, electric. As the price mounts and surpasses the two million dollar mark, Gekko rises and walks down the side aisle to the front, never taking his eyes away from the auctioneer. He stands agressively, arms akimbo, in a nose to nose confrontation.   What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.   (condescendingly but paying little attention to the rebuff Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.  He pats her on the back in a preprietary fashion.    So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?    Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.    You told him about us?    Now tell me, why would I want to do that?   Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?   Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.   You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.   Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.  Darien's eyes cloud over...the look of a scared child being banished by her father. Then...    He paces on the other end of the phone, real anger showing; now Alex and Susan seen in b.g.   The word's out. Your union buddies are talking. Get me in at a 45 degree angle and I mean all the way in! Slash and burn, buy everything you can get up to 22. Then call me. When I get the sonofabitch who leaked this I'm gonna kill him! I'm gonna tear his eyeballs out, I'm gonna suck his skull!!  As he glances at his quotron the stock ticks up another 1/8th.    Gekko looks up from his quotron and shouts to his troops on the phones.   Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.   What the hell do they want?   You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.   I'd like to remind you we already have an agreement, which I expect you to honor.   Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!    Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.    Alex, Ollie, Susan on the phones.    Yeah, Harold, why don't you dial 911.  Fox, where the hell are you? I'm losing millions.  Look, you got me into this airline, and you damn well better get me out. Because if you don't the only job you're going to get on the Street is sweeping it! You hear me, Fox--    Dump it.  Bud hangs up and rushes off with the ticket.    The 35\" television is on to:   Hello Bud.   You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?  Bud looks away. Gekko's smile fades.   Well let me cue you in: the ice is melting under your feet sport...  Without warning, he grabs Buddy roughly by the lapels and lets out his inner rage with a series of smacks and slaps across his face.   You think you could've gotten this far this fast with anybody else? You think you could be out there dicking somebody like Darien? No, you'd be cold calling dentists and widows to buy twenty shares of some dog stock! I took you in! A nobody! I opened doors for you!...I showed you how the system works!...  Gekko slapping him harder and harder, Buddy staggering with the blows, saying nothing, not defending himself.   ...the value of information! How you get it! Anacott Steel, Brant Resources, Transuniversal, Fulham Oil. And this is how you pay back, you cockroach! I gave you Darien, I gave you your manhood. I gave you everything.  He backhands Bud across the face. Bud lies on the ground, spent, as is Gordon breathing hard. Bud gets to his knees, blood streaming from his nose, his suit muddied. Passersby look on, wondering.  Gekko seems to relent, the rage going into hurt, remorse. He hands Bud a handkerchief. Bud staunches the flow of blood from his nose.    You could've been one of the great ones Bud...I look at you and see myself...Why?  Bud looks at Gordon, torn by mixed emotions: the bonds they share and the betrayal wrought.",
