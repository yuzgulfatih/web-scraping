The vines retract, freeing her. She rubs where they gripped her.  It has just begun. Have you forgotten your place in this?  I still believe in you. Close your eyes and see your tomorrow. She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. A single tear runs along her cheek. She opens her eyes.  You you already involved. Such is fate. We cannot hide from the .trials of our future... no matter how dark the alleyway. She looks back at the Basilica with profound sadness.  Am I to understand you do not intend to make this union with the Queen Andromeda?  Despite my will and intention that you do so?  Would you choose to condemn Men, your own people, to suffer more of this devastating War?     Does that absolve you suddenly of your responsibilities?  What will you do, Man of free will? Perseus motions Pegasus forward, and swings up onto his back.  So... my Son, you will be a pawn for love?",

        "Andromeda": "The BOY is AGENOR, a kitchen helper -- ripped and sexy. It's hard to tell who's the aggressor here. Gasping, Andromeda holds him at bay -- 23.  Do you think you can manhandle a Princess this way?  As though she was hungry and needy as you, a mere servant? Another steamy kiss. In between liplocks, she whispers  very mistaken... a woman of my station... never be attracted... They go at it again.   The Princess is not here. Find another... Princess.  I don't care!  To please you, I would submit to such a marriage... except I would rather die; Please let me know you're serious about this perverse plan so I can make arrangements to kill myself. 25.  Will you please give me some  What did you say?  Do you think just anyone can make intimate judgements on the royal family?  Do you always start a seduction with an insult? Perseus moves to the rail, very close to her, and looks at the sea.  What brings you here?  I mean here, tonight. He looks over at her a long moment.  It's not personal. You're not a bad-looking boy.  I'm too young. I don't want to be married.  Then why are you doing it?  Since we agree, it's settled. No marriage. 35.  That doesn't mean we can't be friends. Get to know each other. I want to show you something. She leads him into a tall, hedged garden maze.  I'll take care of you. They take two more jogs and find themselves in an odd sylvan chamber. Soft plants have been stacked in what could be mistaken for a bed.  This is my special place. No one can see or hear or even find us now.  Do you want to? When he turns back to her, she melts into his arms and gives him a long deep kiss. He's surprised, but handles it well. When she tries to continue, he slows things down, holding her at bay.  Do you not find me attractive?  Of course, you haven't been much in the world.  Don't you want to make love to your almost-wife? Maybe we'll find we're not compatible.  Is it true you're a demigod?  I don't see it.  But let's find out for sure... She kisses him yet again, pulling him toward the bed of foliage. He can no longer resist. Together they fall into the softness. He kisses her passionately as their bodies begin to move together. She breaks the kiss for only a moment, her voice husky --  I think I'm becoming a believer... They start to make love.  You're late.  I want to thank you for seeing me home. I was so flushed with wine I can't recall much of the evening. Perseus half smiles and turns to the crowd.  At what point do you plan to tell them we're not getting married?   Them...    -- your beloved, worthless Princessa. Andromeda GASPS. Shock everywhere. 42.     My father was ready to sacrifice me to the monster.  I saw it. I heard the words. My loving father, his beloved child. Only Perseus stayed his decision. And do you know the worst part, Peshet? He was right. Peshet's feline eyes widen. More LIGHTNING.  The city is besieged, the people suffer. 51.  Because of me, because he did not offer me up. Is that right?   Sleep? Sleep will come soon enough for me, faithful one. In one month... at the latest. The palace shakes with the ROLLING THUNDER.          I would speak with the King in private.  We can speak here, in the elements our subjects endure. The King's men exchange looks, then bow discreetly away, leaving father and daughter alone. Andromeda looks down at the tent city.  You've sheltered me too long from the hard things in this world.  And I thank you for the gift of my cosseted youth. But now, with Mother so...  It's time I shared this burden you've carried so long. Filled with emotion, he puts an arm around her.  No, no longer. Your protection of me has brought hardship to our people... 93.  and to me, perhaps, new understanding. I must ask you something, Father. She turns away from his gaze and looks down at the city.  If you could end this siege with just one unselfish act, would you do it?  Such an act is within my power. He studies her a moment, then becomes alarmed.  Perseus and the others were willing to give everything.  Be at peace, Father, I will not cause you any more sadness than I already have.        Peshet, stop! I know what I am meant to do.  I was afraid, Peshet. Afraid to understand that the fate of so many could rest with me.   I'm not afraid anymore. I will do what I must. I will die so that they may live.     We must get to my mother and father. A VOICE from the darkness:  As she RISES: The cliff drops straight down the jagged wall to the churning waves.  The Kraken slips underwater and its vast shadow immediately begins to circle wide for another attempt.  Leviathan grows huge as it leaps for her. UP, UP, UP. The JAWS SNAP CLOSED... just below her climbing feet. So close, it BITES ON THE DROOPING SLACK OF CHAIN! The monster slides back down, clutching the chain in its jaws. The Princessa plummets with it.  I think I am. He smiles. She'll never know how close they came to oblivion.  Are you ready to become a king? His expression is kind, but unmistakable. \"No.\" She accepts that, rueful.  Yes. Yes, I am.",

Fear grips the crowd. An occurrence rare in the world of Men -- AN OLYMPIAN  Twenty-five years! How is that possible? Amoun winces at her tone. Thoth sends a scary glance her way. Icy --     Is my only daughter to marry a demigod, not of this earth?     What assurance do we have that our daughter will be safe?  The Gods have a caste system just as men do. The Olympians are our nobility -- few but cosmic. The Chthonians are the peasants. Our abode is this earth, and we exist as long as men worship us.  Peshet! Startled, Peshet spins to see the Queen approach. 24.  Where is the Princess?  She is not. You are expected to know her -- A SQUEAL and WHISPERING from the closet stops Cassiopeia. She throws a perturbed glance at the door. Peshet looks guilty.     She'll be a great ruler one day.           The wedding comes later. Tomorrow we will have the public announcement.  She is unmistakable.  I won't be long-winded. You all know I am a modest person, no matter my rank. Some of the crowd react silently. Andromeda watches her mother with trepidation, but not as much as Kepheus, watching from his throne.     This union represents new hope for a lasting peace! That is the only cause for celebration. The crowd reacts with exclamations and applause. Amoun wills her to stop. Cassiopeia takes another drink, looks over at the Princess. 40.     To my beautiful daughter... more beautiful than all the women of Joppa. More beautiful than the Gardens of Nineveh... Kepheus is about to pull her away. She throws him a spiteful glance.  More beautiful than the turquoise ocean and its sublime Goddess of the Deep... Tiamat herself! My daughter is a beauty even a Goddess must envy. Amoun reacts in dismay. A distressed MURMUR roils the crowd. Andromeda goes to her mother.  I've gone on too long -- She stops with a look of sudden dread. The Great Hall DARKENS. The torch flames TURN BLACK. The temperature drops. The statues lining the hall shut their eyes and the doors burst open. TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, floats forward, parting the terrified celebrants. Perseus sees his first Olympian. Tiamat arrives at the dais. Cassiopeia drops to her knees.  Twenty-nine.",
        "Perseus": "It's my fault he's gone.  So it's his fault. Not mine, not fate, not the Gods?   Now my history is I let my friend die in my arms. I made it back, why couldn't he?  To what purpose? I failed him.  You always say that my abilities are greater than other men's. But they were not enough to save him.  How is that greater than other men?     Now eat your dinner, which the Gods -- and your father -- have provided.     You... I saw you watching our boat at the cliff.  Can I be of service?  Right now?  It wouldn't take much persuading to get me to leave this village, but tonight is impossible. My family can't wake and find me gone. Where do you want me to go?  Come back in the morning and we can talk about it.  For what? Perseus doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry between her feet. Then a centipede, a scorpion. Then a swarm, racing toward him. He feels the first spider and looks down. The creatures climb his legs, biting. Weakening from the venom, he stumbles back into the table, loses his balance and falls.  The Wilting Girl standing placidly in the doorway watching him.  How long have I been out? 20.  I had a dream. I fell into a dark pit. I thought I would never stop falling. But a beam of light formed a soft net, caught me and tossed me back. TheWilting Girl watches him.  When I came back up to the world, a beautiful woman appeared and spoke to me. But as she spoke she would sometimes disappear into the whiteness with a strange sound.  The Wilting Girl listens to his story.  When I could hear her, she spoke nonsense. She said that my father was a God and my mother a -- At that moment the blinding-white sail swings between them as she tacks, obscuring his view of her for a moment.

A good trick. You must be the demigod, not me.  A Chthonian?    And when none worship you? Sadness flickers through her extraordinary eyes.  And demigods, where do they stand in your hierarchy? 22.  If demigods rank so low, why do you need me?  What!  Who, me?  Forget it.  And just who exactly am I supposed to marry?  I don't think so.   That's what I'm doing.  The war has badly scarred this place.  Don't joke about such things. I'd be useless before such a huge responsibility.  What are they celebrating?  I'm not sure, Your Highness. I did not know my father.    She's not the only one, sir. I don't know much about the events for which I've been drafted.  If you are not kind and patient with her, if any harm of any kind should come her way, I will have your head on a stake. Kepheus thinks he sees a smirk on Perseus' face. He puts his hand on the hilt of his sword.  Not even a little, my lord. It's just that I myself was waylaid -- snatched also, as you say, from my happy springtime... Kepheus studies him to see if he's making jest of him.  I've been told I'm to play a part in events which serve a higher purpose... of which I'm not at all convinced.  With all respect, I have never seen a God. On my island, they're no more than a story.  I can only proceed based on what I have experienced, not on a faith I do not possess.  Perhaps from my adopted father, sir. I admire him greatly, and he believes in little he cannot hold in his hand.  No, Your Highness, a fisherman.  Master Amoun! He hurries over to the older man, who embraces him warmly. 30.  What are you doing here?  From my village tutor to Magi Strategos... What a path! The King's patience is exhausted. To Cassiopeia     How will I know her?  I'm a stranger here. Any hints?  Very beautiful. Andromeda spins, petulant.  I said, 'Very beautiful.'  I meant the sunset. She regards Perseus over her glistening bare shoulder.  I know nothing of seduction. I'm a simple fisherman. My home is across that water. 34.  To Joppa? I was kidnapped.  I've come to see my future wife. Startled, Andromeda suddenly realizes who he is. A mad mix of emotions crosses her face.  Me either.  No one asked me. And now that I've met you, I don't know if I can go through with it.  It's not personal. Seeing you makes it real. I think a man should make his own decisions. I won't be the pawn of a King or a God. She looks at him with new interest.  I don't think it's going to be that simple. Ignoring that, she takes his arm, moving even closer.  I'm already lost.

What? No, Master Amoun. I'm listening.  I'm a newcomer here. I would not presume to tell these men -- 45.  I know that I am young and have not seen much of the world, but it seems to me that nothing is indestructible. The Ministers react to the young man's arrogance.  Father, how did you find me?  He will help me destroy Leviathan. Spyros does a double-take, then swallows: \"Yeah, okay, sure.\" 46.  We have thirty days to find its weakness.   We'll leave tonight.  (uncertain, glances  Andromeda, up in the balcony, has made herself visible only to him. She silently mouths these words -- \"Thank... you.\"  Why do we bring the Earth Goddess into this danger?  Amoun, it seems an odd coincidence you came into my life as tutor, so long ago, and now, once again you instruct me.  I'm afraid I've dragged you into real danger, Father, when I have little idea of what I'm doing.  What's our attitude about destroying Leviathan?  Joppa is pummelled by the Dark Goddess.  By what name may mortals call you?  Who do your worshippers pray to?  Perhaps that is why they are falling in number? 52.  I have to call you something... Since we're naming you on this road, what about 'Via Dahlia'? She gives him a sharp look. Is he mocking her? He's defensive.  That's a pretty name. Wait, better yet -- 'Vidalia'? How's that... 'Vidalia'? That's more than pretty, beautiful really, just as you are. She is pleased, self-conscious, concentrating on the road ahead.  You don't like it?  What's that? I missed it --    Now is when an honorable man would turn around and walk away... . but they say I am not really a man. Vidalia surfaces and drifts on her back, looking sadly into the sky. Perseus fixates on the sadness in her eyes. His expression changes, and the tenor of this stolen vigil is altered. RAINDROPS fall as the SKY OPENS and a CLOUDBURST pelts the pool. Vidalia opens her lips to taste the rain and smiles. LIGHTNING. 54.  Vidalia...     I'm not the leader, Draco, Amoun is. I'm too young to start avoiding trouble. Perseus jumps up and approaches a roan Pegasus, speaking soothingly. It WHINNIES and threshes its wings, buffeting Perseus with gusts. The Pegasus rears up, and leaps over Perseus' head. It lands behind him, bucks its hind legs, and kicks Perseus face-first into the dirt. Icos and Boreas are laughing, but when Draco gives them a dark look, Boreas jumps up, sobered, and heads into the clearing.  I didn't beckon the Humbaba.  The monster killed my friend. I could not contain my rage. But you, Goddess, are aloof from the emotions of Men. Vidalia's eyes narrow, enraged.  Master Amoun... You knew about me, didn't you? When you came to our village?  You chose a poor student. I have learned little and my mistakes cost dearly.  It won't do Boreas any good.  I'm no demigod, Tutor. I'm not even much of a human.  I do not believe my fate is to be half a God. No demigod could feel as confused as I do tonight.  Tell me of the Cleon Desert Legion.  Djinn Raiders?  I won't do anything rash. I've learned my lesson.  No... Perseus. to life as                                                 -- leather sack of sand.  Only humans... He looks over the Lotophagi and sees Vidalia out there, alone, flinging sling-bullets as she fights her way toward the barrier.  Drop the barrier!                                          r  Drop it, Amoun! At that moment, Kalibos grabs Vidalia and drags her to the top of an outcrop. At the top, he turns, LOOKS DIRECTLY AT PERSEUS and HOWLS, his message clear: \"If you want to save her, come and get her.\" He hungrily rips her leather bandeau. Perseus turns to Amoun. 69.  Take the barrier down or I'll go through it!  I've learned one thing for certain! Perseus shouts at Thad, the massive Praetorian.  Get down! Perseus backs away three steps. To the others               --  Get ready to defend yourselves! Perseus runs, plants a foot on Thad's back and leaps out through the swarm, which immediately dissipates around the humans. They have only a moment to react as the stunned Lotophagi come to their senses.  Vidalia... we need to help them... He blacks out. Vidalia cranes to look over the edge of the cliff where Kalibos fell. She is mystified by what  Where... Where are we? The  But I thought the Djinn...  Why does this Djinn priest stay with us? 73.  Me? I don't understand.  I thought they didn't speak.  Tell me of them.  You made only one eye? 74.  Spyros, he means me no harm. The Shaikh lowers his hand: Spyros falls into the dirt. The Shaikh pulls his veil over his face. He kneels before Perseus, head bowed.  I hear you and I understand you. But I don't know how.  You are praying to me? There must be a mistake. The Shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has a zig-zag, LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN engraved on the blade, honoring Zeus.  An offering'? I thank you and take it humbly, as agift from a friend, not an offering. He takes the weapon and bows his head, surprising the Shaikh.  You honor my father? You honor Spyros?  Tell us what we want to know or your Eye has seen its last. 77.  Since you cannot see, let me tell you what's about to happen. I'm about to throw this evil Eye to the rocks far below. I fear its journey will be a taxing one. The members of the Expedition are impressed; Vidalia, too: the young demigod shows growing leadership. The Strix are panicked --  You don't have to tell us the secret. But you will have to live as blind as she made you.  Tell me first. If I like the answer, you get your Eye. 78.  I believe them.  Here's your second sight. Verdandi launches and catches it in her beak, pops it in her socket.   And Medusa! Where does she abide?  How can she be slain? 79.     Tell of the Gorgoneion. 81.           I wish it, but I can't perceive the world that way.  Nothing I have done has convinced me of that.  I'm beginning to hear the wind. (senses something,  Wait... She is already climbing the ladder. She stops for only a  What?  What do you see?  From me?  Then where? Spyros smiles, puts his huge, calloused hand on Perseus' shoulder. 86.  When does it go away?  I'm going into the Temple. 87.    Of what?  Yes. You?  (from across the  Where?  -- Joppa.   Tiamat chooses the city of Zeus to take hostage. (as Amoun confirms  Father, we've seen much on this journey we cannot hold in our hands. Yet these things are real enough. At each turn, we find monsters and Gods.  As you always said, they're petty, vengeful... and dangerous.  No. Men must be accountable to themselves. Otherwise we serve poor masters.  We must keep moving. Time is running out.  Vidalia! Perseus slides from his horse and follows her. Mongke says something to Tamburlane; they LAUGH. Amoun to  Who were they?  I was mad with fear. I was no hero. I just didn't want to die. Perseus turns toward the altar.  What is this? A marble tablet sits on the altar, its surface defaced. Vidalia runs her fingers along the scoring.  How long do you have?  What will happen?  What about me?  I don't believe that. Will love not buy another day, Vidalia?  When you vanish, I'll find you.  I'd rather look at you.  Don't give away your secrets. You still have need of them.  In QUICK FLASHES: A white lid opens to a black eye. Reflected in the eye -- clouds roll over a stormy sky.  Where is she?  It is not yours to permit, Master... with respect. Vidalia comes down into the shrine, her apron full of berries.  I won't marry Andromeda. 101.  I want no reward.   I am half God... and now is the time... Perseus rises. He cocks his arm and clobbers Set with an ear-splitting CRACK OF THUNDER and a sparking BURST OF WHITE ENERGY. Set drops Vidalia and lurches back, aghast. BLACK BLOOD shoots from his mouth. Perseus, his face contorted in rage, chokes Set. The God's body SPASMS and deforms in DEATH THROES. 102.  We must go quickly now. He pulls the sickle from the marble with a BRINNG! The light flashes off Zeus' LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN on the blade.  The combat has just begun.  You'll have to tell them yourself. Vidalia's voice has become weaker.  I will not fail them. He turns toward the Goddess, but Vidalia is gone.  Vidalia? (realizing,  I must get to the cliffs!  A white lid opens to a black eye... Feathered WINGS beat the air... The rippled flanks of a WHITE CREATURE.  May we all have a good ride today! He spurs Pegasus. it beats its wings, launching from the ridge with astounding power.  Exactly the image he saw when Vidalia first planted the spell in his mind -- down, down toward the dark sea.  Hello. (as she smiles,  Are you ready to become a queen? 115.  Then you're ready to go home. Perseus raises one arm. The-AIR reverberates to a LOUD BEATING OF WINGS. Andromeda looks up in wonder. Pegasus appears out of the sun's glare, gracefully alighting on the water. Perseus helps Andromeda up and then climbs on behind her. Pegasus takes off. TILT UP WITH them until they are lost from sight.  Perseus views the scene from a nearby hill. Behind him, Pegasus waits patiently, grazing the grass. Until -- 116.  Yes.  Yes.  I have no people. You have stranded me between realms, neither man nor God.  No. I thank you... Father. Zeus, mighty God, reacts to the word. His expression softens and he looks on Perseus with growing pride.  You have freed me. I will not be a pawn for Men or Gods.  You've made me understand that my responsibility is to myself. So it is with us all. 117.     It matters not. Whatever the source, I are only grateful. He looks off toward the funeral pyres and the human throng.  This war will end the moment you choose for it to end... and Men agree. I think, perhaps, that is the free will that all realms share. Zeus looks at him, proud, yet wistful -- what an offspring, what a creation!  I'm going to find Vidalia.",
        "Draco": "More. The Mongols stare -- either not comprehending or ready to fight.  It must last all night. Get some more. 53.  Pegassi, stallions of the Gods.  Stop it, rogues. One of our own has disappeared without a trace and all you can think is to cause mischief. What if Perseus is bucked to his death from a thousand feet up? 56.  Don't do this. If we go back to camp right now, we can avoid trouble and keep our goal in sight. A true leader will not be distracted.  Perseus, get out of there! Icos, fetch the others. Icos bolts. Draco and Boreas leap into the clearing with swords drawn to draw the monster's attention. Perseus does the same.  I told you to run, boy. You'll make things worse. 57.  Boreas! Draco hacks at the monster's leg, to no avail. it rips off Boreas' head and swallows his body. Perseus CRIES OUT and leaps at the creature, sword swinging.   Look sharp. Watch your surround.  Where is everyone? Spyros HEARS something and follows the SOUND to a tent, weapon ready.  Let's kill these freks! Perseus runs over the backs of the Lotophagi. Hurtling off them, he scrambles up and knocks Kalibos off Vidalia. Ralibos rolls, flips onto his feet and gives Perseus a look: \"You're the one that I want.\" They face off, looking for an opening. Perseus lunges, thrusting his sword. Kalibos dodges, springing up the rocks and then down toward Perseus, acrobatic as an ape. Perseus rolls out of the way. Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos' head. The monster catches the blade in his jaws and SNAPS IT IN TWO! Bloody spittle flies from his tongue. Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus. He opens his jaw and sinks his teeth into Perseus' shoulder. Vidalia cracks a rock into Kalibos' head. The creature whirls on Vidalia and careens toward her, head bloody. Perseus leaps in the air and catches Kalibos in the back with both feet, knocking him over the edge. 70.  The Skolothians have suffered more than their share in this war. The Legions of the Gods have battered them.  Don't go in there, Perseus. It's a trap.  Tell the story, sir. My men fear only one thing -- to let fear in their hearts. Mongke says something that means, \"Go ahead already.\"  I am with you.  Are you afraid?  Good boy.     I hear her, Perseus. She's near! Her torso behind him, she RATTLES her tail in front. Draco spins and slices the air. The RATTLE stops. Draco waits, confused. 89.",
