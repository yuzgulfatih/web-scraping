        "Clawhauser": "O-M goodness! They really did hire a bunny. What?!  I gotta tell ya, you are even cuter than I thought you'd be.    Oh, there you went, you little dickens!  Oh! Bullpen's over there to the left.    Okay, you're gonna have to be patient and wait in line just like everyone else, Mrs. Otterton, okay?  Chief, uh, Mrs. Otterton's here to see you again.  Okay, I just didn't know if you wanted to take it this time, she seems really upset--  I'm sorry, sir, I tried to stop her, she is super slippery. I gotta go sit down.  Here ya go! One missing otter!  Yikes! That is the smallest case file I've ever seen! Leads: none, witnesses: none-- and you're not in the computer system yet, so resources: none. I hope you didn't stake your career on cracking this one.  The murder weapon!  Yeah, `cause that... What does that mean?  Are you familiar with Gazelle? Greatest singer of our lifetime-- angel with horns-- okay, hold on, keep watching. Who's that beside her? Who is it?     (finally notices ringing  Blue Rev.                   62.  Okay, we're sending back up! Hopps?  Chief Bogo!  Wait, is that Gazelle?  You have the app too?! Oh, jeeeeez!  Oh, yes of course! About that, sir... Officer Hopps just called... She found all of `em.  Um, they thought it would be better if a predator such as myself wasn't the first face you that you see when you walk into the ZPD.  They're gonna move me to Records. It's downstairs. By the boiler.",

        "Yax": "Oooooooooohmmmmmmmm. Oooooooooooohmmmmmm.  Ooo, you know, I'm gonna hit the pause button right there, `cause we're all good on Bunny Scout Cookies.   Huh? Oh for sure, we're a naturalist club.  Nangi's just on the other side of the pleasure pool.  Yeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird, but you know what I say is weird? Clothes on animals! Here we go.  As you can see, Nangi's an elephant, so she'll totally remember everything. Hey Nangi, these dudes have some questions about Emmitt the Otter.  Uh, Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to your yoga class for like 6 years?  He was here a couple Wednesdays ago. `Member?  Yeah, he was wearing a green cable- knit sweater vest, and new pair of corduroy slacks. Oh, and a paisley tie. Sweet Windsor knot. Real tight. Remember that Nangi?  Yeah, and we both walked him out and he got into this big ol' white car with a silver trim? Needed a tune up. The third cylinder wasn't firing. `Member that, Nangi?  Oh, for sure. It was 29THD03.  Told ya Nangi has a mind like a steel trap. I wish I had a memory like an elephant.",
        "Bellwether": "Oh! Yes right.  Congratulations, Officer Hopps.  Ya know, it's a... It's a real proud day for us little guys.  I just heard Officer Hopps is taking the case!    And I sent it, and it is done, so I did do that. All right, well I'd say the case is in good hands! Us little guys really need to stick together! Right?    Sir? If we could just review these very important-- Sir?  Ooo, I'm so sorry... sir?!  No, no! But, sir, you do have a meeting with Herds and Grazing... sir, if I could just--  Oh, mutton chops.   We're in Bellwether's cramped little office. Nick and Hopps hover over her while she sits at her computer.   Where to?  There! Traffic cams for the whole city. This is so exciting, actually. Well, you know, I never get to do anything this important.  Oh, I'm more of a glorified secretary. I think Mayor Lionheart just wanted the sheep vote... But he did give me that nice mug.  Feels good to be appreciated.  That's a fun little name he likes to use. I called him Lionfart once. He did not care for that, let me tell you. It was not a good day for me. Yes, sir?  Oh, dear. I better go -- Let me know what you find. It was really nice for me to be--  Officer Hopps, it's time.  Okay, thank you Officer Hopps, uh, that's all the time that we have. No more questions...  Oh, you did fine.   Hopps looks at the pamphlet. Bellwether sits across from her at her desk.   Our city is 90% prey, Judy. And right now they're just really scared. You're a hero to them. They trust you. And so that's why Chief Bogo and I want you to be the public face of the ZPD.  Judy, you've worked so hard to get here. It's what you've wanted since you were a kid. You can't quit...  Judy! Judy!    I'll go ahead and I'll take that case now.  Get them!  Come on out, Judy!  We're on the same team, Judy!  Underestimated. Under-appreciated. Aren't you sick of it? Predators. They may be strong and loud, but prey out-number predators 10 to one.  Think of it-- 90 percent of the population, united against a common enemy. We'll be unstoppable.    Well, you should have stayed on the carrot farm, huh? It really is too bad; I really did like you.  No! Of course not... he is.  Yes, police! There's a savage fox in the natural history museum. Officer Hopps is down! Please hurry!  Oh, but he can't help it, can he? Since preds are just biologically predisposed to be savages.  Gosh, think of the headline: \"Hero Cop Killed By Savage Fox...\"  Yeah, pretty much.  Fear always works. And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way.  Bye-Bye, Bunny.  What?  I framed Lionheart, I can frame you too! It's my word against yours!  And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way...",
        "Flash": "Nice to... see you... too.  I am... doing... just...  ...as well... as... I can... be. What...  ...can I... do...  For you...  ...today.  Sure.    What's the... plate...  ...Number?       0.  Sure.  I don't... know... What... do... you call... a...  Three humped... camel?  Ha... ha... ha... ha...  Hey... Priscilla...  What... do...  You call... a...  Three... humped...  Here...  You... go.   Manchas is driving when he's attacked from the back seat.",
        "Gazelle": "I am Gazelle. Welcome to Zootopia!  Wow, you are one hot dancer...  Wow, you are one hot dancer...  I am Gazelle, and you are one hot dancer.  Wow! I'm impressed.  Zootopia is a unique place. It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city where we celebrate our differences. This is not the Zootopia I know.  The Zootopia I know is better than this.  We don't just blindly assign blame. We don't know why these attacks keep happening...  ...but it is irresponsible to label all predators as savages.  We cannot let fear divide us. Please-- give me back the Zootopia I love..."
