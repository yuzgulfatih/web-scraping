        "Sex": "Anything you gotta say to them, say to me first.  Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He effortlessly knocks them away.  They both hit the ground.  Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to \"come ahead.\"  Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway locomotive.  Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio, who HITS the floor.  Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp, BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the savage beating.   That's enough.  Jacob and Seth stop.  Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead vamp.  Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from around his mouth.  Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his trouble. Chet dives at Kate.   He ain't your brother no more.   No, it's more of a gnawing sound. Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats gnaw.  Seth puts the bottle in his hand down.   Watch out, girly!  The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a scream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine, Big Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue. As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out of Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's heart. He dies and bursts into flames.  At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.    Goddamn fuckin' vampires.  The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire Hunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their feet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into flames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap, SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for a loop.  As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS on his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a stack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the vamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames, which hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.   Fire!  Frost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.   Way ahead of ya.  What's your name, girly?   Sex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha. Kate, let's stake these blood-sucker fuckers.  Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to work STAKING the dead bodies.  Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and whatever else is at hand.  A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered over. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands in front of the window.   He's right. Peter Cushing does that all the time.   Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I forget, does silver do anything to a vampire?   I know silver bullets are werewolves. But I'm pretty sure silver has some sort of effect on vampires.   Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our barricades, that door, those plastered windows and these walls will last two more hours with those bat fucks fuckin' with 'em.   You mean like a Time-Life book?  Everybody laughs.   Another thing, you try and ram a broken chair leg in a human, you better be one strong son-of-a-bitch. The human body is one rough-tough machine. But these vamps got soft bodies. The texture of their skin is softer, mushier. You can push shit right through 'em. Conceivably, if you hit one hard enough, you could take their fuckin' head off.   Stop fucking saying that!   That bite weren't nothin'. It just hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's all. It barely punched the skin.  Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are many voices, male, female, children saying:    What are you gonna do about it?  Frost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off, straight at Sex Machine.  Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and pulls it back, so he can really haul off.  Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him through the air.  Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:",

        "Jacob": "We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --   Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little overzealous, but give me a break, I just bought it.  Scott and Kate continue the impersonation.   Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?   You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.   I'm exhausted.   I just bet you would. Don't even thin about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest-to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.   That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.   Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?   I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.   Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.   Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.   There's nothing wrong with this place.   It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.   It has a bed. That's all I care about.   Watch where you're going!    Kate and Scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.   I have no idea.  Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to move. Not threatening, just looking at them.   Anytime, man.  The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one side to let them pass.  Pass they do!    What?  From the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.   I hope none of this is disturbing you.  Scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him, he smiles.  Jacob opens the door and sees...  ... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the nicest guy in the entire world.    Sure.  We follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.  He sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.   What is this?  Seth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.   Jacob.   He's my son.   Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.   What's this about, money?    It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.   On the dresser.   Look, if you want the motor home, just take it and get out.  Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male hostages.   Not a chance.   If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.   My children are not going with you, and that's that.   Yes.   Scott and Kate.  Seth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet.   My wife.   In heaven.   Yes, she is.   Auto wreck.   No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.   Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.   Yes, they do.  Seth looks back at the wallet. He sees Jacob's minister's license.   Yes.   Real McCoy.   I was a minister.   Yes.   I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.   Yes.   How do I know you'll keep your word?   You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.   Yes.   No, I didn't.   You won't let him touch her?   If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.   I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.   I'm telling you, don't hurt her.   I don't have the slightest idea.   I'm gonna try and get us across the border.     Have you forgotten about your sister?   If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.   What about Kate?   Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.   Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.   I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to \"go for it.\" I need your cover. Cover my ass.  There's a HONK behind them.  They both look out the window. It's their turn with the BORDER PATROL GUARDS. JACOB takes the wheel and drives up.  A stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window.   Just my son and I.   Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.   Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.   I meant me, my son and my daughter.   We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.   Then?   Guys! We're here.   Out of the stew pot and into the fire.   Now wait a minute, there's no reason to get ugly. There's just a misunderstanding going on here. You said this bar is for truckers and bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.  Everybody looks at Jacob.  As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.   If you look outside your door, parked in your parking lot, you'll see a big ass recreational vehicle. That's mine. In order to drive that legally, you need a class two driver's license. That is the same license that the DMV requires truck drivers to carry in order to drive a truck. (he takes the license out  of his wallet and lays it  on the bar That is me, and this is my class two license. This is a truck driver's bar, I am a truck driver, and these are my friends.  Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.  Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at everyone in the party and smiles.   Pass.    No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.   No you won't.  Seth pours Scott a shot.   Why are you so agitated?   He backed down.   What are you going to do?   Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.   Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?  Richard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can believe what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays down his drinking glass.   Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.  Seth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.   To yours.  They both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.   Now, is your shit together?    Oh, shit.  Seth --  Seth waves him away.   Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!  Seth aims his gun at the group.   Then why didn't I?  Jacob walks over to Seth.   I saved your life. I didn't have to, but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're gonna get out of this we need each other. And we need you sober and thinking, not drunk and...  As Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has grown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to identify it.   What the hell is that?   Give me a hand!  Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other items to help secure and barricade the door.  As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and the windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops open his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious activity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's putting a board into place. He springs to his feet and POUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the room in her direction.   Is everybody okay?  Everyone mutters \"yeah.\"   Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?   I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.   In the Winnebago.   What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.   About two hours from now.   Has anybody here read a real book about vampires, or are we just remembering what a movie said? I mean a real book.   I take it the answer's no. Okay then, what do we know about these vampires?   Yeah, that bottle upside the head of Santanico didn't kill her, but it didn't feel too good either.   I've had enough of your taunts.  Seth looks up from the floor.   I'm a mean, mother fucking servant of God.  The laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing. It immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit they're in.   What are you talking about?   Good lord!  Frost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow and CRASHES through it.  Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the hand and runs for the backroom.  Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the ground.  Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott, who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams, howls and snaps in fury.  Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his .45 in its big mouth.   Open the door.  The door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS shut.  Jacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his bloody arm.  When he releases them, they can't help but notice.   Yep.  Seth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping over tables and cussing a blue streak.    You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.  Kate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.   No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.  Scott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for dear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the kids will never have the courage for what they must do.    Children, listen to me. I love you two more than anybody. And I just want you to know you've made me proud all your lives. But never more so than tonight. And I wish we could sit here and cry till I pass on, but we can't. Because I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to turn into a monster. And when I do, I'm going to be dangerous. But before that happens, just know I love you.  Now, I'd say in the next twenty or thirty minutes our friends outside will bust in this door. And I'll probably turn into a vampire within the hour. Now, you have two choices. You can wait for me to turn, then deal with me, then wait for them to burst inside here and the three of you will deal with them. Or, we can kick open that door and the four of us can hit 'em with everything we have, and carve a path right through 'em to front entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em, we gotta go at 'em now. I confused them, I scared them, I took them off guard. But they're going to get unconfused, they're going to get unscared, they're going to get together and they're going to hit that door like a ton of bricks. And when that moment arrives, we gotta be ready.  Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled with boxes and crates.   What's this stuff?   Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.   Amen.   Before we go any further, I need you three to promise me something. I'll fight with you to the bitter end, but when I turn into one of them, I won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a lap dog of Satan. I want you three to promise you'll take me down, no different from the rest.  The kids can't say the words.   Kate, Scott?   Scott?   Why don't I believe you?  I'm gonna ask you two again, then I want you to swear to God that you'll kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna just kill myself right now. Now, since you need me I think you better swear. Kate, do you swear to God that when I turn into one of the undead, you'll kill me?  Kate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his temple.   Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...   Not good enough, swear to God.   Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...   It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...   Thank you, son.    To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!  Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth off the ground.  Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room, he CRASHES into a table.  The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer sticking out of his chest, dead.  Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She screams:   No!",
        "Fuller": "The Fullers are in room #12. It's identical to the one that the Gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the beds are different. Jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes on the bed.  Scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged electric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.  KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear shit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up. POUND... POUND... POUND... on the door. Jacob SPRINGS UP. He looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.",
        "Santanico": "\"ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY\", and \"THE SLEAZY TITTY   The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening notes of the Coaster's \"Down in Mexico\" fills the room.  The crowd hushes up.  And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.  This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that Stendhal described in \"As the Promise of Happiness,\" but the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.  She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the stage, but like she owned the world.  And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the world is proud to be her possession.  All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and accompanies from the table with the guitar.  When the music builds to its explosive section.  Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the room.  She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.  As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.  Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.  Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard. She STANDS OVER him.  While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.  She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.    Drink up.  Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she surveys.  Jacob and Scott are embarrassed.  Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.  Seth laughs out loud a Mexican \"yi yi yiii\" laugh, keeping the beat with his guitar.  Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what Seth and company did to Chet.  Richard continues to suck her toes.  The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks down at the seated Richard.  She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds, none louder than Seth.    Muy bien, gracias.  Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.   Let's see if you taste as good as your brother.  She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.  Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the FLOOR and INTO the WALL.  A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.  Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the bar to the other.  The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE, goes head to head with a stripper.  The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the vamp bitch blow for blow.  Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her on the wooden leg.  FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie appears, straight razor in hand.  Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half. Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of the cue in Razor Charlie's heart.  Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the vampire's death scream.  Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block placed on his chest.   I'm not gonna drain you completely. You're gonna turn for me, You'll be my slave. You'll live for me. You'll eat bugs because I order it. Because I don't think you're worthy of human blood, you'll feed on the blood of stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool. And at my command, you'll lick the dog shit from my boot heel. Since you'll be my dog, your new name will be \"Spot\". Welcome to slavery.  SLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing  end over end.    looking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.  We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.  Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.  Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.  Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes the liquor-soaked robe ignite.  Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.  Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.",
        "Pandemonium": "\"ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY\", and \"THE SLEAZY TITTY   The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening notes of the Coaster's \"Down in Mexico\" fills the room.  The crowd hushes up.  And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.  This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that Stendhal described in \"As the Promise of Happiness,\" but the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.  She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the stage, but like she owned the world.  And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the world is proud to be her possession.  All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and accompanies from the table with the guitar.  When the music builds to its explosive section.  Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the room.  She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.  As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.  Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.  Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard. She STANDS OVER him.  While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.  She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.",
        "Richard": "The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't I just go in there, blow his head off and get outta here.    He signaled the Ranger.    When they were talkin', he mouthed the words \"Help Us.\"   Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face. And I saw him mouth:  Richard mouths the words, \"Help Us.\"  While Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls out a gun from it.  Seth releases his brother.   You believe me don't cha?    I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, \"Help us!\"    Yeah?   Gotcha!   What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.   Seth, I'm telling you, the way he looked at us -- you especially -- I knew he knew.   They both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth starts it op. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can hear Seth mumbling under the motor.   Do they have cable?   Do they have an X-rated channel?   Do they have a waterbed?    Seth turns from the door, sees the hostage woman standing.   How ya think, it hurts like a son-of-a-bitch.  Richie goes over to the bed and lies down on it. Seth takes the pillow and stacks them for Richie to prop his back up against.   Feels good.   Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.   Did you even to try to negotiate?   All I'm saying --   Wanna come up here on the bed and watch TV with me?   You can tell she doesn't want to.  He pats the empty space next to him.   Come on.  She gets out of her chair, walks across the bed, and sits next to him.     Richard lies on the bed by himself, propped up by pillows, watching TV, taking on hits from a water bong in the shape of a wizard.        Is it safe to assume since the law enforcement authorities in the great state of Texas are homosexuals of a sick and deviate nature, that they will be too busy fucking each other up the ass to actually catch The Gecko Brothers?  I would say that's a very safe assumption.  He changes a channel on the television. We see a Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon on the screen.   Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?   What'd ya see?   Didya look at the border?  Seth dumps the burgers on the bed. Both men pop open beers and Richard goes to town on a hamburger. Seth flips off the TV   They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.  Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.   Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.   How do you know?   What?  Seth's out of his chair.   She's in the other room.   Seth, before you open the door, let me explain what happened.  Seth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means. He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling. Then he BURSTS open the door.  The dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's obvious Richard raped her and killed her.  Seth covers his eyes with his hands. He slowly enters the room with the dead body.   Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me just explain what happened.  Seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him.  Richard backs up.    There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.   Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.   It's not your fault, it's her fault!  Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room, holding tightly to his wrist.   What?   Seth, if you were me --   Yes.   Yes, Seth, I understand.  Seth hugs his little brother. Tight.   Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is Don Cornelius. No, not the Don Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my lady friend need some ice and we don't seem to have an ice bucket. Could we possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it right back.   Sit down.  Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.   Good boy.  Jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.   Upsy daisy.  ...guiding him over to the bed by his father.  Richard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.   We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.     Sure.    What?   Mexico.   Mexicans.  He doesn't smile.  In the front part of the motor home, Jacob sits behind the wheel, driving into the night. Seth sits in the passenger seat, going through Jacob's wallet and talking to him calmly.   Did ya mean what you said back there?  Kate turns to him.   In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.    What you said to me in the room.    You asked me if I would --    What?  Seth and Jacob.    We'll talk later.  Kate still hasn't a clue what he means.   This isn't gonna work.   I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.    They're gonna search the van.   What does that mean?   You just called me a fuckin' nut.   Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.   You meant that, but you meant the other, too.  Kate can't believe what she's watching. Neither can Seth.    Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.    Or what?   I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?   Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.  SETH HAULS off and PUNCHES Richard smack in the head. Richard HITS the floor, Guard, Jacob, and Scott hear Richard fall in the bathroom.    Yeah, I think so. What happened?   I did?   Really?   Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.   What?   We are?   Far out.  Where are my glasses?   Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!   What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.   Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the-wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.   I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this. I been to some fucked up places in my time, but that place is fucked up.  Seth can't believe it.   That's what you think?   I'm lookin' scared?   You know what you look like?   You're lookin' green.  That's not what Seth expected to hear.   Where are you right now?   Where are you?   No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.   It don't look together.   Okay, just checkin'.  They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into the microphone.    Your shit is forever together!  They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second, and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,    Good job, Pops.  Seth's still frying an egg on his head.   Fuck 'em, shake it off.  Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks at the guy, still pissed.   Anytime you want a lap dance with that broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.  He gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange words about the party in Spanish.    Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you just created a monster.  Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.   Yeah.    Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?   Fuck off, ape man!  Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from his wounded shoulder.  Santanico steps back from the table.  Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor. Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake and SLASHES Seth across the face.  Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to his laid open cheek.  Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound, brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.  Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly before he hits the floor.  Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay out of gunfire.  The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what they were doing.  The music continues to play, though the dancers stop dancing.  Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells something.  Her NOSTRILS FLARE.  Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief and puts it to his face.   How are you?   Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!  Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He can't get a clear shot.  Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.  Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico rides him down to the floor.  Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.  Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about half way before he stops, saying:    Fucking Bitch!  He tumbles over, a corpse.   I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I love you, too.  Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away. He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.   Yeah, shut up.  Seth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake out of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.",

        "Razor": "You can't come in here.   This is a private club. You're not welcome.   This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!  Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.    Welcome to the Titty Twister. What can I get you?  Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.   Coming right up.  Razor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the party one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a buddy punch on the shoulder.   Best in Mexico.    They're not the normal road trash we normally feed on. But it'll be okay. No one knows they're here.  The five of them find a table and sit down.  Seth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.    And now for your viewing pleasure. The Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome of Evil. The most sinister woman to dance on the face of the earth. Lowly dogs, get on your knees, bow your heads and worship at the feet of   Which one?",

        "Kate": "We've got a Winnebago. We don't need those over priced roach havens. We're self contained.   -- you got your microwave --   -- you got your shower --   Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.    It's the bitterest of pills.   Ain't it the truth.   Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.   Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --   I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?    It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?   That happens, you'll get it back.   What do you think Mom would say?   I can't believe he's stopping here. This place looks totally cruddy.  Jacob walks out of the office. Kate yells from the motor home.   Dad, why are we stopping here?  He opens the meter home door and climbs in.   It's a flop house.   If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.  Starting the huge car and slowly maneuvering it through the courtyard.   Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...    Owww, my head.  Jacob  honks his horn at Seth and yells out the window.   Creepy guy.   What's going on?    She smiles at him.   Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?   Yes.   Yes.   Excuse me.  Richard zeros in on her.   Where are you taking us?   What's in Mexico?   Yeah.   Yeah, we got a bible.    EX CLOSE-UP KATE'S TOES. They wiggle.  His eyes go to her hands.      His eyes go to her neck.    EX CLOSE-UP KATE'S ADAM'S APPLE. She swallows.  His eyes move up.    Back to Richard.   What?   Do what?    What did I say?    We can only see Kate's face. It's scared. We hear rustling around the bathroom, but we don't know what it is.  Then it's quiet. Then we hear talking outside the door, but we can't make it out. Then we hear a knock.   I'm in the bathroom.   It's open.  We hear the door open and see the light change on Kate's face. She's looking up.  BORDER GUARD in the doorway looking in.  HE SEES: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting on the toilet.   Do you mind? Shut the fucking door.    You're gonna let us go?   Okay.  Seth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and knocks it back.    Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's transformation.  Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites of her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from her mouth. Kate yells from the floor.    Richie, look out!  Before Richie can turn around.  SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and SINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.  Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.  Seth turns to his brother's cry.  He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to a cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming about, trying to knock her off.  Richard screams to Seth:   Are you okay?   I'm really sorry.   Kate, what's yours?   Does anybody have any silver?   Then who cares?   So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.   I don't know if I can take two hours of that noise.   We have to go back for Daddy!   Noooo!  She spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door and help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up against the wall.   You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?   I promise.   Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!   I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.   Seth!  Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires on all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.    I'm going for 'em!   Everybody goes home!  Kate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing, one-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in Seth's direction.    Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die!  Kate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor, burning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a couple of water balloons and a stake.    Watch my back!   Oh my god.  Another bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite. Scott screams.   You bastards!  She goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.  Now seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood. Scott is in agony.   Not many.    Should I use the last bullets on us?   Me too.  Long pause.   Later.  Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate says behind him:   Seth.  Seth turns around.   You want some company?  Seth smiles.",
        "Scott": "Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?  Scott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something that Jacob has said about three hundred times.   We've got a Winnebago. We don't need those over priced roach havens. We're self contained.   Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --   -- you got your sink --   -- see this, television!    The truth hurts.   Why do you want to stop?   Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.  Jacob gives Scott a look that says, \"You aren't touching my new motor home.\"   I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.  Scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the restroom.  Jacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of silence before...   What's this guy's problem?   What are you gonna do?   No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.  Jacob is surprised to hear Scott say this.      They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.   Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.   They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.   If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.   Jacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him to him.   He's running the show.   It's clear.  Seth BURSTS out of the bathroom.   Okay, I'll have one.   Yeah, it's mine.    We got a problem!  Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its body through the newly formed hole.  Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45, point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.  The bat/rat sees this, makes an \"oh shit\" face, and YANKS his head back through the hole.  Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment, when...   What are you talking about? We got crosses all over the place. All you gotta do is put two sticks together and you got a cross.   That's werewolves.   When's sunrise?  Jacob looks at his watch.   You could take their head off.   He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.   He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.  Just then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.    Yeah, I promise.  Jacob doesn't believe them.   You don't believe in suicide.   Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.    Why did they block the door again?   I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's name.  He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead, creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire head bursts into flames, then explodes.  From across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She cries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:   Kill me, Kate!  Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three times.  One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.  The remaining vamps approach.  All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy balloon.",
        "Seth": "Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.   I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to \"Benny's World of Blood.\"  Richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl, leans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks at Pete.   Were you giving that pig signals?   He says you were scratching.   You callin' him a liar?  Pete controls himself.   Yeah, well, your best better get a helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot worse.  The toilet FLUSHES.   Everybody be cool.  Everybody goes back to what they were doing.  McGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware of the situation.    What the fuck was that about?   What the fuck is wrong with you --   Start the car.   Shut up and start the car.  Richard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter...  ...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in the hand.  Richard FALLS to his knees, howling.  Both Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire.  Seth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads.  Pete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads.  Richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle.  The two girls have run out screaming.     Richie? You okay?    Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!    When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!   One... Two... Three.   The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter.  They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete.  Pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol RAIN down on him.  Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf.  Richard keeps FIRING.  Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on fire with his Zippo, then tosses it.  The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air.  The fireball lands behind the counter.  The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete screams from behind the counter.  Seth smiles to himself and stands.  Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands.  Pete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES still holding his weapon and FIRING.  Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.  Pete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess Pastry display.  Seth and Richard rise from the rubble.     What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.   He didn't recognize shit.  Both Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.   Low profile. Do you know what the words \"low profile\" mean?    The Plymouth tears out of the parking lot backwards, hits the street, and speeds off down the road.  We CRANE UP HIGH to see the car leaving a trail of dust behind it, as the store burns out of control.   Whatcha think I want, ya mean old bastard? I wanna room.    No.   No.   They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.  Their car drives up to room #9, but they park backing up the trunk close to the door.  The two brothers get out of the car.    Open the door. We gotta do this fast.  Richie opens the door.  Seth goes to the trunk, looks around the court yard. It's empty.  CLOSE UP: KEY going into the trunk lock, turning.  TRUNK POV: Seth looking into the camera.  SETH'S POV: A WOMAN in her late forties is lying scrunched up in the trunk.  She is the HOSTAGE BANK TELLER from Abilene. She's stiff, scared and looks an absolute mess.   Don't say a word.  The two brothers, quick as lightening, yank the woman out of the trunk and whisk her into the motel room. SETH closes the trunk, looks around for any Johnny eye-witnesses, doesn't see any, slams the door.     Seth turns from the door, sees the hostage woman standing.   You. Plant yourself in that chair.  She sits down in the chair.   -- I said plant yourself. Plants don't talk. You wanna get on my good side? Just sit still and don't make a peep.  She shuts up.  Richard slowly takes off his jacket. He winces from his wound.   Let me help you.  He helps him get his jacket off.   How's it feel?   I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?   I'm gonna go get the money.  He heads for the door.    It's about five o'clock.  What time does it get dark around here?   Good. I'm going towards the border to check things out while it's still daylight. Call Carlos and arrange the rendezvous.   That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.   These guys ain't spic fire cracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word \"barter\". You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.   -- This conversation is over.  Richie shrugs and turns back to TV, Seth turns to the hostage, grabs a chair and slides it up in front of her.   Now, we need to have a talk. What's your name?   Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's my brother Richie. Let's cut to the chase. I'm gonna ask you a question and all I want is a yes or no answer. Do you want to live through this?   Good. Then let me explain the house rules. Follow the rules, we'll get along like a house on fire. Rule number one: No noise, no question. You make a noise...  ...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are you absolutely, positively clear about rule number one?   Rule number two: You do what we say, when we say it. If you don't, see rule number one.  Seth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's cheek. She squirms and shuts her eyes. He pulls back the hammer.   Rule number three: Don't you ever try and fuckin' run on us. 'Cause I got five little friends, and they all run faster 'n you can. Got it?  She nods her head yes.  He takes the gun away and replaces the hammer.   Open your eyes.  She does.   Gloria, you hang in there, follow the rules, and don't fuck with us, you'll get out of this alive. I give you my word. Okay?  She nods her head yes.  Seth rises.   I'll be back in a bit.  He exits.  Richard looks to the TV, then looks to Gloria sitting across the room in the chair.    Things are real hot here. Crossing's gonna be a bitch.  Don't worry, we'll get across. But when we do, where do we go?  Can we make it as close to the border as possible? Texas wants our balls. The quicker we're in your protection, the better I'll feel.  Okay, where?  The Titty Twister?  I love it already. Okay, Carlos, I'll see you and your men at the \"Titty Twister\" tomorrow morning.  Bye, my friend.  Seth hangs up the phone, lights up a cigarette with his Zippo lighter and exits frame. After Seth exits, leaving the frame empty, a subtitle appears:    Richard lies on the bed by himself, propped up by pillows, watching TV, taking on hits from a water bong in the shape of a wizard.     Sight seein'.   Cops.   Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?    I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.   Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.   I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --  Seth stops talking and looks around.   Where's the woman?   What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?   What the fuck is she doin' there?!  He goes to the door of the adjoining room.    Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?  Richard rises from the bed.   Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?   No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.    Is it me? Is it my fault?   Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?   This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?   Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.   Yes, Seth, I understand.    We get into Mexico, it's gonna be sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor, and rice and beans. None of this shit's gonna matter.     The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.    It's called a punch.  Scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's mouth.    What's your name?   Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.  Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.    Okay, move the Jap over there.  Keeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...    What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?   How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.   Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.   It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.  The door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad Kate walks in.  The brothers spin their guns in her direction.  Kate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun ready to spit.    Stop!  Jacob and Scott freeze.  Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.   Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid. (he turns to Jacob and Scott,  who are still standing You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!  They slowly sit.  Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.  Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both for their own reasons.    Where are the keys to the motor home?   Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.  Richard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate feels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him.  He looks in her face.   Richard!  Richard's eyes go to Seth.  Everybody is where they were. Kate never turned around.   Not when you get around to it, now.  Without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the room.    You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and put on some clothes.  She grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the bathroom.  Seth GRABS her wrist.   You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?   Do you believe me?   You damn well better. Go.  She goes into the bathroom.   Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that easy.  We hear the motor home \"HONK\" twice outside.   Get ready to move out, we're all going on a little ride.  Jacob shakes his head \"no.\"   Come again?   Sorry, I need everybody.    That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this. (he calms down and looks  at Scott Go sit over there.  Scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room, leaving the two men alone. Seth speaks in a quiet, conversational tone.   I ain't got time to fuck around with you, so I'll make this simple. Take your kids and get in the car, or I'll execute all three of you right now. (he cocks the gun and puts  it right in Jacob's face What's it gonna be, yes or no answer?  Jacob looks at him.   Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.  Seth BANGS on the bathroom door.   Times up, Princess.  The bathroom door opens. Kate stands there, wearing a T-shirt, jeans and bare feet.   Okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling.    Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?   Scott and Kate... Kate and Scott... Scott Fuller... Kate Fuller...  Seth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife.   Who's this?   Where is the little lady?   She's dead?   How'd she die?   Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?   Died instantly?   Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?   Is this real?   I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?   You're a preacher?   Was? As in not anymore?   Why'd ya quit?   I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit. Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?   I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.   Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.   Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?   Didn't like it, did ya?   Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.   I can handle Richie, don't worry.  The two men look at each other for some measure of trust. Seth sticks out his hand.   I give you my word.  Seth can't help but think about the last time he gave his word.    My words, my law. Better you not take it, and that's just where we are, then take it and not mean it.  Jacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.   Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!   You must have a bible in here, don't cha?   Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?  Kate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up front.   Hold it right there, sweetie pie.  Put your hand on it.  Jacob does.   Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.   You best better get it done, Pops.  Seth places his hand on the Bible.   I swear to God I'll let you loose in the morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I also swear if you do anything to fuck me up, I'll slit all your throats.   Richard!   I told you to watch those kids, I didn't say talk to 'em. You guys ain't got nothin' to say to one another. So cut the chatter.  Richard turns to Kate.   Okay everybody, it's show time. Richie, take Kate in the bathroom.  Richard grabs the terrified Kate and drags her in the bathroom,   Scott, you come up front with your daddy.  Scott does. Seth, keeping low, gets behind Jacob.   As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?   Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.  Seth disappears into the bathroom with Kate and Richard, closing the door behind him.  Father and son are alone for the first time since this whole thing began.   Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,   Duly noted. Now, shut up.  Everyone's quiet for a second, till Richard breaks it.    As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.    What?  Richard lets Kate go, she quickly moves to the side.   No, I didn't.   Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.    This ain't the time, Richard.    Keep your voice down.   This ain't the time.   Goddamn, that was. intense!  Seth goes to the back window. He sees the border getting farther and farther away. No cars following.    We did it.  We're in Mexico.  Seth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy.  Kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to Seth's scream, along with Scott.  Seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of the van.  Everybody else is still tense as shit. But Seth lets go of all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. He turns to Kate.    Come here, Kate!  Kate, nervous, takes a step back.  He charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist, and spins her around. When he lets her go, she stumbles dizzily onto the bed.    You were magnificent! You told him to shut the fucking door. I'm hiding in the shower, and I'm thinking to myself, \"Did I just fuckin' hear what I just fuckin' heard? And what does he do -- he shuts the fucking door!  Kate kind of half smiles.   If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd fuckin' marry you!  Seth goes up front and slaps Jacob on the back.   I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you raised a fuckin' woman.  Jacob doesn't share Seth's enthusiasm, but he is relieved.   Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.   In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, \"Digayo.\" When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called \"The Titty Twister.\" From what I hear, you can't miss it.   Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.  He slaps him once again on the back, and leaves to attend to Richard.    C'mon, kid, wake up. Don't make a  career out of it.  Richard starts coming to and opens his eyes. Seth sits at the foot of the bed.   You okay?   I don't know, you just passed out.   Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.   Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?   Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.   We are...  \"South of the border down Mexico way.\"   Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?  Slowly shaking the cobwebs out of his head.   They broke when you fell.   Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.   When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.   It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.  Jacob calls to the back.    Okay, troops, this is the homestretch. Here's the deal; this place closes at dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us here sometime before dawn. Which by my guesstimate is somewhere between three or four hours from now. So we're gonna go in there, take a seat, have a drink -- have a bunch of drinks, and wait for Carlos. That could be an hour, that could be three hours, I don't know which. But when he gets here, me and Richie are going to leave with him. After we split, you guys are officially out of this stewpot. Let me just say I'm real happy about where we're at. We got a real nice, \"I don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck with me\" attitude going on. Now, if everybody just keeps playin' it cool -- and I'm talking to you, too, Richie -- everybody's gonna get what they want. Comprende, amigos?  Everybody nods and mutters in agreement.   Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard. I'm buyin'.    Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.    Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little baby too afraid to go into the big scary bar?  The two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting, but like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real personal.   That's how you're lookin', Richie.   That's what you look like.   No, Richie, what do I look like?   How?   What do you mean?   I'm here with you.   My shit is together.   Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together.  Richard believes Seth's response.   Step aside, asshole.  Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.   Now, is my shit together, or is my shit together?  Richard and Seth laugh with each other.   Now this is my kinda place! I could become a regular.  The man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group as they approach.  Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who populate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing look across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies up to the bar.   Whiskey!   What dya mean?   Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?    Take your hand off me.   No, I'm going to count to three.   Two..  Jacob jumps in the middle.   Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.  Razor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth. But instead he just says,   That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest number one problem with Mexico, it's not service oriented. I was feelin' so good, and those fuckin' spies brought me down.  Richard puts his arm around Seth.   You serve food, Jose?  Razor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur, but he just smiles and says,   I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.  Seth walks away, and the group follows him.  We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor Charlie's head.  The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.  The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested, wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.  Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.   Who else?    Why not, against your religion?   Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?  Scott shakes his head no.    How 'bout you?  are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?   Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms up, boy.  Scott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an on-drinker's tremor.  Seth turns to Kate.   How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?   I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.   He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', \"Fuck you Jack.\" I hear that loud and clear.    I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.    I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.   What did you call me?   Jacob, I want you to have a drink with me. I insist.  Jacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.   To your family.   Forever together.  Seth turns to Scott.   In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.   Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.   Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what I call a fuckin' show!  One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe, which she puts on.  Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.    Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?   Well, then ask her, dumb ass.   Richie, you lucky bastard!  Now, little lady, you could of just as easily done that to me. Who a Nelly! You got my dick harder 'n Chinese arithmetic.  The table laughs.   Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red Riding Hood is walking through the forest and she comes across Little Bo Peep, and Little Bo Peep says: \"Little Red Riding Hood, are you crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf is walking these woods and if he finds you he's gonna pull down your dress and squeeze your titties?\" Then Little Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt and taps a .357 Magnum she has holstered on her thigh and says: \"No he won't.\"  As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.   Not now. So finally she comes across the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad Wolf's laughing and says: \"Little Red Riding Hood, you know better than to be walking around these woods alone. You know I'm just gonna have to pull down your dress and squeeze your titties.\" Then Little Red Riding Hood whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and says: \"No you won't. You're gonna eat me, just like the story says.\"  Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard, Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say anything --  The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.   Scarred for life, that's how I am!  Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.   You thought it was pretty funny, didn't you?  Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right... left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards the crowd.   Everybody be cool, or you'll be just as dead as these fucks!  SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.  SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.  The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.  SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls to the floor, splattering.  WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face could easily be read as intense sexual desire.   Richie.  Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet Pussy pop open. The \"dead\" men sit up with evil grins on their faces.  The patrons scream.  A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar and yells:   We may be in trouble.  Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.  Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off Seth and Jacob.  Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.  Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him look like a huge walking shark.  Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,   Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things up. You'd really like it in El Ray. We'd find peace there. I love you little brother, I'll miss ya bad.  Seth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.   Touch my brother with that stake, biker, and vampires won't need to suck your blood, they'll be able to lick it up off the floor.   That's a matter of opinion, and I don't give a fuck about your's.  Jacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to the ground.   Shut up!  Richard's giggling.   Hold him down.  The smile evaporates from Richard's face.   Richie, here's the peace in death I could never give you in life.  Seth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo. Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar. He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate, of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at the bar.   Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.   Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!   It's bats.    Get this bastard off of me!  Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.  Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo. Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.  Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a while, then...  BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.  Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with the bat-thing.  Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together, exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue to try and claw their way in.   Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about \"I don't believe in vampires\" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.  Everybody agrees.   You too, preacher?   Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?   In other words, no.   I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.   Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?   Aside from they're thirsty.   Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.  Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.   As far as God's concerned, we might just as well be a piece of fuckin' shit. But he's one of the boys. Only one problem, his faith ain't what it used to be.  Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor. Jacob stands over him.   I'm not taunting you. We need you. A faithless preacher doesn't mean shit to us. But a man who's a servant of God can grab a cross, shove it in these monsters' asses. A servant of God can bless the tap water and turn it into a weapon.  Seth rises.   I know why you lost your faith. How could true holiness exist if your wife can be taken away from you and your children? Now, I always said God can kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed my lifetime tune about thirty minutes ago' cause I know, without a doubt, what's out there trying to get in here is pure evil straight from hell. And if there is a hell, and those monsters are from it, there's got to be a heaven. Now which are you, a faithless preacher or a mean, mother fuckin' servant of God?  Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.   Oh shit!  Jacob sees.   You wanna suck something, suck on this!  He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over the wall.  Kate yells:   Daddy's dead.   He needs our help!   Did he...?   Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin' vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires! Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!  Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the creatures on the other side.   You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!   My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.   I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.   I promise.   Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some fuckin' vampires.    Kill 'em all!  Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.  The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire flesh.  The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk forward.  They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards the door.  Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in green vamp blood.  Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the other.  Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.  Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and toss them into the crowd.  They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming in pain.  From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and HURLS toward the group.  Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.  The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.  Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming the hammer stake into vampire chests.  The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other junk.   Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite and feel all right!  Kate clusters with her father and Scott.   Anytime.  Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the bar.  Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in fiery death.  Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.  As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts to hear the words: \"Thirst, thirst, thirst.\" He notices the vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow. His eyes are yellow.  Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.  Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.  Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and SMASHES it against Jacob's head.  The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.  Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it up to fire.  A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares with the boy he once called his son.  Scott's eyes turn to steel.   Fight now, cry later.  Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face with a holy water balloon, which melts his head.  A bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as it bites into him. He drops the .45.  Kate sees Scott get bit.   How many bullets left, kid?   Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.  The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.  The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands holding the .45, arm outstretched.   You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.  The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights on the face of an approaching vampire.  Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first vampire's head that gets in swinging distance.  Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched vamps scream like they've never screamed before.   Shoot more holes!  Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and Seth with a safe, lighted area.  The .45's empty.  The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being able to get at them.  The two survivors hold hands, when...  All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on from the outside.  The vamps look towards it in horror.  From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a Spanish accent.    Carlos!  Help us, bash the door. Bash the door in!   Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?   Have you ever been there before?   Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.  Carlos stands up again.   Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.  Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing themselves again.   You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.   Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.   They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.    Twenty-five.  Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over to a red 1990 Porsche 911.    I said new, this is an '90.   So do I just follow you?   So let's do it.   I'm sorry.   See ya.   Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But I'm not a fuckin' bastard.  He blows her a kiss across the desert.  She blows one back.  Seth's in his car and GONE.  Kate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and begins her long walk home.",
        "Frost": "Ain't they supposed to burn up or something?  At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating everyone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills the air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense light, which lasts only a split second.  It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies once lay.  They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.  Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.  He takes his dead hand.   At first I just thought it was birds.    We'll put this out. You stake the rest of these fuckers.   Wooden stakes in the heart been workin' pretty good so far.    John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once shot a man for snorin'.   Well, one thing, they might got super human strength, but you can hurt 'em.   You can. You'll take it 'cause ya got no choice. How'd ya like twenty four hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch with only the rotting corpses of your friends to keep you company?   Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole with my entire squad dead. They thought they killed everybody, and except for me, they were right. But it wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade blew up right next to me, that's why I'm so pretty.  They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me, listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after hour...  As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE say:   ...and then when I came back to my senses, I realized I had killed the entire V.C. squadron single handedly. My bayonet had blood and chunks of yellow flesh on it like some cannibal shish kabob. And to this day I don't have the slightest idea how I --  Sex Machine lets out a hideous cry.   I been bit! He fuckin' bit me!  Sex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a sack of potatoes.  He smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a table.  Sex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table leg. Frost looks at the big vamp.    You're dead, mother fucker! You're gonna bite me! You just turned me into a vampire, asshole!"
