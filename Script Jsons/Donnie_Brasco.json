Like the Army.  I said it's like the Army. Chain of command.  I mean the same principle.  Yeah. In California.  Which cocksucker?  of the Cadillac, running toward Lefty... INSIDE the cab, a nervous PASSENGER gathers her shopping bags...  Worry on his face. The Passenger FLEES down the block.  Left, c'mon. En ough.  Hey, fuck youl  What kind of bullshit is that?  You didn't wanna pay it you shouldn't've borrowed it.  Okay. I didn't know.  The vise grip or the needle nose?  I don't know, Left. This is the best car I ever had.  I never had any trouble with this car.    You think I got a fucking wire in my car?  What do you think--you think I ' m a fucking rat stoolpigeon?  He don't look so dangerous himself.  No thanks, Louise.  Jewels are my business. If I buy a fugazy, I lose. I hate to lose.                                                    .  Pretty good.    Peregrine falcons. They lived across the river.  In the Palisades,  I ' m saying that's why there's so many pigeons now. The falcons used to hunt 'em and kill 'em off.  I'm saying their eyesight.  What do you want/ two hundred?  You're the boss.  It's just an expression.  Hey, Left, if it's okay, I'm gonna run. I'll see you tomorrow.  This is way beyond what we talked about---\"fences and hijackers. T his is a made guy. Do you kno w what that means ? The re's only maybe 3000 made guys in the whole fucking country.  Can you believe it--a made guy? A very peculiar made guy.  Up here.  What's the matter?  Well, what do you want me to do now?  You could've said something.  That's not the point.  Maggie, I'll be two seconds.  You're going to the movies with the Grants?  The last thing I want to do tonight is go to the movies with the Grants.  Where is everybody? I didn't say anything? I'm sure I said something.  Well, they should be home anyway. What time is it?  Where's Terry?  What boyfriend?  That's what I ' m worried about.  I ' m sure he is. I ' m sure he's practicing his takedowns right now.    I give you whatever I can       give. What I can't give you is        a moustache. I don't have         a choice. I have to shave         the moustache.  Terry kisses and kisses...And kisses...Falls back onto the hood of the car and slides down it. Donnie senses that he's losing control of his family.  Left? Donn ie. I ' m ju st ch eckin g in.  That's what I said. I'm checking in.  I just woke up.  I just woke up, Left.  Where're we going?  What does that mean, you got sent for?  Sonny Red?  How do you know what he wants?  They should up you before they up Sonny Black.  I thought you and Sonny Black were friends.  I whacked a guy once.  In an argument.  I'm just saying.  It could be anything Sonny sent for you for.  He's hungry, Left,  At least you got Louise.  Yeah. I told you, in California.  You should give him a smack in the mouth once in a while.  What do you mean, cancer of the prick?  I never heard of that.  You know, Left, not for nothing, but six hours ago you thought you's gonna get whacked.  No.  I don't know 'cause you don't tel l me. How co me yo u didn 't tell me about that money you owe?  Maybe I could help you out.  I don't know.  I do?  You and me, Left.  I don't give a fuck, Left!...What the fuck do you want me to do?...I don't give a fuck what that mothe rfuck er sa ys--y ou believe him or me?  There hasn't been a divorce in my family back to Julius Caesar. Divorce someone else.  Maggie, I ' m tired. Go to sleep.  It's just another six months.  I ' m their father, Maggie.

This is my intimacy request.  That was a hundred dollars?  A hundred dollars. And how many of these do you think we'll need?  One hundred dollars.  I gotta work a ten hour day risking my life to make a hundred dollars!    Maggie--who told you to wear a seat belt?  It's a simple question. You never wore a seat belt before/ Maggie.  I just asked a simple question. You're the one that brought it up with the affair.  You know what I'm doing.  I'm doing the job. That's the job.  It's for your own protection.  When did you all of a sudden from nowhere start saying, 'Do it', Maggie?  'Do it.' You never said that-- 'Do it'. You never talked that way before.  Tha t's a spe cial phone . You d on't call on i t. Yo u don 't answer it. Nobody touches that phone under any circumstances. Understood?  Hey.   Heyl  He turns again. Again, the car FOLLOWS. Donnie looks again in the rear-view mirror. Something FAMILIAR about that car...Turns again. A scowl of RECOGNITION plays across Donnie's face. And he goes COLD...Approaching an intersection:  Meanwhile three years I've been .undercover and I can't get a fucking two thousand dollar raise.    I supervise my prick. Not even t hree year s--thr ee an d a h alf years.  Fuggedaboudit.  I need 40 grand, I gotta middle some porno tapes.  you'll get it back. It's nothing. Half of them are for fags.  You take out the firing pin. The guns don't work. What the fuck are you worried about?  Why not?  Hey, Guy, you have to explain this to Washington, that's your fucking job. For me to do my job I need the fucking guns.  I don't give a fuck about the fucking procedures. You think they have fucking procedures? Hah? I want the fucking guns and I want the fucking money. Understood?  Santo Trafficante--how long's he been the boss o f Florida? You could put his head on your wall. If I go down to Florida and vouch for this jerkoff, whatever his n ame is--  Every door in Florida will open for this guy Calvin like it. was on ball fucking bearings. But I w an t t he gu ns . T h e mo n ey . A nd no more fucking bullshit.  Donnie.  Don't waste my time.       With all this bullshit about pr     ocedures, you'11 do whatever it       takes to get t hese guys. Same      as m e.  If I vouch for this guy and he fucks up--I'll put a bullet in his fucking head.  .. .We got the Colts giving two- and-a -half. Yea h, Nickel on the Colts.  What're we selling that for? I know a guy I think I could off them to.  W hat about Florida? I know a g uy down there, he has some vending machines he's trying to move.  Plus he has a club down there. He's looking for partners that can give him peace of mind. You know this guy?  I knew him ten years ago, in Baltimore. He was okay then.  Tampa.  What?  I didn't inject anything, Left.  I don't know, Left. I was just bullshitting around.  I know.          ·  You don't explain it to me.  Snake in the grass,  I was agreeing with you.  What are you so upset for? This could be great.  I ' m not gonna do nothing wrong.    What do you thi nk I'm doi ng? I'm working.  as a Dancer bends over, waggles her bare butt...  No, I didn't forget.  I ' m gonna try. Look, Maggie, I gotta go.  I'll be there, okay? I gotta go. ' Bye.  I love you.  So whaddaya think?  Lik e any body else . I k new h im ten years ago, he was okay then.  Look, I'm just making the introduction. You make the decision.  It's up to you, Left.  You know him? Trafficante?  I know a broad down here, her brother has a boat. Big fucking yacht.  What?  It's like part of their religion, Left . I t's ca lle d se lf- flage llation. T hey think it'll  I need a boat. Lefty loves boa ts. B e wan ts s ometh ing special to show off for Trafficanta.  Yeah. What happened to my expense check? It's gotta be three months already.  Donnie. Call me Donnie. I gotta get reimbursed, Jules. It's fucking ridiculous.  Donnie Brasco has the worst fucking credit rating in the history of the Mafia.  Not Nicky. Nicky Cigars.  Kiss Jones, how many do I have solid?  Nicky Glasses. Little Nicky.  Donnie. Call me Donnie. I don't wanna get confused.    You gonna spend any money to fix it up or is it gonna stay a dump?    What about the boat? I need that fucking boat. You know, I ask Berada to do something and he just says, 'Done'.  Just get me that fucking boat, okay?  Perfect.          Hah? with his fucking pencil prick?    Fucking guy pissing up my leg.  You can't even go to the fucking airport any more without some fucking Hare Krishna or somebody puts his hand in your pocket.    Shit.  Terry ? You awak e?  I ' m sorry I missed your party.  I ' m not the kind of guy that breaks his promises.  I'm sure that's only part of what Mom said.  W ha t' d s he sa y-- sh e w an ts a divorce? That's just her way of blowing off steam.  Nothing's gonna happen to me, Terry. Nothing's gonna happen to us -- I won't le t it. Okay ?  I ' m doing the right thing. I know i t's a sac rifice. It 's the same thing I always tell you kids -- do your best, work hard, never quit. That's how I live my life. I just had no way of knowing it would go this far.  You're getting grown-up now. I want you to understand.  You have a father, Terry.  Maybe I'm not there for the good times, but I'm there if you need me.  It's just another six months.  Come here. Give me a hug.  Okay. I called this family meeting because there's something we have to t alk a bout. I kn ow what I'm doing involves a lot of sacrifice from everyone, but this is something patriotic for the country that you can all be proud of. I called the meeting because we're gonna have to move.  This isn't a democracy, Terry. This is a dictatorsh ip. And that's my decision. It's getting too dangerous.  There's too many people here who know us.  We're moving to Minnesota and changing our name to 'Anderson'. That's the deal. It's done.  That language is unacceptable, y oung lady . You sit down.  Where are you going? Don't you want to discuss this?  You'll make new friends.  Minnesota's great. Lakes and everything. We can get a nice piece of land there. Maybe we can even get a horse.  What's this?  Sonny Red and all them big puffers.  Hey, Left.  He can stick Jersey up his ass.  Once Lefty arranged it with Trafficante--  Simple arithmetic.  Some young guy.  You just gotta take it with a grain of salt.  Fuggedaboudit. Be a made guy? That would be unbelievable.  as he calculates the advantages and dangers of his new offer...  I just got some things I gotta take care of, back in the city.  How long's he gonna stay down there?  Nobody calls me cocksucker. Understood?  I'm not getting it.   No fucking way, Left.  That's got nothing to do with it.  I got no fucking loyalty to Sonny Black. That ain't the issue.  Nobody calls me cocksucker.  You're the fucking cocksucker. H uh? Yo u f uck ing coc ksu cke r--h ow does it feel?.  Go ahead, Left. Fucking whack m e . S t a b m e. R ig h t i n th e fucking baggage claim.  Whack me! Because you know what? You make me so fucking mad I'm gonna whack you and then I'm gonna get whacked for whacking you anyway!  I ain't picking up the bag.  I ain't.  with the Nagra in it. The Maitre d' waits for Donnie's shoes, GESTURES...Donnie thinking fast...  Get a load of this guy. (to Maitre d') How about you take off your fucking pants?  I'm not taking my shoes off for this guy.  Hey, Boobie, who won the fucking war?                                  :  I ain't doing it.  I grew up an orphan because my Dad took a fucking bullet in Okinawa, and I'll lose my boot up his fucking asshole before I'll           ' take orders from fucking Mr. Moto here.  GRABS the Maitre d' and RAMS him through the doors of the MEN'S   ROOM.  On yo ur ma rk s. Ge t s et . Go!  into the darkness...Sees them DISAPPEAR into the trees.  Adrenaline rushes through him. As 'he turns, and turns, and WAITS... For the bullet that will kill him...  Jogs a couple of steps to find some cover... Then hears  Boobie falls heavily... BLOOD belches out of his mouth...  Sonny found out about it?  How'd he find out?  Sonny.  I don't know, Left. Boobie was a friend, of all of us.  What are you talking about?  You told Sonny that Boobie was holding out?  Because of me? What was Boobie saying?  Donnie holds the Nagra in his hand. The SOUNDS of the murder as it plays. . . .  the pile of TRASH in the well of the car--McDonald's wrappers, Tampax wrappers, a copy of Mademoiselle, a lipstick, a basketball.. DUMPS it. Pulls out the ASHTRAY. Something that makes him suspicious...  between his fingers. RECOGNITION. . .He DIGS into the space between the se ats. Fin ds a quart er. A pape r clip. A nd then:  Where's Terry? She still asleep?  As lee p. Perf ect . A sle ep at 1 2 noon. It all fits the profile.  The twelve warning signs. Our daughter Terry is a drug user.  Oversleeping. Short attention span. Hostility to authority. B in g e e at i n g--  Don't tell me my business. Do you know what this is?  This is a marijuana seed.  Maggie, I am an FBI agent. That's who I am. I am out there risking my life, 18, 20 hours a day, weekends, Christmas--  Well, what do you think     I ' m doing it for? I am spending      my life to put away the guys that     make money off this shit, and I'm      damned to hell if I ' m gonna have    it in my house.  Don't change the subject.  I'm not the fucking pothead.  Geddadaheah. Go weigh yourself or something. Sleeping Beauty and I are going out to the woodshed.  In the fucking car that I make the payments on, in the fucking driveway of the house that I pay the fucking mortgage on--a goddam m ar i ju an a s e ed --  I'm looking for my wife. Mrs. An der son. Ma ggi e A nde rson . S he was i n an accid ent? I'm h er husband.  Where is she?  Is she okay?  Christ. Let me just see her. She'll tell you who I am.  If I could see her we could clear this whole thing up.  I need ID to see my fucking wife? I ' m her husband1 Who the fuck else would I be?  Can't I see her?  Look, Mom's gonna be okay.  I know how you're feeling. But i t ' s j u s t--  Maybe just a few more weeks.  The doctor says you    're    gonna be okay. We j ust have     to    get you into rehabilitation     as    soon as we can. You'll be as      goo   d as new before you know it.  Maggie, listen to me, Maggie, because this is what it is. The minute I come out from under all these guys I ' m with, they will all be killed--because of me. Because they trusted me. I gotta go back.  I have a chance here to become a in th e Mafia. I t's gonna happen the en d of the year. And then I'll come out. Then it'll all be rest of your life.  Look, I think that sitdown's tonight. I can't find Lefty.  Only made guys can go to a s itdown.  I don't know. Listen to me--I ' m worried.  Carrying his mail, Donnie enters a DARK room. MOONLIGHT filters through the blinds. He closes the door. Flips the light switch.  The electric bill...I can't get over it...The fucking 'B' didn't pay the fucking electric billI  as he looks at the gun in his hand.  Maybe he ain't gonna show.  I ' m just saying--maybe we should forget about it, pop him tomorrow night.  I forgot.  of the deserted marina...  That's some boat this broad has.  What is that--a hundred grand?  Florence.  In the distance, a TRANS AM pulls up near the boat they're watching, Bruno emerges. Locks his car. Climbs onto the boat...  C'mon, that's him.  Hey, Left--what do you care, Florence what? Florence Italy.  I ' m not lying.  Hey, Left--that's the problem? Are we gonna whack this guy or what?  What is tne fucking problem?  I really don't think that's the same boat, Left.  Maybe her brother's a fucking a ge nt . H o w wo u ld I kn o w? I thought he was in real estate.  You're right, Left. I'm a fucking rat.  I met your girls. I talked to Tommy for you I don't know how many fucking times. I don't know how many times I had dinner with you and Louise. I lived with you, Left-- partners. Five fucking years, I ever had a hundred bucks in my pocket, I gave you half. And the whole time I was a fucking rat. You're right.  You'd have to be the biggest fucking mutt in the history of the Mafia.  as Bruno emerges from the boat. Lights a cigarette. Looks around,  Shit. He's up again.  You ask me it's the funniest fucking thing in the world. Those fucking agents could scam Senators and Congressmen and meanwhile we had a party on their boat and they didn't get a fucking thing on us. Sonny'11 laugh his ass off.  We outsmarted the agents. We got a higher Z .Q. than the fuckin g Congressmen.  What black marks?  Are we gonna whack this fucking guy or not?  That's right, Left--you're my best friend.  What do you mean, it's over?  What the fuck--? Nobody--. I'm not coming out.  It's not over. I'm too close!  at the FBI Academy at Quantico, then with Berada, LeBow and other FBI MEN, as Marshall and Jules show them to Sonny/ Nicky and Boobie.  Photos of Lefty's rooftop.

A final CRAWL runs over this* The evidence collected by \"Donnie Brasco\" led to over 200 indictments.",
        "Sonny": "Lefty, how you gonna be mad at Nicky?  what the fuck are you arguing about? Mercedes got it all over both of them.  Angel, how about some pastries for the table?  as he punctuates his order with KISSES of her hand.  A little cannoli.  Svingi. Zeppole. Sfogliateli'.  Oh. Then you gotta give me that kiss back.  What makes you think we're wiseguys?         Hey, Left--ride up front with me.  Ain't this beautiful, the ride on this?  Which broad is this?    Hey, Left, what'cha doing?    We all gotta go sometime.  After you.  Look, Left, he likes you.  That's for you, Left. For your birthday. Batter late than never.  Yeah, why? Whaddayou think, you was gonna get whacked?  What, over that 175 grand you owe down in Little Italy? Don't worry, chooch.  Now you owe it to me.  The Lion sniffs. Lefty tugs on the leash. The Lion resists, sniffs some more. Lefty tugs harder.

You ever off that load of sunglasses?  Will you stop it with that?  What are you gonna get out of that, Left? Fifty bucks?  You know, you guys--you don't fucking think. I'm the skipper now-- I gotta answer. Sonny Red's got 75 million alone }ust with that trucking company out in Jersey and I got fifty bucks of fucking dimes.  You're like a bunch of fucking niggers on welfare.  Where in Florida? The Beach?  In a RAGE, he stands up, THROWS HIS CHAIR, knocks over the card table.  You think this is a fucking joke? Hah? One day I ' m gonna die, and I ' m gonna be in this same fucking room, with these same fucking guys, talking about these same fucking scams that never amount to anything, and that's how I'll know I got sent to fucking Hell.  I can't even imagine it. What kind of people--in broad fucking dayli ght-- what kind of a worl d--  They stole the Mercedes.    I don't know what the world's coming to. I honestly don't.  Hey, Lefty, why didn't you bring Louise?    Isn't she spunky?  Lot of broads into that.  You see how smart he's getting, Donnie, reading that paper?    The man down here says okay?  He knows who you are?  Left, you wanna take care of the bags? We'll be in the lounge.  Cozz'. that's beautiful.  That's some fucking irony, ain't .it?  You can live your life like a man d own here. I bet if you took m y blood pressure right now it'd be down o ne hundre d per cent . Sonny Red's got Jersey and we got Florida, and Florida's better than Jersey, right?  This is a great idea I had, Florida.  Fuggedaboudit. What Lefty don't understand is guys like Trafficante, their day is done.  A 70 year old brain can't compare with guys like us, because where he's got like 20 more years experience .in his day, we got 50 more years in our day. And we're l iving in our day. C apeesh?

When you come back, you represent me in Florida.  Donnie--I ' m hungry and I ain't in the mood.  Take off your fucking shoes or I ' m gonna chop off your fucking legs.  I wanna fucking eat, Donnie.

I'm telling you, it's good to be back in New York. That fucking Florida baked everybody's brain. when Sonny gets out of the fucking sun he's gonna realize what a miserable fucking idea you had.
