        "Beth": "Elyse feels that Eddie is getting very sensitive about the wedding.  She thinks that since he never talked it over with Billy beforehand, it kind of bothers him even more.  I didn't hear about it. Thought he was just coming in for the wedding day.  Elyse's mother is very upset with Eddie. They picked out a yellow and white motif for the wedding. You know, like we did, tablecloth, napkins, maids-,of-honor. Anyway, Eddie objected. He wanted blue and white because that's The Colts' colors. Refused to give in.  Eddie, where's Elyse?

    "description": "Early twenty-something Baltimoreans Eddie, Shrevie, Boogie, Billy, Fenwick and Modell have been friends since they were kids, and the center of their lives has been and still is the Fells Point Diner. In the last week of 1959, Baltimore Colts fanatic Eddie is scheduled to marry Elyse on New Year's Eve, but might call it off if she doesn't pass his Colts quiz on the 29th. Inexperienced Eddie turns to the only other married one of their bunch, electronics salesman and music aficionado Shrevie, for advice, but Shrevie might not be the best marriage advisor since he doesn't yet realize he probably married his wife Beth for the wrong reasons. Beth has lost her sense of identity, is unhappy in her marriage, and contemplates having an affair with someone who provides what she believes is a sympathetic shoulder. Hairdresser and law school student Boogie is the player of the bunch and has major financial problems because of his quest for the fast buck. Generally strait-laced Billy, Eddie's best man who has been away getting his MBA, has come back to Baltimore a few days early to clarify his relationship with his girlfriend Barbara. Smart-aleck Fen is a college dropout who lives off his trust fund and doesn't much like his family--just what their money can buy him. And insecure Modell is afraid to ask for anything directly. As 1960 approaches, they collectively deal with how to truly be adults.—Huggo",
