        "Indiana": "by     And... POW!... he's punched in the face while his arms are pinned behind his back.",
        "Jones": "by     And... POW!... he's punched in the face while his arms are pinned behind his back.    The Ford coupe pulls up in front of the house. INDY climbs from the car and hurries up the walkway. BRODY is a step behind.",
        "Grail": "But we can't see the Grail Knight's face. The visor of his helmet is down. Perhaps we see his eyes.      looks through the falling debris to INDY and HENRY. SALLAH and BRODY rush from the crumbling Temple.",
        "Knight": "But we can't see the Grail Knight's face. The visor of his helmet is down. Perhaps we see his eyes.     I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.   The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.   A long time to wait.  The GRAIL KNIGHT reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing.   You're strangely dressed...for a knight.   I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.  The GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY.   You must choose.  But choose wisely. For as the True Grail will bring you life the False Grail will take it from you.   He chose...poorly.  INDY studies the array of chalices.                You have chosen wisely. But the             Grail cannot pass beyond the             Great Seal. That is the boundary             and the price of immortality.   CUT TO BRODY AND SALLAH who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return.  INDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail.  The TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail. They put down their guns and kneel.  INDY kneels by HENRY's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to his lips.  HENRY is too weak to even open his eyes.  HENRY swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the corners of his mouth. Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The color returns to Henry's face.  HENRY's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up. Then they shift to INDY's faceand they light up even more...    looks through the falling debris to INDY and HENRY. SALLAH and BRODY rush from the crumbling Temple.",
        "Elsa": "Doctor Jones?   I knew it was you  She looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious.                          you have your father's eyes.  INDY is instantly attracted to her.   Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.  INDY grins, enjoying the repartee. The WOMAN turns to BRODY, who tips his hat.   Marcus Brody?    Doctor Elsa Schneider.  INDY's grin fades. BRODY registers a look of surprise.   The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.   I usually don't.   In that case, I permit you.  INDY gives her the flower.   But I'm already sadby tomorrow it will have faded.    Yes. I have something to show you.  She hands a slip of paper to INDY.    I left your father working in the library. He sent me to the map section to fetch an ancient plan of the city. When I got back to his tablehe'd gonewith all his papersexcept for that scrap which I found near his chair.  INDY extends the scrap of paper to BRODY.   Here is the library.  They have arrived at the front steps of the library.   In this case it's the literal truth. We're on holy ground. These columns over here...  She indicates FOUR HUGE MARBLE COLUMNS that go from floor to ceiling.   ... were brought back as spoils of war after the sacking of Byzantium during the Crusades.    Now please excuse me. The library's closing in a few moments. I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer.  The minute ELSA is out of earshot.   Find something?  INDY doesn't reply. He's looking in five directions at once. His eyes moving across the walls and ceilingscharged with the thrill of discovery.    My God, I must be blind   You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.   Lower me down.  INDY is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeablyholding her by the hands and lowering her into the hole. When her feet finally touch ground below, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to BRODY.   Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.   The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.  INDY takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway.   What's this one?  INDY only has to give it a quick glance to know.   Are you sure?   Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.  One coffin is elevated above the others.   It's this one.  Together they begin to push on the lidSTRAINING and GROANING until it slides away and BANGS against the stone platform.    What's that?   Just like your fathergiddy as a schoolboy.  INDY laughs.   Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?    ELSA holds the torch. INDY looks around. Listens. Something is wrong. And then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing across the Catacomb walls.  This is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around the corner of the Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward ELSA and INDYSHRIEKING and SQUEALING as they approach.  The rats literally wash over themlike a rodent tidal wavein their efforts to escape a:     What?  INDY disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin.   What?   Go between them? Are you crazy?!  INDY finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish Agent flying overboard. Turning, Indy sees that ELSA has committed the speedboat to a course BETWEEN the two Freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat.   You said go between them!    spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT appear racing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, FIRING A MACHINE GUN at INDY and ELSA.    No!!  INDY kicks KAZIM in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back into the boat, now being SUCKED THROUGH THE CHURNING WATER toward the Steamer's giant propeller blades.    ... and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own. The room is empty.  He is worried for her, knocks and calls out:    Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe. She gasps, startled, as INDY enters. He retreats back into her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a record player sitting on a ledge above the bathtub.     ELSA joins INDY, waiting in the ransacked room. she looks around in shock.   My room!  What were they looking for?  She looks to INDY, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket.   The Grail Diary.   You had it? You didn't trust me!  She looks hurt and beautiful. She comes closer to him.   Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.   No?   It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.  She stomps her foot angrily. INDY flinches. She starts to walk away but Indy grabs her.   How dare you kiss me!  Now ELSA reaches for INDY and kisses him.   And I hate arrogant men.  INDY smiles slyly as they fall to the bed.    I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.   What are you going to do?   How do you know?  INDY points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE.   Indy? Indy?  INDY reassures her.    Indy, please!   Indy, no!   Indy, please! Do what he says!   I'm sorry.  INDY comforts her.   But you should have listened to your father.  She steps back next to VOGEL. INDY is stunned. HENRY gives him his most withering look of reprimand.    This book contained a mapa map with no namesprecise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.    You're wasting your breath. He won't tell us. And he doesn't have to... it's perfectly obvious where the pages are...  ... he's given them to Marcus Brody.  HENRY now wears a pained expression.   So?   Thank you, Herr Oberst.  I will meet you at Iskenderun.   No. If we fail to recover the pages from Brody, we'll need them alive.   Don't look at me like thatwe both wanted the Grail, I would have done anything to get it. You would have done the same.  INDY shakes his head \"no.\"    I can't forget... how wonderful it was.        (to INDY, after       finishing the kiss That's how Austrians say goodbye.  ELSA exits. VOGEL stays behind for another moment.    How did you get here?   You came back for the book? Whv?   Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.    You do.  Now it's as though she'd slapped him back. His hands fly to her neck.   All I have to do is scream.  It's a standoff emotionally. He knows he'd never do it. she knows it too. And the same goes for screaming.  INDY releases her and backs away. she looks at him with a lover's pain. He moves over to HENRY.   We have no time to lose. Indiana Jones and his father have escaped.   No. It's him all right. He's here somewhere.    They look down at KAZIM who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet. ELSA looks saddened.    watch him from a safe distance.    She looks at him, horrified.     I never expected to see you again.   No!!     Let me choose.   It would not be made out of gold.  INDY picks up another cupa simple earthenware jug.    steps forward and picks up the Grail. She turns to INDY, her face alight with possession of the Grail.   We have got it. Come on.  ELSA steps onto the edge of the Great Seal.   It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.   I can reach it. I can reach it...  Her hand begins to slip from Indy's grasp.",
        "Kazim": "matches Indy's move for move.   Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.   No.   If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.    My soul is prepared. How's yours?  By now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are getting closer.   No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!  The wind of the blades is on their necks. INDY grabs KAZIM just in time and jumps... into the motorboat, driven by ELSA, which gets alongside in the nick of time.   If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.   My name is Kazim.   The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.  KAZIM pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark... or is it a tattoo? Whatever it is, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of a broadsword.   Let me get off at this jetty.  The boat is close to the edge of the canal. INDY gives ELSA a nod, telling her to bring the boat in. KAZIM steps ashore.    Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?   In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.  KAZIM walks away.   A messenger from God. For the unrighteous, the Cup of Life holds everlasting damnation.  KAZIM dies.",
        "Young": "",
        "Henry": "Out!   Then waitcount to twenty.     In Greek.  INDY's reaction:   May he who illuminated this... illuminate me...    The Ford coupe pulls up in front of the house. INDY climbs from the car and hurries up the walkway. BRODY is a step behind.   Junior?  INDY gets to his feet.   It is you Junior!    But what are you doing here?    Late Fourteenth Century, Ming Dynasty.  HENRY is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand. Father and son get onto crossed lines for a couple of moments.   Oh, it breaks the heart.        (referring to the       vase I'll never forgive myself   Thank God!    ... it's fake. See, you can tell by the cross section.  HENRY throws the vase against the wall where it SHATTERS.   Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.    Good point.  INDY steps to the door and stands, listening.   But better safe than sorry.  HENRY slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag.   Humpfso I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.    Through the library?   I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?     He was actually there? You saw him?          (trembling with        anticipation And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?   Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...  INDY winces, and would interrupt but suddenly it's not the moment.   ... you did it.    If only I could have been with you.   Rats?   They want my diary.    I knew I had to get that book as far away from me as I possibly could.  INDY's hand moves unconsciously to his pocket. His eyes turn inward.    What book?   You doltl Do you think that my son would be that stupid that he would bring my Diary all the way back here?  At which point an awful thought strikes HENRY.   You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?    You did!!    I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.   Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?         (points towards         the NAZIS So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!   Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??  INDY's eyes blazes His nostrils flares He's so pissed off, he literally RIPS A MACHINE GUN from the hands of one of the startled soldiers... and for a moment we think he's going to use it on his dad.   Look what you did!!  Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead.    I can't believe what you just....   But she's one of them!   She's a Nazi!   Trust me!    Oh yeah? Go ahead!    Don't worry. He won't.   And don't listen to her!   Umh?   She talks in her sleep.  INDY nods, and then the statement catches up with him. He looks at HENRY with surprise.   I didn't trust her. Why did you?   I misjudged you WalterI knew you'd sell your mother for an Etruscan vase. But I didn't know you'd sell your country and your soul to the slime of humanity.    Marcus?! You didn't drag poor Marcus along, did you? He's not up to the challenge.   Intolerable.    Thank you. It was rather wonderful.  She smiles and kisses INDY passionately. HENRY glances back and looks rather disappointed.  VOGEL appears to remind ELSA of her appointment.   Ohh. . .  VOGEL exits. INDY shakes his head clear.   So did I.    You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!   What am I looking for?   Feels like a cigarette lighter.    Very good.  HENRY yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops the lighter to the floor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to burn. INDY doesn't know it yet.   I ought to tell you something.   The floor's on fire! See?!   And the chair.   What?   What?   What?   Oh.   BANGING, ROCKING and HOPPING their chairs, they work their way INTO THE FIREPLACEthe only safe place from the now ROARING FIRE.   Our situation has not improved.  INDY glances over his shoulder at HENRY.   This is intolerable!   Well done, boy!    The RADIOMEN move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one hand, holding their guns with the other. Is it possible that INDY and HENRY escaped through these flames?  Not a chance.  They've hidden themselves UP THE CHIMNEY. And now they DROP DOWN, BEHIND the RADIOMEN.  One of the RADIOMEN grabs INDY by the neck. As they struggle they fall against the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened HENRY behind.  HENRY presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he disappears into the next room, a DEAD NAZI RADIOMAN swivels into the room. The other NAZIS rush forward to him.   I find that if I just sit down and think...  HENRY sits on a chair which tips back, hitting the wall behind it. The floor at INDY's feet suddenly begins DROPPING AWAYI  INDY grabs a railing to keep from falling, but loses his grip and plunges through the opening which has formed a SPIRAL STAIRCASE. He rolls down the stairs.                      ... the solution presents itself.  HENRY follows INDY down the staircase.    Would you say this has been just another typical day for you? Huh?  HENRY tosses his case at INDY who catches it and angrily throws it back to his father.   What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?       INDY grabs at a FLAGPOLE as they roar pastit snaps off in his hand.  The NAZI SOLDIER drives his motorcycle toward INDY and HENRY. He unshoulders his machine gun.  INDY uses the broken flagpole as a lance and knocks the NAZI SOLDIER from his motorcycle.    As the remaining NAZI SOLDIER rides alongside their motorbike he cocks his gun, preparing to fire.  INDY quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole through the spokes of the Nazi's front wheel.  The NAZI SOLDIER'S MOTORCYCLE FLIPS THREE TIMES, throwing him high into the air.    Stop!   Stop! Stop!  The motorbike skids to a stop.    You're going the wrong Way!  We have to get to Berlin!   My Diary's in Berlin.   There is more in the Diary than just the map.   Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.   Three devices of such lethal cunning.   Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.   I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember   Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.   Marcus would agree with me.   That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?   Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.   My boy, we are Pilgrims in an unholy land.  Then... Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. WE PAN ALONG HIS LINE OF SIGHT to:   What did you get?   Good.  INDY and HENRY show their papers to the Boarding Guards, then join the line of passengers, which has already begun to move toward a:    When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.   You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.   Well, I'm as human as the next man.    Ships that pass in the night...  HENRY opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it.   Hmmm... What did we talk about?   And do I detect a rebuke?   Actually, I was a wonderful father.   Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self- reliance.    You left just when you were becoming interesting.    Very well. I'm here now.  He closes the Diary and leans back in his seat.   What do you want to talk about? Hmmm?  INDY stutters uncomfortably as HENRY stares at him, waiting for a response.   Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.         (he reads from the          Diary \"First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth. \"    I don't know. We'll find out.     I didn't know you could fly a plane.    shrink in their seats as the MESSERSCHMIDTS (going three times as fast as they are) SCREAM past on either side.   What happens at eleven o'clock?  INDY uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a direction and not a time.   More or less.   Son, I'm sorry. They got us.  INDY looks back at the missing tail section, then at his father.  The plane begins to go down. INDY struggles to control its descent.    Nice landing.   Those people are trying to kill us!   It's a new experience for me.   This is intolerable!   Faster, boy --faster!    Well, they don't come any closer than that!  HENRY looks out the windshield and sees the second Messerschmidt SCREAMING out of the sky toward them.     exchange a wordless glance. They don't even think about running: there is no place to run to. HENRY hands his case to INDY.  Holding his umbrella, HENRY suddenly spins around and runs screaming and shouting into A FLOCK OF SEA GULLS...  THE SEA GULLS take to the wing in flight. Thousands of them.   I suddenly remembered Charlemagne. \"Let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky.\"   INDY wears a proud expression as he watches HENRY walk down the beach.    Now they have the map! And in this sort of race, there's no silver medal for finishing second.    What do you think you're doing?! Get down!   Now, who are all these people?   Marcus!   \"Genius of the Restoration\"  Now BRODY tugs his ears, flaps his arms and touches his head.   It's a rescue, old boys Come on.   As HENRY starts to climb out of the tank, TWO NAZI SOLDIERS DROP DOWN from above, their Lugers drawn. They are followed by VOGEL.   It tells me that goose-stepping morons like yourself should try reading books instead of burning them.  DONOVAN appears at the turret cover.   Junior? Junior? Junior!  The NAZI SOLDIER swings his fist, knocking HENRY off his seat.    What?    It's war.    Didn't I tell you it was a rescue, huh?  A NAZI SOLDIER appears and pulls HENRY down.  VOGEL raises the shovel above his head and brings it crashing down on INDY, still hanging from the protruding gun.  INDY loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended only by the strap of his leather pouch. He screams as the gun scrapes against the cliff wall, sending stones tumbling down over him.    You call this archaeology?    Where's Marcus?!  Before INDY can answer, VOGEL is up and swinging with the shovel. Indy ducks but the shovel catches HENRY sending him over the side and onto the moving tread.  INDY grabs his whip, knocking VOGEL aside.  As HENRY speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, INDY, with lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around Henry's right ankle.   Junior?!  We HEAR the TANK EXPLODING.   Oh, God. I've lost him. And I never told him anything. I just wasn't ready, Marcus. Five minutes would have been enough.  And then... looking dazed and bewildered, INDY STAGGERS UP BEHIND THEM. He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below with a bewildered expression.  Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence.  HENRY says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he throws his arms around him.   I thought I'd lost you, boy.  After a moment, Indy's head clears. And he becomes aware of his father's embrace. Something he hasn't felt in a long timeif ever. And it touches him. He hugs his father back.   Wellwell done! Come on!  HENRY pats INDY on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff edge.     Let's go then. why are you sitting there resting when we're so near the end? Come on let's go!  HENRY turns and walks toward the horse with BRODY and SALLAH. Suddenly the FEDORA, borne on the wind, BLOWS INTO SCENE and lands at INDY's feet.     react to the sight.    Junior. . .    \"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass.\"   The penitent man. The penitent...  INDY takes a step forward through the cobwebs.     Penitent. Penitent...   No.    lifts his head painfully.    The Word of God...     The Name of God...    still lies in SALLAH's arms. BRODY leans over him.    But in the Latin alphabet, \"Jehovah\" begins with an \"I.\"     reacts.    Oh dear!    calls to his son.    You must believe, boy. you must... believe.  We see him do it. We see him leap into space. We see that he is in midair. We see that he is not going to make it. His hands claw for the opposite wall but he is going to fall 100 feet to his death. And thenhe doesn't! He appears to be held up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees.  INDY looks around and down and now he figures it out.  Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks 100 feet below. It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet are stepping.  It's painted to blend in with the rocks below. Highly evolved camouflage... in perfect alignment with everything we see below.  When INDY leans out to the left or right... that's when he sees the perfect alignment shift that betrays the trick. Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and he crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.  Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple.  A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple. Perhaps a hundred or more. Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all glitter and shine.  INDY is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. And then he realizes that a man is praying at the altarl  He has his back turned to INDY... but he is dressed as what he is! A GRAIL  Junior!  Junior!  With her free hand, ELSA is trying to get the Grail. INDY can't save her unless she gives him her free hand. She has to choose.   Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!   Indiana. Indiana!!  INDY snaps his look up to his father. His father has never called him this before.     ... let it go...   INDY abandons the Grail and grabs onto HENRY with both hands. HENRY pulls him up to safety.    Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.   Me?... Illumination.  HENRY and INDY mount their horses. Henry turns back to his son.   What did you find, Junior?   That's his name. Henry Jones, Junior.   We named the dog Indiana.   Ready.    Got lost in his own museum, huh?   After you, Junior.",
        "Marcus": "",
        "Brody": "You've got itl  INDY removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk. He places it on the desk and takes off his glasses as BRODY examines the Cross.   All your life.   Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.  INDY gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door.   Yes. My treat.   Your father and I have been friends since time began. I've watched you grow up, Indy. And I've watched the two of you grow apart.  I've never seen you this concerned about him before.  They climb the porch and notice that the front door is ajar. They exchange a quick look of concern as they enter.                           Dear God.  They walk into the room.    What has the old fool got himself into now?          It's today's mail. And it's been opened.  INDY turns and sees the pile of torn papers and envelopes. Then something hits him.   What is it?   INDY uncovers a small book. It looks like a JOURNAL or DIARY. Indy flips through it: Page after page of handwritten notes and drawings. BRODY glances at it with great curiosity.   I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.   The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.  BRODY sees that INDY is unsatisfied by this response.   But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.   I'll tell him we'll take two.    Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?    Schneider?   Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.  BRODY and DONOVAN shake hands. INDY steps from the back seat of the limo. He turns back to Donovan and shakes his hand.   Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?   That's right.  The Woman, DR. ELSA SCHNEIDER, extends her hand to BRODY.   Uh... how do you do?    I hate to interrupt youbut the reason we're here   It looks like a converted church.  ELSA leads the way inside.    Where?  INDY whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the airplane.   Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!   Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.  INDY and BRODY now see ELSA approaching. Indy quickly tucks the Diary back into his pocket.    Uh, yes. Three, seven and tent That window seems to be the source of the Roman numerals.   Ohhhh. . .  KAZIM gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious BRODY. The other two men take Brody's hands and drag him into one of the book-lined aisles.   It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. \"Alexandretta?\" Hmmm...  INDY, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression.   Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.  BRODY picks up the Grail Diary.   He must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the Grail Quest. A map with no names.    Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.   Yes. Now we know.   What about you?   Does anyone here speak English? Or even ancient Greek?  A Man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to BRODY.   No water, no thank you. No, fish make love in it.  BRODY continues through the crowd past various STREET VENDORS. A Woman holds a chicken out to him.   Thank you so much. No, I don't like that. No, I really don't want... No, no, thank you very much. No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.   The Woman walks away, leaving BRODY alone in the crowd.   Does anyone understand a word I'm saying here?  SALLAH shoulders his way through the mob toward BRODY.   Oh, Sallahl What a relief!    Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.   Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you. . .have you arranged our supplies?   Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...  BRODY searches in his coat pocket for the map as a SINISTER MAN approaches.   Oh, what?... your servant, sir.   My reputation precedes me.   Yes.   Yes.    Did you say...? Uh, uh...  SALLAH puts the newspaper in front of the SECOND MAN's face, then punches him through the newspaper.   I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...  VOGEL snatches the canteen away from BRODY before he can drink.   You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.  HENRY and SALLAH are at INDY's side as he views Donovan's party in the distance. Parked nearby is a CAR containing all of their supplies.   Arghhh! Oh!    \"aid our own resuscitation!\"  They exchange a handshake.   Henryl What are you doing here?!   Henry, the pen   But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.    Look what you didl   How does one get off this thing?  As INDY winds up to punch VOGEL he catches BRODY in the face on the backswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down.    react to the sight.    No, Henry. Try not to talk.     rushes forward and calls to INDY.   Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!   May we go home now, please?     Indy! Henryl Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!",
        "Vogel": "That's far enough Put down the gun, Doctor Jones. Put down the gun or the Fraulein dies.   I will kill her!   Enough! She diesl  VOGEL jams the barrel of the luger painfully into ELSA's neck. Elsa SCREAMS.   Doctor Schneider. Message from Berlin. You must return immediately: a rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture.   Your presence on the platform is requested... at the highest level.            (to DONOVAN, meaning           Indy and Henry Let me kill them now.    Doctor Schneider! Your car is waiting.   And this is how we say goodbye in Germany, Doctor Jones.  VOGEL punches INDY in the jaw. A hard and vicious jab that snaps Indy's head around.   Sie alle ins Boat. Schnell!  CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a large box which suddenly BREAKS APART as INDY, now on a motorbike with HENRY in the sidecar, ROARS PAST THE DOCK, hitting TWO NAZI SOLDIERS who scream as they fall into the river.  VOGEL screams after INDY and HENRY as they drive off.   rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin.   Nicht zumachen! Wir steigen ein!    now walks up the aisle. He approaches a MALE PASSENGER hidden behind a newspaper. VOGEL uses his walking stick to lower the newspaper and show the Passenger the leaflet with Henry's photograph.   Haben sie disen Mann gesehen?  The Passengers at the table shake their heads in the negative. VOGEL shows the picture to other Passengers.    approaches HENRY, still hidden behind his newspaper. Again, VOGEL uses his walking stick to lower the paper, revealing Henry's face.   Guten Tag, Herr Jones.  Now INDY, still playing the role of Steward, asks VOGEL for his ticket.   Weg.    Was?    VOGEL glances up and recognizes INDYwho quickly punches Vogel in the face, knocking him toward the window. In another quick move, Indy TOSSES HIM OUT THE WINDOW onto the tarmac below.  Shocked Passengers blink in bewilderment.   Du wirst nochmal boren von mir!   Bring den Schatzl  TWO NAZI SOLDIERS bring forward a HUGE STEAMER TRUNK. They open the lid and begin to empty it of its contents:  Gold and silver objects of every description.   We must be within three or four miles. Otherwise we are off the map.    I can't see anyone up there.     Search him.  The NAZI SOLDIERS point their guns at HENRY and BRODY.    What is in this book? That miserable little Diary of yours!  VOGEL removes a glove and slaps HENRY with it.   Here's the map. The book is useless, and yet you come all the way back to Berlin to get it. Why?  He slaps HENRY again.   What are you hiding?  Another slap.   What does the Diary tell you that it doesn't tell us?!  VOGEL reaches out to slap HENRY yet again, but Henry grabs his arm, stopping him.     I think not, Herr Donovan.    Fire!    Der Kubelwagon sprengen!  The Gunner puts a shell into the large gun. He FIRES, CATAPULTING THE KUBELWAGON into the air, where it EXPLODES.  The tank drives through the resulting smoke an dust, then rolls over the Kubelwagon, crushing it    Hate-staring at INDY      He sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top of his lungs!",
        "Sultan": "The SULTAN is seated in his royal chair, flanked by WALTER DONOVAN and VOGEL and surrounded by his minions.  DONOVAN holds the missing Grail Diary pages.   What have you brought?   Rolls-Royce Phantom Two. 4.3 litre, 30 horsepower, six cylinder engine, with Stromberg Downdraft carburetor.  The SULTAN points to the engine under the hood.   Can go from zero to 100 kilometres an hour in 12.5 seconds. And I even like the color.   You shall have camels, horses, an armed escort, provisions, desert vehiclesand tanksl",
        "Sallah": "Mister Brodyl  They meet and hug, then begin to walk.    Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?   You are on your own?  A Woman runs in and tugs on BRODY's coat. He waves her away.    Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?   And I am his.    There is no museum in Iskenderun.  The SECOND MAN overhears SALLAH. He and his companion turn quickly.   Papers?  Of course.    Run.   BRODY does not run. SALLAH pats his clothing, searching for his papers.   Papers, sir. Got it here.  SALLAH laughs and pulls out a newspaper.   Just finished reading it myself.          (laughs; then, to           Brody Run!  BRODY looks confused. SALLAH shows the newspaper to the SECOND MAN.   Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!   Run!   The SECOND MAN falls, knocking over a vendor's stand. SALLAH and BRODY begin to run. SALLAH knocks the FIRST MAN into another vendor's stand. The STAND COLLAPSES on impact.  SALLAH grabs BRODY and pulls him through the crowded streets.    Okay, okay, quick, quick, quickl Hide in that doorl Hide in that door!  SALLAH points to a DARKENED DOORWAY, hung with a curtain, at the top of a ramp. BRODY runs up the ramp, throws back the curtain and disappears into the darkness.    We go this way.  SALLAH waves his arms and shouts to a CAMEL HERDER.   Get that camel out of the way!    Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.  HENRY removes his hat and hits INDY with it.   That car belonged to my brother- in-law.    crouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the battle run amongst camels and horses.   I'll take the camels.   But, Indy   Compensation for my brother-in- law's car. Indy, your father and Brody   They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.  INDY and SALLAH charge forward leading their horses and camels.  Then VOGEL commands the Tank Driver to give chase.    Father of Indygive me your hand!  VOGEL now punches INDY in the back and grabs him around the neck. Still, INDY refuses to let go of the whip.   Give me your hand!  SALLAH manages to hold onto HENRY as he brings his horse to a stop just at the cliff's edge.  INDY finally frees himself of VOGEL's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away from Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head.    Indy?!     react to the sight.     He's all right.  HENRY shakes his head.   Drop your guns. Please.  The NAZI SOLDIERS drop their weapons at their feet and raise their arms in surrender.   Please...What does it always mean, this...this \"Junior?\"    The dog!?  You are named after the dog...",
        "Walter": "",
        "Donovan": "I trust your trip down was comfortable, Doctor Jones. My men didn't alarm you, I hope.  He shakes hands with INDY.   My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.   Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.                 Have a look over here. This might interest you.    That was our assessment as well.   My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?  Translating the inscription is no easy matter, even for someone as knowledgeable as INDY.    The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.  INDY rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the glass of champagne DONOVAN now offers him.   Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!   Every man's dream.        Including your father's, I believe.  INDY stiffens slightly at the mention of his father, nods.   Walter, you're neglecting our guests.   Be along in a moment, dear.  He leans over and kisses her cheek. MRS. DONOVAN sighs to herself and returns to the party. INDY, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the Grail Tablet, obviously hooked by its archaeological promise. He moistens his finger with champagne and rubs it over the tablet. DONOVAN steps up next to Indy.    Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!   Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.  INDY has to shake his head at DONOVAN's apparent lack of judgment.   Let me tell you another \"bedtime story, \" Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.   Not \"supposedly,\" Doctor Jones.  DONOVAN produces an ANCIENT LEATHER-BOUND VOLUME with very brittle pages. INDY views the manuscript with considerable interest.    This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two \"markers\" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those \"markers.\" It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed outit's incomplete.  Now, the second \"marker\" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.   You could be more right than you know.   We've hit a snag. our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.     We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.     Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.    I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.   Doctor Jones. Good luck. Be very careful. Don't trust anvbody.    Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?  DONOVAN smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary.    Doctor Schneider There're pages torn out of thisl  ELSA rushes to DONOVAN's side. she takes the Grail Diary from him. Elsa takes a look for herselfthen glances up at Indy.    Where are these missing pages? This maps we must have these pages backs  HENRY gives INDY a look of surprise. Indy smirks.   He sticks out like a sore thumb. We'll find him.   Take this Diary to the Reich Museum in Berlin. It will show them our progress, ahead of schedule. Without a map, I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.  He hands her the Grail Diary.       (to VOGEL, with a      helpless shrug Always do what the doctor orders.  DONOVAN leads VOGEL out. The NAZI GUARDS follow. Once they are gone, ELSA turns to INDY.   Well, we have Marcus Brody. But more important, we have the map.  A RADIO OPERATOR steps forward with yet another written message for      \"By the personal command of the Fuhrer. Secrecy essential to success. Eliminate the American conspirators.\"  Germany has declared war on the Jones boys.  Los fahren.  The car drives off.   These pages are taken from Professor Jones' diary, Your Highness. And they include a map that pinpoints the exact location of the Grail.  DONOVAN and the SULTAN walk together through an archway.   As you can see, the Grail is all but in our hands.  However, Your Highness, we would not think of crossing your soil without your permission, nor of removing the Grail from your borders without suitable compensation.    Precious valuables, Your Highness, \"donated\" by some of the finest families in all of Germany.  The SULTAN gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk. He goes right past it and begins to inspect the Nazi staff car parked nearby.    The keys are in the ignition, Your Highness.   You're welcome.  Somebody else is also taking note...and we see that it is KAZIM, the spy at the court.  ELSA is revealed coming down the stairs toward DONOVAN and VOGEL.   Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?     Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.   Maybe it wasn't even Jones.    Put Brody in the tank.  KAZIM peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group below.    Well, in this sun, without transportation, they're as good as dead.  BULLETS EXPLODE off the vehicles and cliff. DONOVAN and ELSA duck.  A NAZI SOLDIER falls from the tank as BULLETS EXPLODE around him.  KAZIM'S MEN, BRETHREN OF THE CRUCIFORM SWORD, continue to FIRE. ELSA and DONOVAN take cover beside the parked car.   It's Jones, all right.     They look down at KAZIM who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet. ELSA looks saddened.    Who is he?   Colonel? Jones is getting away.   Not that Jonesthe other Jones!   The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.  Now ELSA peers through the binoculars.     watch him from a safe distance.    She looks at him, horrified.    Helmut, another volunteer!  TWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Suddenly...   The SOUND OF RIFLE BOLTS being cocked. Everyone turns to discover INDY and his party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. Indy's group are relieved of their guns.    Step back now, Doctor Schneider. Give Doctor Jones some room. He's going to recover the Grail for us.     Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?    Nazis?!Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.       (he draws his        pistol The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.   You know something, Doctor Jones?... you're absolutely right.  Then DONOVAN shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS HENRY. The bullet enters his side below the ribs.    Get back!  HENRY collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. BRODY and SALLAH rush to his assistance.     You can't save him when you're dead.  INDY hesitates.   The healing power of the Grail is the only thing that can save your father now. It's time to ask yourself what you believe.  INDY takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of him. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. We get silent reaction shotsELSASALLAHBRODYDONOVANregistering their different emotions  INDY proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary.     We're through!  BRODY and SALLAH smile, relieved.   Which one is it?     I'm not a historian. I have no idea what it looks like. Which one is it?   Thank you, Doctor.  ELSA and INDY exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors.  ELSA chooses a cupa solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet.  DONOVAN instantly takes it from her.   Oh, yes. It's more beautiful than I'd ever imagined. This certainly is the cup of the King of Kings.  DONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.   Eternal life!  DONOVAN drinks from the goblet.  Then, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse. His face contorts in agony. He grabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA.   What . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . . me. . .?  He starts to agefast! His hair grows long and gray and brittle. His face sinks. Fingernails curl back on themselves. Milky cataracts coat his eyes.  ELSA gasps and screams.   What. . . is . . . happening. . . ?  His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits. His skeletal hands reach for ELSA's throat, choking her.",
        "Fedora": "Alfred, did you get anything yet?   Dig with your hands.  INDY picks up the Cross.    Not with your mouth.

He turns and discovers that the caboose door is open. He rushes out onto the balcony and sees:  INDY RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses.    Damn.

        "Indy": "Shhhl  FEDORA blows dust from the Cross, turning it in his hand, silently appraising its beauty... and its value. He seems aloof from the others; somehow superior to them.     That Cross is an important artifact. It belongs in a museum.  A look of resolve comes into INDY's expression, and he turns back toward  Run back and find the others. Tell Mister Havelock that there are men looting in the caves.  HERMAN doesn't seem to be listening. Instead, he watches in wide-eyed horror as a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP.

Did you hear what I said?   I don't know... I'll think of something.  INDY releases the scarf, gives HERMAN a pat and Herman dashes off. Indy sees the Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As the Robbers continue to search for additional valuables, Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of the Cross...  FEDORA looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.   Mister Havelock! Anybody Everybody's lost but me!  He hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. ROUGH RIDER, HALFBREED, and ROSCOE are quick to appear and run after him.   Hyahl Hyah!    Oh...  INDY jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into the SNAKE VAT.   Oh... Oh...  Hundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. INDY sinks into them. They cover him. Engulf him. Almost smother him.  INDY jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself.  INDY locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape.  HALFBREED, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the car. He groans. ROUGH RIDER moves to assist him.   Holy smokes!  Ohhh!   It belongs to Coronado.   This should be in a museum.   Magic?  He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping inside.  FEDORA puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to follow INDY.   Dad!   Dad!   Dad!   Dad!   It's important!   No, Dad. You listen to me   One, two, three, four...  Now we see what HENRY is concentrating on. We see his hand sketching; then, he holds up one finger.     Just the man I want to see! Now, there were five or six of them.      Well, yes, sir. It's right here!  INDY shows the CROSS, more or less handing it to the SHERIFF to make his point. The Sheriff takes it casually.   Too small for two of us.  THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT  removes the CROSS OF CORONADO from Indy's belt.   That belongs in a museum   in the water amid the debris, holding the Cross in his hand. He grabs for something to keep him afloat. It turns out to be one of the ship's LIFE PRESERVERS. INDY loops his arm through the preserver.    Archaeology is...    ... the search for fact. Not truth. If it's truth you're interested in, Doctor Tyree's Philosophy class is right down the hall.  Laughter.   So forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel, and digging up the world. Eve do not follow maps to buried treasure and \"X\" never, ever, marks the spot.   MARCUS BRODY approaches Indy's classroom. He peers through the window in the door to see INDY completing his lecture.   Seventy percent of all archaeology is done in the library. Research. Reading.    We cannot afford to take mythology at face value.  The BELL RINGS. INDY stands at his desk as students begin to disperse. A pretty coed puts a note on the desk.   Next week: \"Egyptology.\" Starting with the excavation of Naukratis by Blinders Petrie in 1885. I will be in my office if anybody's got any problems for the next hour and a half.  BRODY approaches as the last of the students leaves the lecture hall.   Marcus!  I did it!   You know how long I've been looking for that?!   All my life!    We can discuss my honorarium over dinner and champagne tonight.  He turns back toward BRODY, now holding the Cross.   Your treat.    Bursting with STUDENTS, all competing for his attention at once: \"Professor Jones! \" \"Doctor Jonesl \" etc., etc.   Shush! Shush! Shushl  INDY shoulders his way to the desk of his secretary, an overwhelmed Teaching Assistant named IRENE.    Okay. Irene, put everyone's name on a list, in the order they arrived, and I'll see each and every one of them in turn.  The Students descend upon poor IRENE, each claiming to be first. INDY slips into his -    \"Venice, Italy.\"  Then, INDY stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to the WINDOW, slides it open and STEPS OUT INTO THE GARDEN.    I know who you are Mr. Donovan.

I've heard this bedtime story before.   An old man's dream.   Grail lore is his hobby. He's a teacher of Medieval Literature. The one the students hope they don't get.  The door opens and MRS. DONOVAN steps into the room. She's a matronly woman in an expensive evening gown.   What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.   I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to ato a Franciscan friar, I think.   That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.   Yes?   You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?                     Dad?  He's an academic A bookworm. He's not a field mans  He pushes open the door. He enters the house and calls out.   Dad? Dad? INDY opens one half of the curtains dividing the hall from the sitting room.  We see the place has been ransacked.    I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!  BRODY picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk.   Dad?   Mail! That's it, Marcus!   Venice, Italy!   It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?    Do you believe, Marcus?  As INDY asks the question, he turns to a PAINTING on the wall: A depiction of Christ on the Cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice.  A SECOND PAINTING on the wall shows Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting to their deaths over a high cliff. One Crusader, however, floats safely in midair because he holds the Grail in his hands.   Do you believe the Grail actually exists?   Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.    Ah, Venice...   I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.    Yes?   And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.   Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!  INDY can't take his eyes off ELSA. Perhaps he's feeling a bit like a schoolboy himself right now. As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal, Indy steals a flower from a street vendor. He holds it out to Elsa.   Frauleinwill you permit me?   I usually don't either.   It would make me very happy.   Tomorrow I'll steal you another.   Roman numerals.    That doesn't look much like a library.   MarcusI've seen this window before.   Right here. In Dad's Diary. You see?  BRODY glances at the Diary, then at the windownoticing that the Roman numerals in question have been worked into the window's design.   Dad was onto something here!    My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.   Dad wasn't looking for a book about the Knight's Tomb... he was looking for the Tomb itself  ELSA wears a blank expression.   Don't you get it? The Tomb is somewhere in the library! You said yourself it used to be a church! Look.  INDY's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns.   Three.  INDY looks again to the stained-glass window. He points.   Three!  INDY has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral. Indy hurries away toward Column VII. All BRODY and ELSA can do now is try to keep up with him.   Seven.  He points again to the stained-glass window.   Seven... Ten.  He looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands.   And ten. Now where's the ten? Look around for the ten.  INDY walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, then looks down.    Three, seven and ten.  He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a LOFT and looks down at BRODY and ELSA. The floor beneath their feet is an elaborate tile design containing a huge \"X\"visible only from this higher angle.   Ten.  \"X\" marks the spot.  INDY rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE where the two sides of the X intersect. He blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up, but cannot.  INDY rushes past BRODY to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath the stained-glass window.  INDY raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian regards the stamper curiously.  INDY continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes his stamping, still puzzled by the SOUND ECHOING through the library.  Finally INDY breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a  Bingo.   Except he's lost, and I'm not.   Look after this for me, will you?  Then INDY disappears into the hole.   Come on.  INDY and ELSA glance around. This is really a horrid place. Dark and dank. foul smelling. Elsa turns. She removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory four-leaf clover design.  INDY and ELSA inspect markings carved onto the walls.   Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.   That's right. If there's a Knight of the First Crusade entombed down here, that's where we'll find him.    The Ark of the Covenant.    Pretty sure.  INDY holds the lighter up and he and ELSA enter another dark passageway.   Watch out.  ELSA now holds the lighter as INDY rams his shoulder into the wall. The wall collapses on impact and Indy falls through into another room.    Petroleum. I could sink a well down here and retire.  INDY reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick water.  INDY uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then dips into the oily water.   Give me the lighter.   Oh, rats...  ELSA gasps as the rats scamper between her legs.  INDY moves forward through the rat-infested water as ELSA follows, still gasping in horror. Suddenly he slips into a hole. Recovering his balance, he reaches out to Elsa.   Come onl  She gasps once again, terrified. INDY lifts her and carries ELSA as he moves forward.    Come here.   Look. . .  In the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is what amounts to an \"island altar\" on which SEVERAL ANCIENT COFFINS rest. They move toward the altar.    It must be one of these...   This is itl we found it! Look the engraving on the Shield. It's the same as on the Grail Tablets The Shield is the Second Marker!  INDY unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield.   It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.  The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield.    He never would have made it past the rats!  He hates rats!  He's scared to death of them!    ELSA holds the torch. INDY looks around. Listens. Something is wrong. And then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing across the Catacomb walls.  This is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around the corner of the Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward ELSA and INDYSHRIEKING and SQUEALING as they approach.  The rats literally wash over themlike a rodent tidal wavein their efforts to escape a:   Get back! Back against the wall.  INDY braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN with his feet. It CRASHES against the stone platform and SPLASHES into the water.   Quick! Under it!  They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin.   Air pocket!  ELSA hesitates. INDY literally DUNKS her and pushes her underneath.    Don't wander off.    I think I've found a way out. Deep breath.  ELSA groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water.     Ah, Venicel  Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since KAZIM and TWO OTHER TURKISH AGENTS are running towards them with drawn guns.  He grabs ELSA by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and LEAP   Are you crazy?! You don't go between them!  ELSA can barely hear INDY over the noise of the motor.   I said go around!   I said don't go between them!  It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the the two Freighters loom up on either side of them like cavern walls.     spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT appear racing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, FIRING A MACHINE GUN at INDY and ELSA.    Why are you trying to kill us?   My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?   Where is he? Talkor you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!   Then we'll die.   This is your last chance.   All right! Where's my father   Who are you?   And why were you trying to kill me?   I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.   How's the head?   The Knights of the First Crusade laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year. The entire city was destroyed.  BRODY lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at INDY.   The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus you remember what the Grail Tablet said. \"Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon.\"  But where exactly?     Alexandretta. Now we know.    Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.  INDY closes the Grail Diary and puts it into the pocket of his robe.   I'm going after Dad.     INDY opens the door. His bedroom has been ransacked...the mattress on the floor, the drawers turned out.   Elsa?  He goes in.    Elsa?  He steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door.   Elsa?  He opens the bathroom door, peering inside.   Elsa?    Mine, too.   This.    Uh-huh.   I didn't know you.  She's awfully hard to resist.   At least I let you tag along.   Knock it off. You're not mad.   No. You like the way I do things.   Look, what do you think is going on here? Since I've met you, I've nearly been incinerated, drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait. We're caught in the middle of something sinister here. My guess is Dad found out more than he was looking for. And until I'm sure, I'm going to continue to do things the way I think they should be done.    Leave me alone. I don't like fast women.  But he embraces her, and ELSA begins to nibble at his ear.    INDY lies on top of ELSA, kissing her. He stops for a moment as he hears the  Ahh, Venice.  ELSA reaches up and pulls him back down to her.    What do you know about this place?   Don't know. Think of something.  He glances up to the beret ELSA is wearing. She reaches up and adjusts it.    And not before time! Did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day? We're drenched!  As INDY says this he pushes his way past the startled BUTLER, pulling a handkerchief from the man's pocket. ELSA follows, taking off her coat. INDY  Now look! I've gone and caught a sniffle.  INDY dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as ELSA looks on in amused amazement.   Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.      Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?   How dare he?!  Simultaneously knocking the BUTLER cold with one slug on the jaw. The Butler falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, out cold.     Nazis. I hate these guys.  INDY and ELSA continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun in his hand and his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens.   This one. I think he's in here.   Because it's wired.  He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter one of the other doors. He knocks at the doorthere is no response. He looks back at ELSA and enters.   Don't worry... this is kid's play. I'll be right back.  He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude from the castle wall above the next window.  He gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will hold his weight.     Yes, sirl        (an old familiar       irritation Don't call me that, please.   I came to get you! What do you think?  NAZI VOICES ARE HEARD approaching. INDY and HENRY press themselves against the wall, Henry still holding the broken vase in his hand.  INDY steps to the window and looks down. HENRY moves to a lamp, holding the vase under the light for a closer look.    And the head.  You hit me, Dad!          (surprised,         misunderstanding Don't worryI'm fine.   No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.   Dad, they come in through the doors.   I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.   Right.   Found it.   Well, what was left of him.   Alexandretta.   It's a great moment in HENRY's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to INDY with joy.   No, Dad. You did. Forty years.   There were rats, Dad.   Yeah. big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?    Yeah?  INDY's interest is a moment which becomes important later but for now it passes.    Yeah. . .  Then... BAMI The door is kicked open and three NAZIS enter. One is an S.S. OFFICER. The other two are SOLDIERS with machine guns. HENRY and INDY raise their hands.    What book?   Well, uh...   Look, can we discuss this later?    Will you take it easy....!   I came here to save you.   I told you--  He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three NAZIS to ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room.   --don't call me Junior!  HENRY looks shocked and horrified.   Elsa? Elsa?  He opens a door and enters:   What?!  INDY  is thrown. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at ELSA, then back to his father. Everyone is yelling at once:   No! Don't Shoot!    Wait!  Waitl  And then Indy gives in. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides across, SHATTERING GLASS. HENRY GROANS audibly.  VOGEL releases his grip on ELSA and shoves her toward INDY. She is propelled directly into his arms. He holds her tightly. She buries her face in his chest.   No, don't be.  Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary.    She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?   How did you she was a Nazi?   Donovan   So it did.    The hell you will. He's got a two-day head-start on you, which is more than he needs.  Brody's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan. He speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom. He'll blend in. Disappear. You'll never see him again. With any luck, he's got the Grail already.  HENRY looks amazed and impressed.   I'm sorry you think so.  She runs her hand down the side of his face. INDY pulls away.  INDY and HENRY are still tied back-to-back of course. ELSA bends to speak quietly into INDY's ear... which is near enough to Henry's ear.    Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.   Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!   Are you kidding?I made that up! You know Marcushe got lost once in his own museum!  Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency.   Can you try and reach into my left jacket pocket?  HENRY is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket. INDY squirms his body around towards Henry's hand.   My lucky charm.   Try and burn through the ropes.  HENRY's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame.   Don't get sentimental now Dad save it 'til we get out of here.    What???   All right, movel Move!  Rock your Chair.  Do what I do.  They begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off the burning carpet.    Dad!   Dad!   Dad!  Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.   Head for the fireplace!   I think I can get these ropes off.  Indy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal grill that operates a Secret Door.   Whoopsl  The fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and his father find themselves in the:    Listen Dad... I'm almost free.  INDY's foot hits the grill again... and the fireplace rotates to:    I'm out, Dad!   INDY finally breaks free. And he immediately begins to untie his father.    The RADIOMEN move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one hand, holding their guns with the other. Is it possible that INDY and HENRY escaped through these flames?  Not a chance.  They've hidden themselves UP THE CHIMNEY. And now they DROP DOWN, BEHIND the RADIOMEN.  One of the RADIOMEN grabs INDY by the neck. As they struggle they fall against the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened HENRY behind.  HENRY presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he disappears into the next room, a DEAD NAZI RADIOMAN swivels into the room. The other NAZIS rush forward to him.   Come on Dad.   Dead end.  HENRY looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as INDY searches frantically for an exit.   There's got to be a... a secret door around. A passageway or something.  INDY begins to run his hands over the wallsfrantic.   Dad!   Great. More boats.     Ooofl No! It's been better than most.  INDY moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away. HENRY looks confused.   Come on, Dad. Come onl   Ha!    INDY grabs at a FLAGPOLE as they roar pastit snaps off in his hand.  The NAZI SOLDIER drives his motorcycle toward INDY and HENRY. He unshoulders his machine gun.  INDY uses the broken flagpole as a lance and knocks the NAZI SOLDIER from his motorcycle.    As the remaining NAZI SOLDIER rides alongside their motorbike he cocks his gun, preparing to fire.  INDY quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole through the spokes of the Nazi's front wheel.  The NAZI SOLDIER'S MOTORCYCLE FLIPS THREE TIMES, throwing him high into the air.    What?        (pointing towards       Venedig Brody's this way.   You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.   All right Dadtell me.   What final challenge?   Booby traps?    But what are they? Can't you remember?   Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?   What about Marcus?   Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christl  HENRY slaps him across the face. INDY is rocked to his foundations, not by any means entirely by the blow itself.   This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.   Fraulein Doctor. Where is it?  Still startled, her reaction makes it clear that Indy is even now a lover in her thoughts.   Where is it? I want it.  INDY pushes ELSA against a column and begins to search her clothing for the Diary. He pulls the book from Elsa's pocket.    My father didn't want it incinerated.  She understands him. It's as though he slapped her.    Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands forwho gives a damn what you think?    All I have to do is squeeze.   I've got it. Let's get the hell out of here.  They move off and almost run headlong into HITLER and his entire entourage coming down from the Podium. 50 kids push their autograph books for Hitler's signature.  HITLER pauses to sign them. Hitler looks Indy's way. They make eye contact. It only lasts a moment but the moment is electric.  HITLER breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, opens it to the first page and signs his autograph. He hands it back and moves on.   I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.   Well, we made it.  HENRY looks over his newspaper at INDY.   Relax.  But INDY looks out the window and is suddenly concerned when he sees:   sits back in his chair, looks to HENRY, now reading his newspaper.  A STEWARD enters and sets a bowl of nuts on the table in front of INDY and HENRY, then continues down the aisle of passengers. Indy follows after the Steward. He puts his arm around the Steward's shoulder and together they walk up a flight of stairs.   Fahrscheine, bitte.     Tickets please.  The Passengers do not react to the request, made in English.   Fahrscheine meine Dame. Bitte.   Fahrscheine meine Herr.   Tickets please.  HENRY looks confused.        (in German; with a       shrug No ticket.  Everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy's face.     That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa---er, her grandfather!   I was the next man.   Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.   We didn't talk. We never talked.   A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.   When?   HENRY looks up from his Diary.   What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.   Dad, how can you --?    Well... I can't think of anything.   What does that mean?   They're turning around. They're taking us back to Germany.    Well, I thought it would take them a lot longer to figure out the radio was dead. Come on, Dad. Move!  Then INDY opens the doors. We see plenty of blue sky and white clouds. We also see a small BIPLANE that is suspended from the Zeppelin by a HOOK &amp; CRANE  Come on, Dad. Come on!   Fly--yes. Land--no.     shrink in their seats as the MESSERSCHMIDTS (going three times as fast as they are) SCREAM past on either side.   Dad, you're gonna have to use the machine gun. Get it ready.  HENRY turns and grips the MOUNTED MACHINE GUN with a perplexed expression.    Eleven o'clock!  HENRY pulls out his watch.   Dadeleven o'clock!!    Twelveeleventen. Eleven o'clock. Fire!  HENRY doesand the EXPLODING GUN nearly shakes him out of his seat.  Indy's slow speed and small size works to his advantage. The speeding Messerschmidts continually overshoot him, WHIZZING past in a blurmaking wide turns miles away in the sky.  HENRY has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls back on the trigger  Dad, are we hit?!   Hang on, Dads We're going in!  HENRY slumps down fearfully in his seat.    Thanks.   Suddenly, INDY's attention is directed to:    I know, Dadl   It happens to me all the time.    This could be close.    Dad, he's coming back.  INDY and HENRY run down the mountainside to:     exchange a wordless glance. They don't even think about running: there is no place to run to. HENRY hands his case to INDY.  Holding his umbrella, HENRY suddenly spins around and runs screaming and shouting into A FLOCK OF SEA GULLS...  THE SEA GULLS take to the wing in flight. Thousands of them.    Bullets kick up sand leading up to him... then  THE MESSERSCHMIDT AND THE SEA GULLS meet in midair. MASSACRE! Sea gulls are shredded by the Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a FEATHERY WHITE PUREE that SPLATTERS against the cockpit and CLOGS THE  What happened to Marcus, Sallah?   Ah, I see Brody. He seems okay. They've got a tank. Six-pound gun.  Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills.  What he sees is:      Dad, we're well out of range.  At that moment the tank FIRES A SHELL in their direction.  It WHISTLES overhead and BLOWS UP THE PARKED CAR. INDY, HENRY and SALLAH cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them.         (gesturing to the        others Come on--come on!     INDY and HENRY, followed by SALLAH, take cover behind a rock to watch Kazim's Men and the Nazi Troops exchanging fire below them.   Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.  CUT BACK to the action. The BRETHREN are firing at the DONOVAN party and are being fired on by the Donovan party.  TWO NAZI SOLDIERS throw HAND GRENADES into the cliffs. They EXPLODE, killing one of Kazim's Brethren.  The battle continuesa fierce exchange of GUNSHOTS, GRENADES and MACHINE GUN FIRE with losses on both sides.    crouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the battle run amongst camels and horses.   I'm going after those horses.   I don't need camels.   No camels!     leaps atop a TURKISH SOLDIER on horseback, pulling the man and the horse to the ground. A SECOND TURK comes to assist his comrade; INDY mounts the horse, knocking both Turks to the ground.    Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?   Where's my father?    Cleverly, INDY has turned the tank directly into a head-on collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a Kubelwagon.  The tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German military sedan becoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of the six-pound cannon on the turret.  INDY, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone from the wall of a culvert. He reigns his horse, paralleling the tank, as everyone scurries about inside, looking through viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where Indy is.    Dad!  Dad!  Dad!     Hate-staring back at VOGEL.  Suddenly, from nowhere a German soldier flies INTO FRAME, tackling Indy.   Dad!  He drops the gun down into the tank.   Dad! Dadl Get it!  VOGEL pulls INDY from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain wrapped around his neck.    Dad?   Get out of there, Dad!  INDY pulls HENRY and BRODY from the tank. VOGEL pulls himself back atop the tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs Vogel's arm.   Dad!  HENRY is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll. INDY struggles to hold onto the end of the bullwhip.   Hang on, Dad!  SALLAH draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez to HENEY.   Sallah! Get Dadl  SALLAH reaches out to HENRY.    looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror.  We SEE his HAT BLOW OFF and sail over the cliff's edge.   I thought you had too, sir.  BRODY and SALLAH are moved by this sudden reconciliation.    react to the sight.    I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.   As what? A Nazi stooge like you?   Shooting me won't get you anywhere.   Dad?!   \"The Breath of God... Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass. . . \"  INDY takes a few steps forward.   \"The penitent man will pass. The penitent man...\"  INDY stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died.  HENRY looks at INDY. Indy looks at Henry.    The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...   The penitent man is humble before God.   The penitent man is humble...  The cobwebs begin to move....   He kneels before God.  Kneel!!  We hear the awful rush of airWHOOSH! Because INDY is in the act of kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face.  Instinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's way and looks up. From his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR  I'm through!     holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs.    \"The second challenge is the  Word of God. Only in the footsteps of God will he proceed.\"  The Word of God... The Word of...   INDY pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. Each cobble is engraved with a letter.   \"Proceed in the footsteps of the Word.\"      as he studies the cobblestones before him.    The Name of God... Jehovahl          who grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, the v-rail Diary in his hand.   In Latin, \"Jehovah\" starts with an \"I.\" \"I\"...  Now we SEE each letter on the stones as INDY carefully walks forward. DONOVAN and ELSA follow in his footsteps.     He can see nowhere to cross. He looks again to the v-rail Diary.   \"The path of flood. Only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth.\"  INDY looks around and then he notices that inscribed into the rock above his head is the head of a lion.   Impossiblel Nobody can jump this!  INDY looks down into the Diary and tortures over what it is asking him to do.       It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.   Who are you?   That was seven hundred years ago.   I'm not exactly...a knight. What do you mean?    Listen, I don't have time to explain, but  At that moment DONOVAN and ELSA appear. Donovan turns to face the display of cups.   That's the cup of a carpenter.  He and ELSA exchange a look.   There's only one way to find out.  INDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses. INDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows.  A strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we see his wounds begin to heal.    Dad, come on. Get to your feet.   Elsa! Elsa, don't movel   Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.  A RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD and the ground roars and shifts. Dirt falls from the ceiling of the cavern. ELSA falls on the Great Seal. The Grail bounces away from her grasp. She reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT OPEN. ELSA slips into the crevasse. She screams.  ELSA is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost within her reach. As her hands lose their grip, INDY just manages to one of them, he himself sliding forward across the slanted floor.   Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.     Elsa! Give me your hand. Give me your other hand!  ELSA just manages to touch the Grail. In doing so, she has tipped the balance too farINDY slides down another yard, Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to her death.    Elsa!!  Now the ledge INDY lies upon begins to break apart. HENRY grabs one of his hands as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with the other.   I can get itI can almost reach it, Dad.  INDY looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him from which nothing can ever be retrieved.   Dad. . .  The GRAIL KNIGHT raises his arm to HENRY.    Please, Dad...  INDY and HENRY down the passageway just as a huge stone column tumbles down upon the spot where they stood. The GRAIL KNIGHT lowers his arm as he watches them leave.    What did vou find, Dad?   Junior?! Dad...    I like Indiana.    I've got a lot of fond memories of that dog.  A moment passes as they all ready their mounts and SALLAH continues to laugh at INDY.   Ready?   Uh-huh.    Yes, sir!  Haaa!"

    "description": "An art collector appeals to Indiana Jones to embark on a search for the Holy Grail. He learns that another archaeologist has disappeared while searching for the precious goblet, and the missing man is his own father, Dr. Henry Jones. The artifact is much harder to find than they expected, and its powers are too much for those impure of heart.—Jwelch5742",
