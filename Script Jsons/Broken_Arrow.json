        "Hale": "Hell, I barely know what day it is.  The fact that I can't feel the left side of my face -- that's okay, right? Deakins laughs. Hale seizes the relaxed moment and suddenly launches into Deakins with a flurry of punches.  He cocks his arm back. He could finish Deakins off. But he doesn't. He drops his fist.  Now Deakins has the upperhand. He backs Hale around the ring.    Lands, dazed, blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth.  Looks up at Deakins, catches his breath.      Deakins offers his hand. Hale pushes it aside. Deakins ignores Hale, grabs him and helps him to his feet. Deakins climbs out of the ring between the ropes. Hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over, landing on his feet. Deakins gives Hale a look, laughs, shakes his head.  Is in sunlight. On the inside of his locker door are pictures of exotic planes -- the SR-71, a swept-wing fighter, an artist's rendition of the Aurora, etc.  Here.  Slams a twenty dollar bill down on the bench.  Oh, shut up.  Jerk.  Because you've been boxing for twenty years and you're much better at it than I am?  We were just sparring.  I think I saw that on a T-shirt. Deakins pulls out the twenty dollar bill; hands it back to Hale.  No, that's yours.  No, I mean -- that's yours, literally. I took it out of your wallet when you were in the shower. Deakins laughs, puts the money away.  General.      The usual ...?  '61s?  Ooh. Crowpleasers.  Enter and walk under the plane, nodding to the ground crew. Hale and Deakins are royalty. Deakins and Hale climb up the airplane's Crew Entry steps and disappear.  You know, these exercises are fantastic. I mean, when that day comes and we finally go to war against Utah, we are really going to kick ass.  Yeah. Turns out he wants people with more fighter hours.  What could I say?  Yeah, well you know what your problem is?  You fight too much.  Right? You said it yourself -- you should be at least Wing Commander by now. Maybe you would be if you didn't insist on telling people what they're doing wrong all the time.  Tell Colonel Wilkins I could fly this puppy up his ass without him knowing.  On your word.  Airspeed lock at point-seven Mach. Blue line descent on throttle to 400 feet AGL. Hale pulls back on the throttle. The plane descends.  Time to limbo down. How low can we go.      I tell people I became a pilot because I wanted to fly cool planes. It's also for this. When we're up here, I feel... closer ... I don't know.  Looking out the window. There's some movement in the reflection in the glass. QUICK PULL FOCUS to see, distorted in the curve of the window, Deakins reaching inside his flight suit.      Turns his head back toward Deakins.  Deak, you can't smoke in here -- But then Hale sees it's not a cigarette that Deakins is pulling out of his flight suit. It's shiny, metal. It's...  Grabs Deakins' hand, pushing up as...  The bullet cuts a line through the top of his helmet, punching a hole in the window by his head.  Deakins goes for another shot, but Hale grabs the gun and pushes up, sending bullets through the ceiling of the plane, into the walls. Deakins forces the gun down, fires.  Hale brings Deakins' gun hand hard against Hale's own helmet. Deakins yowls and the gun goes flying. Then Hale sees something.  Sees it, yanks on the stick.  No! He pulls at Deakins' arms.  Deakins hits Hale with the back of his hand, knocking him back. Hale grabs Deakins' helmet, yanks it off his head and smashes Deakins back with it. Hale keys the armament buttons.  Deakins grabs a fire extinguisher, swings it, getting Hale in the face. Hale is almost knocked out, blood running from his nose.  Hale tries to push the handle down as Deakins pulls it up as...  His head snaps back as Deakins pulls.  Pop, hiss like a huge vacuum-sealed can is being opened.  As he rockets up out of the cockpit.  When the chute opens, he almost spills out because of the severed shoulder harness. He grabs the straps, holds on.      Spins, grabs the shirt of the figure and cocks his arm about to punch. He hesitates when he sees it's...      Hale is stunned. Terry starts to get up, reaching for her gun. Hale strikes out with a leg, getting Terry in the gut, sending her back. She hits the ground, still struggling for her gun. Hale gets up, runs, sprinting off over the rocky terrain.  Pulls up fast, almost not fast enough.  He's stopped right at the edge of a fifty foot drop.     I'm going to tell you something I can't tell you. Terry puts away her gun, spins Hale around and starts marching him off.  There were nuclear weapons on that plane. The guy I was flying with is trying to steal them. Terry reacts to that, but keeps Hale moving.      I have to stop him, and I need your help.  I only ran because you punched me.  He has men on the ground. I --  Jumps up and through the handcuffs.  Grabs it from her, puts it to-her head, but not before...  Don't move. A beat while they catch their breath.  This isn't a stand-off, okay? I've got a gun.  Terry holds out her hand. Hale lets the revolver swing down on his finger. Just as Terry takes it...  Moves fast, grabs Terry's knife hand, then kicks her legs out from under her. Hale lands on top of her, still holding her knife hand, putting the knife to her throat.  I'm telling you the truth.  I could kill you now. Right? Terry nods, bewildered and more than a little scared. Hale lets go of Terry's hand holding the knife.  I need your help. Terry looks at Hale for a long moment. She's still holding the knife. She exhales, then sticks the knife in the dirt.   Deakins'll be monitoring any radio transmissions out of here.  That's what I'd do.  (a flash of the horrible betrayal he  I don't have any choice. The nukes are my responsibility. Besides... (pulls something from  The last thing in the world he expects is for me to come after him. Hale walks off into the light of the rising sun. Terry looks at the $20 bill.  Yeah. Less constricting.  Don't walk where?  That's a new one. Endangered dirt. Terry gives Hale a look.      What's your dog's name?  No dog.      Terry jumps on the brakes. She and Hale bail out as...  Sprint up the trail.  We've gotta hide!  Hide where?  Looks at the helicopter as the bullets whistle in. When he turns back, Terry's gone.  What the --?  Arms flailing, drops fifteen feet, to deep sand.  How do you --?  Terry is trying to get her eyes to focus.  Hale is helping Terry to her feet as BOOM -- the first grenade goes off. They run.  Can you climb up?  Give me your gun.      Is down in the fissure, pointing the revolver straight up at the helicopter hovering right overhead, figuring out where to shoot.  Blackhawk ... Moved pilot seat back a foot ... Puts him right about ... here. Hale hesitates -- he's never shot at someone before -- then takes a breath and starts shooting.  Is surprised -- it worked!'  Hale runs up, grabs Terry, pulls her to her feet as...  Run clear.  How do they get out of here?  Deak'd have a back-up. He'd be prepared.  He wouldn't want to go towards town.  See the one in front? It just has a driver? They wanted to keep the weight down. It has the nukes. Hale takes Terry's gun from her.  Humvees can reseal and inflate with the flick of a switch. That's why Deak chose 'em. Terry looks at Hale -- then what is he going to do?  I'm gonna steal it.  You get to a phone and call McMurran.  Then you better start walking.   I appreciate what you've done so far. But now it gets hairy. Go to the phone. He scrambles off over the rock.  Jump down onto the roof of the lead Humvee. Hale looks at Terry, angry. But before he can say anything...      Bullets punch up. Hale pulls out the gun. It falls from his hand. Terry grabs it as a sharp swerve sends...  Flying. He lands hard behind the Humvee.  Sprints after the leading Humvee. Deakins' Humvee closes fast.  Grabs the gun out of the air as...  Is going to be crushed between the Humvees. He jumps up, turning, as the bumpers come together. He lands on the tailgate facing backwards and fires into Deakins' windshield.  Is behind him. Hale gets into the passenger seat.  Gimme the gun and get out.  No, we don't. Hale shoots Baker in the thigh. Baker howls.  Kicks Baker out of the Humvee.  Holds the steering wheel, yells to Terry.  You drive!  I'd yell at you for coming after me, but you did just save my life.     There's a look between them, then Hale climbs into the back. He finds what he is looking for -- a jerry can of gasoline and an emergency tool box.  Hale keeps his back to the other Humves. He pulls gaffer's tape off a roll, tears it with his teeth, grabs...  Hale climbs up into the front seat. Terry looks at him, genuinely impressed.  We need somewhere to hide.  They hardwired in their frequency. We can't call out.  I'm gonna take away Deakins' reason for being here. Hale grabs a screwdriver from the tool kit and pries open a panel on the side of one of the B-83s.      They're designed to be used by guys wearing gloves in Alaska. He reaches in, hits a key and the LCD display lights up.  These nukes have security codes. If you enter the wrong code three times, the nuke goes dead -- all the circuitry shorts out and shuts down. Kind of like the security systems with car radios.     Pulls it out, looks at it.  Hale turns to Terry as she pulls over the radio mike.  Where's St. Judes Hospital?  Deak -- you there?     Deakins and Kelly look at each other.  Ding, ding, ding, Deak. We're starting a new round. You took the first couple, but I've got you on the ropes now, you son of bitch. Deakins gets in the passenger side, grabs the radio mike.  Kelly drives Deakins' Humvee along the trail as they talk.  I know you're stalling while you try to find the nukes with your scanner, but you're gonna be too late. Hear that? Hale holds the radio mike up to the keypad as he enters numbers.  I'm entering the wrong code, you bastard. A couple more times and these are gonna be useless to you.  Because I would've said no?  You better hope that's true, Doak. Because I've got the nukes, and there's nothing to stop me from entering the right code, if you know what I mean.  Nah. You're right. I wouldn't have the guts. END SPLIT-SCREEN. Hale drops the mike; looks at the elevator.  How deep is this mine?  That's deep enough. Hale opens the elevator gate.  A nuclear explosion. Terry's jaw drops.      He's got a scanner. He'd find them.  They set them off underground in Nevada all through the fifties and sixties. There's no risk.  We won't be down there when it goes off. This isn't a suicide mission.     I need your help. Terry thinks, shakes her head, steps up and grabs the nuke.  When we get to the bottom we'll have to get away from this shaft. It'll limit the amount of radiation released into-the atmosphere.  No. I'm only going to set off one. We'll leave the other one here. It'll be buried under a billion tons of rock. They are startled when the elevator starts going up behind them  We better hurry.  Let's try down there.     They start hauling the nuke down the tunnel.  Pilots who fly with nuclear weapons have standing orders to ... (quoting from the  I'm gonna need your belt and one of your socks.  Okay. Terry lets Hale down. Hale picks up a big rock and loops the free end of the belt around it. Then he picks up a smaller rock.  We make a small hole in the sock, and when enough sand drains out -- and we're hopefully in New Mexico -- the sock is pulled through the eyebolt, the rock drops...  ... hitting the rock on this chip, closing the firing circuit and that's it. Hale finishes putting the small rock in position. He stands.  I don't know precisely. This isn't a Swiss sock. Ten minutes, maybe -- Hale is cut off by...  Dive to the ground. They pull pistols, start shooting.  Feels sand hitting his face, looks up.  Reaches up to grab the big rock, but Johnson sends a spray of bullets in. Terry grabs Hale.  The sock -- More bullets. Terry pulls Hale. They run down a side passage. Hale and Terry fire back at Johnson as they run out of sight.  Running along a tunnel.  Beat 'em back to the elevator. Stop 'em from getting out. Terry nods. They hurry off around a corner and are met by...  Run back down the side tunnel, bullets winging off the rock all around them, shooting back. Hale starts shooting out the lights, plunging the tunnel into darkness.  In the dark, waiting to ambush Deakins and then...  Suddenly exposed to Deakins' fire. The bullets whiz in.  Take cover. It's a stand-off.  You're gonna ransom Salt Lake City, aren't you? The footsteps stop.  That's where St. Judes Hospital is. You're gonna hide the nukes near the radiology department so they won't show up an any satellite radiation scans.  How much are you gonna ask for?  So that's it? You're just doing 'this for the money? I'm kind of disappointed.  That's the thing -- I wouldn't.  If I were you...?  Because ... because I got passed over for promotion and goddamnit I'm going to show the bastards that I'm smarter than them all.  Because ... everyone's selling out and cashing in, so why not me?  Because ... because my ex-wife was sleeping around. Because my parents abused me. Because I ate some sugar.          They hear footsteps, receding. Hale bolts out of their hiding spot. Terry follows.  Make a move toward the elevator, but...  Back around a corner, side by side, shooting their pistols.  Step out of the tunnel and fire on the climbing elevator.  We don't know the code, and Deak'd have it wired to blow if we so much as look at it funny.  I'm sorry. I shouldn't've let you come.  Come on. Hale pulls Terry, running, down the far tunnel.  You said they shut down the mine when they hit an underground river.  Any idea where it goes?  Dodge them, push off, duck under. And then they notice that...  Lungs bursting, they start kicking up.  Hale has his shirt off and is wringing it out.  It's okay.  I know.      That it did.  Look. (points at  Absolutely. It says so in the manual. \"If you see butterflies after a detonation, you are fine.\" Terry looks at Hale. She knows he's bullshitting her, but she appreciates it. They look at each other. They could kiss ... but they both shy away from it. Terry gets her shirt off.  We better get moving. We might be able to reach Deakins when he gets to the river. They start off along a trail by the river.  Something I've been meaning to ask.  How did someone like you end up with a gun?  Excuse me?  I'm still waiting for the chicken.    Shit.  We're the only ones who know what's going on, and I don't have the faintest idea how we're gonna stop them.  Why do you say that?  Steal it. They get down to the raft. They climb in. Hale grabs the engine throttle, slumps.  Keys. Hale looks around, spots Sheppard's duffel bag lying on the riverbank. He hops out and starts rummaging through it when they hear grunting and feet approaching. Hale looks around for a place to hide. There isn't any. Terry tries to get out of the raft, but she trips on a tarpaulin bunched on the bottom of the raft. she drops.  Is alone, in the water, on the far side of the raft, very silent. He hears Deakins and Sheppard load the nuke into the raft.  Are walking toward the second helicopter.  If we get a rad scanner we can track them. A brief look between Wilkins and Giles.  What?      I'm not wasting time answering questions. We've got --  Deakins thinks I'm dead. He thinks it's over. You've got to let me go after him. I can help. I know how his mind works.  What about the Ranger?  When you find that truck, you'll hit it hard. Chances are she'll be killed in the crossfire. \"Regrettable but unavoidable.\"     Giles and Wilkins share a look -- Hale is right.  Look, she's not supposed to be there. She should be checking camping permits, finding lost kids. She...  She saved my life. Giles wants to help. So does Wilkins, but...  If that's what it takes.   I swear to God I'll shoot. Wilkins grins.  Deak would know that. Maybe he's not on the road. Wilkins doesn't understand.  They were using maps like these to set up the roadblocks?  Then that's the answer. Wilkins doesn't understand. Hale points outside, down at...  It's an old spur. Probably hasn't been used in twenty years. Nobody bothered to put it on the new maps.  The nuke isn't in a truck, Colonel. It's on a train.  No. Go south.  He's not going to Salt Lake.  He planted that. He wanted whoever found it to think that's where he was going.  He's been doing a rope-a-dope. Giles and Wilkins look at him like he's nuts.  It's a boxing term. When Ali -- Look, I know this guy. If everything has been saying he's heading north, then he's heading south. They look at him, then Wilkins grabs the map.  No. Not Vegas. What the hell is there to blow up in Vegas? Wilkins' finger keeps moving on the map.  That's him!      Pull up!      Hanging from the helicopter on a cable hooked to a harness and he's firing a pistol, shooting right over Terry at...  As he swings in on the cable, shooting his pistol.  Are lifted up and over...      Is severed by one of Sheppard's bullets.  Drop ten feet to the roof of a boxcar. Hale shoots as they fall.  Watch the helicopter land as the train rolls on. They look at each other.  Any excitement turns to confusion when they see...      Not any more. Terry nods. They share a last look, then Terry heads off. Male coils up the winch cable, slings it over his shoulder and heads for the nuke boxcar and his old friend Deakins. He picks up...  Standing, tugging on the cable, still attached to the harness. Hale racks a load in the shotgun and jumps back off the side of the train.  Swings into the boxcar on the cable, firing the shotgun.  Shoots at Deakins, misses. The shotgun clicks empty. Hale tosses the gun then unhooks the cable from the harness. He drops to the floor-of the boxcar and runs to the ladder.  Reaches out of the hatch and grabs onto Deakins' foot.      Deakins kicks free of Hale, holds onto the man in the helicopter and is pulled onboard.  Is hanging onto the skids and he's hooked the cable to the skid. The other end of the cable is still attached to the hatch.  Who grabs onto the cable and slides down it to the roof of the train, bullets plugging in all around his. He jumps down through the hatch as...  Looks at it, trying to figure out how to disarm it. He hears the whoosh-thump of someone jumping down into the boxcar. He turns.  It's over, Deak. I beat you. Disarm it.      Deak...  Share a look. Deakins puts up his fists.  Stands over Deakins, in silhouette, the light of the hatch above him. And then...  Looks around for something. He sees it --    The nuke is armed, Deak. If it falls, the impact trigger will set it off.  Half a million people will die.  His finger hovers over the amber button.  I guess you really don't know me that well after all. Hale presses the amber button.      Spins back, blood spraying from his shoulder.  Grabs the remote and his finger presses the RED button.  Gets to his feet and stands over Deakins. He reaches down, opens Deakins' pocket and pulls out the twenty-dollar bill.  Ready. He heads out of the boxcar.  Keeps running through the wreckage. He stops, unable to breathe when he sees...  Runs to the car, pulls at the foot, tries to push the car off the body underneath. O.S. another vehicle drives up.  Come on! Oh, God. Oh, no. Hale is pulling hard on the foot when...  Run to each other. They embrace, start smoothing each other's hair, start wiping blood off each other's faces, start kissing, only to be interrupted by...  Uh... (looks at flaming  Rawley Hale.",
        "Terry": "Pretty, late 20s. Her radio squawks.   No. Why?  Oh, God. What is it this time? UFO abduction? Ritual human sacrifice?  Yes, well, this is a woman who chopped off one of her own fingers because it'd \"turned on her.\"   She was probably hallucinating, but I'll check it out.  Clyde, tell Mrs. Parker that there's nothing weird going on. No truck, no UFOs, and, except for the odd human head on a stick, no sign of Satan. She feels it before she hears it or sees it.      Holy shit.  Somebody ejected!  She seizes Hale's hesitation and punches him hard.  Hale is stunned. Terry starts to get up, reaching for her gun. Hale strikes out with a leg, getting Terry in the gut, sending her back. She hits the ground, still struggling for her gun. Hale gets up, runs, sprinting off over the rocky terrain.  That would be the wrong way.  Is walking slowly, calmy, up behind Hale, pistol out.  Turn around.   Gimme your hands. Hale sticks his hands behind him. Terry handcuffs them.     What, we're ten years old now? \"You started it. No you started it.\"  Save it. My dog's waiting for his breakfast. Terry starts to push Hale along again and...  Reaches for her revolver, but...  Whips a knife from her belt and puts it under Hale's chin.  Don't move. A beat while they catch their breath.  Yeah, well, I never keep my gun loaded. Terry taps her belt.      Terry holds out her hand. Hale lets the revolver swing down on his finger. Just as Terry takes it...  This is a good way to convince me.  I've got a radio in the truck. We can call McMurran and get the Marines in here.      Who is this guy?  Me? What are you going to do? (no answer, she  What's that? Hale sticks...  Is that the new uniform?  The dayshift guy left some work clothes in the truck. You can have them if you want. Hale nods. His feet crunch on something.  Don't walk there.  On that black stuff. That's cryptogamic soil. It's very fragile. One footprint takes centuries to repair.     Bear. I was going to call him Death, so I could say things like, \"I walk with Death,\" and \"Death chewed my boots,\" but I chickened out. You?  Do you have a name, or is that classified? Before Hale can answer...  Terry jumps on the brakes. She and Hale bail out as...  Sprint up the trail.  Follow me! Terry leads Hale up a short slope. Hale scrambles over the top and is stunned. Terry runs out onto an open expanse -- no cover.  Come on! Hale runs in the direction of her voice.  This way. Terry runs. Hale follows.  (looks back, still  Terry is trying to get her eyes to focus.  Please don't tell anyone I did that.  Hale is helping Terry to her feet as BOOM -- the first grenade goes off. They run.  Yeah ...?  Pull herself up, stands, hands up.  This has nothing to do with me.  Watches in horror as...  Dives and rolls over the edge of the cliff as...  Looks up.  Hale runs up, grabs Terry, pulls her to her feet as...  Run clear.  Get out? I don't think that helicopter's going anywhere.      If they've got trucks they could take the four-wheel-drive trail we were on.  He could go to the river. Hale looks at Terry -- that's exactly what Deakins would do.  You gonna shoot out the tires?  The nearest phone is a two-hour walk.  Look, I know my way around here. You're gonna need me.  Jump down onto the roof of the lead Humvee. Hale looks at Terry, angry. But before he can say anything...      Bullets punch up. Hale pulls out the gun. It falls from his hand. Terry grabs it as a sharp swerve sends...  Looks back, sees Hale's predicament.  Here! She slides the pistol along the truck roof.  Comes flying off the top, landing on the hood, barely holding on.  Reaches forward and grabs Baker's gun as...  Climbs into the Humvee, takes the wheel from Hale. She jams Baker's gun into her belt.  Hale keeps his back to the other Humves. He pulls gaffer's tape off a roll, tears it with his teeth, grabs...  Hale climbs up into the front seat. Terry looks at him, genuinely impressed.     It was a copper mine, barely squeaking along for years. They shut it-down a few months ago when they hit an underground river. The hinges on the metal doors buckle and snap and the doors rip loose. Hale shuts down the winch, unhooks it from the doors. He motions for Terry to drive it in.  What are we gonna do? Hale goes to the back of the Humvee, pulls down the tailgate.  Fisher-Price makes nuclear weapons?  And people say the public doesn't benefit from defense spending.  Hale turns to Terry as she pulls over the radio mike.  I don't know. A couple thousand feet.  For what?  We can still hide them!  You're talking about setting off a nuclear weapon!  Tell it to the two-headed cows. Hale grabs the straps around one of the nukes, pulls. He can barely move the thing. He turns to Terry.  No! I am not helping you set off a nuclear weapon.  No!      We'll each drag one down a tunnel?  How do you know how to do this?  Take your time. Really. Hale has pushed the open end of the sock through the eyebolt. He tightens a belt around the open end of the sock.  How much time are we going to have?  Dive to the ground. They pull pistols, start shooting.  Reaches up to grab the big rock, but Johnson sends a spray of bullets in. Terry grabs Hale.  Come on!  Running along a tunnel.  What do we do?  Run back down the side tunnel, bullets winging off the rock all around them, shooting back. Hale starts shooting out the lights, plunging the tunnel into darkness.  In the dark, waiting to ambush Deakins and then...  Suddenly exposed to Deakins' fire. The bullets whiz in.  Take cover. It's a stand-off.  They hear footsteps, receding. Hale bolts out of their hiding spot. Terry follows.  Make a move toward the elevator, but...  Back around a corner, side by side, shooting their pistols.  Step out of the tunnel and fire on the climbing elevator.  We can go back, try to shut it down.  Then we're... Hale looks at her.      Oh, God. Hale takes Terry in his arms, holds her.  I ... I just hope someone remembers to feed my dog. Hale nods, hugs Terry. Terry starts to say something else, but Hale puts a finger to his lips -- he's heard something -- a distant rushing.  What're you --?  No. They look at each other. They don't have any choice. They flick on their flashlights and jump. They-hit the water and are swept from view.  Dodge them, push off, duck under. And then they notice that...  Lungs bursting, they start kicking up.  Goddamn it! He turns to see Terry trying to undo her buttons but unable to her fingers are too numb.  Stupid buttons. I hate these shirts. They're ugly and stupid and -- Terry suddenly starts crying. It's not the shirt she's upset about. Hale holds her.  We just ... I mean, we almost...  A nuclear bomb went off.  Are we...?  Really?  I hit a bankrobber with a frozen chicken.  I came out here one summer during college. It was the campaign to stop the dam in the Grand Canyon. I loved it here. I came back, worked as a river guide and eventually stayed year-round. When a Park Ranger job came open, I applied.      The local Parks Department wasn't sure how I'd do with the law enforcement part of the job. Well, one night I was coming home from the store and Tommy Drewson part of the local brain trust was robbing old Bob Kearney in front of the ATM. I bear old Bob yelling and I see Tommy heading for his car, so I tossed a bag of groceries at him at thirty miles an hour. A frozen chicken in the bag hit him in the forehead and he dropped like a rock. Next thing I know, I'm a Ranger. Hale looks at Terry with a new appreciation.  Get me a frozen Zacky's fryer and he's a dead man. There's the sound of an approaching engine. Sheppard stands, gun ready. The engine stops. A few seconds later...    What?  You'll think of something.  You have so far. Hale looks at Terry -- she's right. But it almost pisses him off more than it gives him confidence. He grumbles to himself and starts off down toward the raft.  Sink it?  Jumps up from the raft and runs after the truck, staying right behind. She grabs a handhold and pulls herself up. She holds on tight as the truck bounces off down the dirt road.      Crouching down between the two cars.  Creeps-up to one of the doors that lead into the driver's compartment. She hears...  Is hiding on the other side of the engine, very quiet and still. As Deakins goes out the back door of the engine, Terry follows.  You said two phone calls.  But -- radio isn't working.  Filled with tears. She blinks and...  Her finger hovers over the ENTER button, almost pushes it, then shifts to CANCEL and pushes that.  I'm gonna be dead either way. I don't want any part of this. Deakins shrugs -- he sees her logic. He puts his gun to Terry's head. Terry shuts her eyes.  Rests on Max's tool tray. Her fingers creep over to a vrench.  Terry swings hard and fast with the wrench, knocking the gun out of Max's hand. Max spins, and when Terry swings at him again. Max kicks the wrench out of her hand, then steps up fast and hits Terry under the chin with the heel of his hand. She drops straight back.  Grabs onto something. It's the wrench.  As Max turns back with the gun, Terry heaves the wrench. It hits Max square in the forehead. He drops like a rock.  Yeah? Well, you should see what I can do with just a chicken.  Pops up out of the hatch, her back to the helicopter.  Watches the helicopter bank away. Bullets-start whizzing by her.  Runs away from Deakins, shooting Max's pistol behind her blindly.  Is caught between Deakins and the gunmen with no way out when...  The bullets rip up the boxcar roof around her. She jumps up and grabs onto...  Are lifted up and over...      Is severed by one of Sheppard's bullets.  Drop ten feet to the roof of a boxcar. Hale shoots as they fall.  Watch the helicopter land as the train rolls on. They look at each other.  You stop the nuke. I'll stop the train. Hale nods. Terry starts forward, then turns.  I'd yell at you for coming after me, but you did just save my life. Hale grins. They hear a helicopter in the distance. They look over to see...  Any excitement turns to confusion when they see...      That's Deakins' escape route.  The train car axle is smoking, grinding, glowing red in the heat from the flaming Toyotas.  Is between the car carrier and a boxcar, looking down at the axle, not knowing what the hell she's going to do when she hears a horn honking. She turns.  The Air Force pays you so little you have to steal shoes off dead people? Hale turns to see...  Walkins over from the Rancher's pickup truck.  Run to each other. They embrace, start smoothing each other's hair, start wiping blood off each other's faces, start kissing, only to be interrupted by...  Terry Carmichael. They shake hands and walk on as we...",
        "Carmichael": "Pretty, late 20s. Her radio squawks.",
        "Vic": "Green, like a radar screen. It's blank, and then two dots appear on the outer edge of the screen.          Rhodes comes down the last few feet of rope to the bottom of the crevice. Kelly, Thomas and Reed are waiting, shining lights on a B-83 lying in the dirt, all in one piece.                                        On the floor.",
        "Deakins": "You know what happened there?  I set you up. I fake right, go left three times in a row. You expect it again, I take the right in hard. That's what boxing's all about. Make your opponent think you're gonna do one thing, then do another. Like Ali in Zaire, using the rope-a-dope on Foreman.  Everyone thought Ali's arms were getting destroyed, when he was really just letting Foreman tire himself out. Eighth round, Ali starts hitting, George's got nothing left -- fight's over.  Several of Hale's punches land. Deakins staggers back, caught off guard. It looks like he might even go down.      Seizes the opportunity and slugs back.  Now Deakins has the upperhand. He backs Hale around the ring.  Don't watch my hands -- watch my shoulders. That's where the punch starts. Ready? Deakins hits Hale hard in the face, sending him back.    You were looking at my hands. Let's try it again. Ready? Deakins hits Hale hard. He's got Hale on the run.  Come on. Focus. Ready?  My shoulders. Ready? Deakins fakes left, puts everything into one big uppercut. It connects.  He's in silhouette, the lights above him.  Deakins offers his hand. Hale pushes it aside. Deakins ignores Hale, grabs him and helps him to his feet. Deakins climbs out of the ring between the ropes. Hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over, landing on his feet. Deakins gives Hale a look, laughs, shakes his head.  On the shady side of the room. Nothing on the inside of his locker door. The locker is spare, Zen-like in its neatness.  I can't take that.  Really. I feel bad. How many times have we fought and how many times have you won?  Well, if you insist. Deakins grins, folds the bill and jams it into his flightsuit.      You know why I beat you?  You don't want it enough. You had me today. I was back on my heels. But you didn't close the door.  Life isn't sparring, Hale.  Here.  If you weren't giving it everything you've got, then I don't want it.  General.      Sorry.  What's the mission, General?  Enter and walk under the plane, nodding to the ground crew. Hale and Deakins are royalty. Deakins and Hale climb up the airplane's Crew Entry steps and disappear.   Ready for rollout.   Weren't you going to call Taylor today about the Aurora Project?  What'd you say?  Jesus. You are such a pussy. You never fight for anything. Hale is stung. Pissed, he goes on the offensive.  Because I said what your problem is, you're gonna--?  I'm usually right though, aren't I? Hale shakes his head, grins. Deakins clicks on his mike.  Ghost 7 to McMurran. Hey, Wilkins, you old bag of dirt, your boys in Utah still awake?      Wilkins says you won't lose them tonight.  (grins, shakes his head; into helmet  Ready, Major?  Go to war.      Descend to 400 feet AGL. River valley approach.  We're under the radar. Proceed to primary target. Hale hits a button, lets go of the stick -- they're on autopilot. It's a moment of peace. Hale looks out.  To God? Is that what you're going to say? That you feel closer to God up here?  Hell, Hale, with the payload we're carrying, we are God. Deakins notices something odd on his screen. He checks between the screen and what he can see through the windshield.  Hale, take a look out your side. I think our terrain following is off. It's got us two klicks from the left flank ridge. Hale turns to look out the window on his side.  Pulls the trigger and the gun FIRES.  Deakins goes for another shot, but Hale grabs the gun and pushes up, sending bullets through the ceiling of the plane, into the walls. Deakins forces the gun down, fires.  Hale brings Deakins' gun hand hard against Hale's own helmet. Deakins yowls and the gun goes flying. Then Hale sees something.  Deakins hits Hale with the back of his hand, knocking him back. Hale grabs Deakins' helmet, yanks it off his head and smashes Deakins back with it. Hale keys the armament buttons.  Deakins grabs a fire extinguisher, swings it, getting Hale in the face. Hale is almost knocked out, blood running from his nose.  AUTO to MANUAL. Deakins grabs Hale's EJECTION HANDLE.  Hale tries to push the handle down as Deakins pulls it up as...  Suddenly lets go of Hale's hand, then hits Hale hard under the chin with the fire extinguisher.   This is Deakins! Hale lost it! I have to punch out! Deakins pulls his second handle. BLAM! WHOOSH! He's gone. He hear and feel the plane dropping, screaming toward the earth.  Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Pritchett. They all look over to see...  Walk out of the shadows, smoking a cigarette. While soldierly with his men, Deakins is courteous and polite with Pritchett.  Well, point of fact, nothing has.  Ah, but we always planned on the search and rescue team finding the weapons for us, and they have. Mr. Pritchett, I really have thought of everything. Johnson walks up, pointing to his radio headgear.  That'll take care of itself.  You don't have to worry about Major Hale. He's probably hiding behind a rock somewhere, praying I don't find him.  Get ready. You'll go when the clean-up's done. Novacek nods, goes to the helicopter. Ext. Canyonlands - 4wd trail Hale and Terry are hurrying along a 4WD trail toward Terry's truck. Terry taken a look at Hale's ripped and torn flightsuit.  Pritchett looks at Deakins -- another part of the plan? Deakins is unperturbed. He's holding an overnight bag. He unzips it.  Brought a tear to my eye.      You see, Mr. Pritchett, they think they've got an exposed core. They'll want to get a satellite to take a look, but it'll take ninety minutes minimum to shift the orbit. Until then? Well, people get a little weird when it comes to radiation. No one'll have the balls to come near here unless it's NEST -- the Nuclear Emergency Search Teams --and it'll take the nearest team at least two hours to get out here, and we only need an hour to reach our connection with the transport squad.  Not that I'm not delighted with your presence, but you really don't need to be here.   Pilot error. Deakins turns and walks away, over to...      Mr. Pritchett, I understand your concerns. You and your associates gave me a lot of money to mount this operation. But they're getting ten times that back if we succeed.  All I can do is my part. We've got the weapons, we're ...  ... seventeen minutes ahead of schedule and everything will be in place within two hours. But I can't guarantee that the assholes in Washington won't do something stupid like not pay.  Then the next census for this region is going to show a very sudden drop in population.  You a fan of boxing, Mr. Pritchett?  Me, too! I love it! Two men trying to do as much damage to the other as he can. As basic as you can get, don't you think?  So do I! God, wouldn't that make it more exciting? Having to go into dark alleys and basements to see a fight? I bet we see eye-to- eye on a lot of things, Mr. Pritchett. Deakins grins; Mr. Pritchett steams.  Run him down.  Kelly ducks below the dash and slams on the brakes but Deakins doesn't flinch. The bullets bounce off the glass --bulletproof.      And is run over.  What're you doing, Hale?  Stop! But it's too late and...  Coolly grabs a fire extinguisher and starts spraying.         Hey, there. What was that last part? There was some static. (clicks off mike; to  Kelly drives Deakins' Humvee along the trail as they talk.  You really got me there. I sure didn't think of that. Hale slows down -- something's wrong -- Deakins doesn't cars.  All that time we spent in the cockpit together and you think I'm stupid? I got some new boards and circuits from a friend at Pantex. But nice try. Hale curses to himself. Terry looks at him. He shakes his head they're in trouble.      You know, Hale, I thought of asking you to join me on this. You wanna know why I didn't?  I would've just killed you if you said no. I was more afraid you'd say yes. Because I knew I couldn't count on you. You can pretend you've got guts, but when and if it comes down to it, you're gonna run off crying like a little girl.   You wouldn't do that.     In the mine.  I could tell he was inside something. There was an echo.   Let's take care of Hale first. Spread out.      He looks at Johnson in disgust, exhales, and tosses the rock. He pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on, talks into it.      We're at the end of tunnel three. (clicks off; to  With his Uzi.  Slows down.  The bit with the sock was good. I like it. Still, I'm gonna use the the Field Expedient Tactical Timer. It's a little more precise.  See, Hale -- you aren't the only one who's thought of setting off a nuke in this mine.  I need a demonstration. Otherwise, some swinging dick in Washington is going to say I don't have the balls or the ability to set off a nuclear weapon. I'm gonna show these puppies I'm ready, willing and able. Hell, I'm eager. Deakins jams in his clip, walks into the dark part of the tunnel.  Opens fire -- but not at Hale and Terry -- at the cable along the ceiling connecting the lights. The cable snaps and electrical sparks shoot out, flooding the tunnel with light, showing...  The muzzle flashes from his Uzi give away his position and Hale and Terry's bullets scream in at him. He backs around a corner.  Well, Hale, I better be going. Look at it this way, partner. If you wanted to get closer to God, you are about to get your wish. Hale hears Deakins' footsteps start off.  What makes you think that?      I'm impressed.  Enough. I've got a broker in Stockholm. Monday morning he's going to buy me five percent of Volvo. For the rest of my days I'm going to live off the dividends, happy in the knowledge I'm helping to build the safest car in the world.  Why would you do it, Hale?  If you were me.  Grim, evil -- fades into darkness as he turns and walks off.  Mr. Pritchett!  Get in. We're leaving.  No time. And if they get out, they might talk. Fortunately, there's something wrong with the elevator. Deakins opens fire with his Uzi on the generator. Sparks fly and the thing shuts down.  Very suddenly and very violently lashes out. The side of his hand hits Pritchett in the throat.  Maybe now you'll shut up.  I just realized I've never killed anyone before. I mean, I dropped bombs on Baghdad, but never face to face.       (thinks about it,  Grins, steps on the brakes.  He's holding a small black box. He presses a button and...  Watching the helicopter, listening to Hunt over the loudspeaker.  Fly ten feet into the air.       At least I know they work.  The helicopter? It was hit by EMP. Electromagnetic pulse. It's released in a nuclear detonation. It wipes out anything electronic for miles. That\"s another reason I wanted to set off a nuke. I knew it'd bring down any helicopters coming for us. It'll also shut down all radio communications for a few hours, which will severely screw up their response.  You see, Mr. Pritchett? There really is nothing for you to worry about. Pritchett's body seems to nod from the motion of the Humvee.  Appears, walking down a footpath toward Sheppard.  I am everyone. Let's go. Sheppard hurries to Deakins. They disappear up the footpath.      Coming down a path, lugging the last remaining nuke.  Because I like him. He doesn't ask a lot of annoying questions. All right? A few seconds later the engine starts up. Hale ducks down under water as the raft takes off over him. He surfaces to watch the raft zooming off into the distance. He is very worried.  Grabs the tarp and pulls.  Throws the tarp over the nuke. As he does, we PAN OVER to...  I wish I could see their faces.  ... two-hundred-and-fifty million dollars, by nine a.m. Utah time. The depositing instructions are in the envelope that came with this tape. This deadline is not negotiable, and there is no grace period. The device is on a timer. Shortly after you receive this, the timer will be activated. At nine a.m., I will make a call. If I find out you've done as you've been told, I will stop the timer. If you have not complied -- The screen suddenly cuts to a flurry of images of nuclear destruction -- buildings being knocked sideways, mushroom clouds, shockwaves, fires.  Wait until I get back. I'm going to check on Sheppard. Deakins goes to a ladder that leads up to the ceiling.  Climbs out and we discover that indeed they are not in a truck, they're in a train. The \"nuke boxcar\" has a small satellite dish mounted on the roof.  How much longer?  Five minutes. We'll leave from the boxcar roof.     Deakins turns to go.  As he puts a gun to the back of Terry's head.  Terry, Max. Max, Terry.  She asked me how I thought I was going to get away with this and I thought I'd tell her.  We're going to a cabin in the mountains, not far from here. When we get there I'm gonna make two phone calls.       The first is to the Pentagon. I'm gonna tell them where the train is.  See, all their forces are up at Salt Lake by now. By the time they could get a F-15 down here the train will be on the outskirts of Vegas. And I'll remind them about the impact trigger -- if they hit this train hard, the nuke'll blow.  They won't have any choice. They'll have to let the train get into the city and because of that, they'll have to pay.  The second will be to my bank in Geneva. If the money's in my account, I use this... (pulls out what looks like a modified cell-  You saw the dish on the roof? Microwave. It's not affected by EMP. See? I really have thought of everything.   No, I kept her alive because I want her to do me a favor. See, if something goes wrong and this thing goes off, a half a million people are going to be vaporized. I don't want that on my conscience. So I'm not going to arm the nuke.       (puts gun to Terry's  Nine ... Then pound ... Good. Now six ...  Seven ... Star ... One...     And Terry shakingly pushing each button and then... The images of the retirees, the teenagers and the children each bleach out to white, fast, as if hit by a nuclear blast.  Then ENTER and it's done.  Stunned. He shakes his head.  Ooh. You really shouldn't have done that. I said I would kill you, and I will.  Night-night. Deakins is about to pull the trigger when Max stops him. Max gestures -- listen. They hear a helicopter approaching. Max checks his watch.  They're early. Just then, they hear gunfire. Max gives Deakins a look.  It's not a problem. Set the timer, then kill her. Have fun with it. Deakins starts climbing up the ladder to the hatch.  Sees what's going to happen and turns and runs as...  Run from the blades as fast as they can.  Jump from car to car. The gunman passes Deakins. Just when the helicopter blades are about to catch up to Deakins...  Jumps down between two boxcars and the rotor blades go right over his head. Deakins hears an awful sound and a scream cut short.  Has climbed up and is shooting at her.  Climbs up fast through the hatch to the roof.  Is reaching for the man's hand and grabs it when...  Deakins kicks free of Hale, holds onto the man in the helicopter and is pulled onboard.  No sign of Hale on the train roof.  Get us out of here!  Hurry!  Leans out of the helicopter with his Uzi, shooting down at...      Sees what's coming and jumps.  Stands there, trying to smile, trying to be cool, but...  They would've paid and I would've stopped it. You've made a very, very big mistake.  If it's over and you beat me, you disarm it.  Course you are going to need this. (holds cell-phone  Share a look. Deakins puts up his fists.  Ready? Hale puts up his fists.  Modern boxing is a pussy sport. They want to make it about scoring points. It's not about scoring points! It's about this!     Deakins fakes a right, jabs with his left, catching Hale on the chin. Hale is jarred. Blood runs from his mouth.  Okay. You're bleeding. Good. In the old fights, there'd be so much blood, guys would slip and fall. Let's see if we can't get a little more of that red goo out of you. Ready? Again Deakins fakes right, jabs left. Hale half blocks it, but is sent back.  Used to be, every fight was to a knockout. You know what happens when you get knocked out? It's your brain slapping against the inside of your skull. Here. I'll let you see what it's like. Ready? Deakins steps toward Hale, about to finish him off. Deakins swings. Hale ducks, comes up hard with all he's got, gets Deakins under the chin and Deakins sails up and back, landing prone, seeing stars.  Is lying at the bottom  of the car, directly under the nuke, not moving.  On the floor.      Flicker open. He sees...  You have to push amber, then red. You might have time to push amber. You won't get to red. Hale turns to see...  Pointing a gun at him.  I know.   Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.  Do it and I shoot. Hale looks at Deakins.  Shoots.  Is about to shoot again, then hears a tearing and looks up as...  His eyes fill with true terror as...",
        "Johnson": "Get out. Johnson wears radio headgear. Pritchett is furious.      Newsflash. Two gunships just left from McMurran and they're headed this way.  Someone else might find him.  A Ranger called her base, said she saw a pilot come down and was gonna go look for him. Deakins thinks it over, turns to Novacek.  Not any longer. They look at him; he taps his radio headgear.  They've just been recalled.  Find them. (to Pritchett and  Got it! They're --  Thirty yards down the tunnel.      Shoots after them, then runs up to the weapon. He reaches for the rock, stops -- maybe that'll set it off.  You two get this one set. I'll take the other one up.  Grab their guns and run.  Run in. A half-second of surprise is broken when...

        "Pritchett": "A neatly groomed man, 40s, with a perpetually sour attitude. He looks like -- and is -- a lawyer.  (to Baker, re: Jim in  Get out. Johnson wears radio headgear. Pritchett is furious.      He better be dead.  You said nothing would go wrong!  You didn't drop the nukes where you were supposed to!  You thought of that?  What about the other pilot? We saw him eject.      Pritchett looks at Deakins -- another part of the plan? Deakins is unperturbed. He's holding an overnight bag. He unzips it.   I hope you've got another surprise up your sleeve. If I'm not mistaken, there are two attack helicopters headed this way.  We don't have to worry about the other pilot? Deakins shakes his head.  Then how come the helicopter crashed?  Tell me again how I don't need to be here.  If we succeed?  What if they don't?  I think it's barbaric.  I think it should be banned.  I can't wait to see how this fits into your plan. Deakins' charm peels away for an instant and he fixes Pritchett with a stare. Pritchett shrinks back.  (re: Kelly and  Is holding on tight as Deakins drives wildly.  I think I've finally figured out your plan. Those guys in the helicopter are going to kill us, but we're going to rise from the dead and  Gags silently, suddenly unable to get any air. He pulls at his throat, even pounds himself in the back of the neck. No go. He slowly slumps, dying, skin turning blue.",
        "Giles": "That's a mistake. The room quiets. All eyes on...  Baird's intensely competent assistant.  Aviation Week has been following this plane's development for years. They have stringers who spend their vacations sitting in lawnchairs all night long by the Whiteman perimeter fence just in case one of these things takes off. The boys in those lawnchairs know one took off tonight. They're going to know when it doesn't come back.       And when we put out a press release saying a C-130 went down in Utah, they're going to put two and two together. Aviation week will run a story, everyone'll know what really happened and we're going to look real stupid.  We might as well tell the truth.  Hell, sir. Sometimes I scare myself. And out Giles goes.  Colonel Wilkins? I'm Giles Prentice.  My word from your search and rescue team?  I'm sorry. Picked up any radiation? Wilkins shakes his head.  That's kind of strange -- if there's an exposed core out there.  Probably nothing. I asked for a transcript of the last cockpit transmission...? Wilkins nods to a CORPORAL who hands some papers to Giles. Giles reads them quickly.  You know these guys? The pilots?   What if this wasn't pilot error?    In the last transmission from the plane, Colonel Deakins said Major Hale lost it and made the plane crash. We all assumed that meant pilot error. But what if Deakins meant Hale made the plane crash. Murmurs of \"That's insane\" \"No way\" fill the room.  Two nuclear weapons would be worth a hell of a lot of money.  I meant they'd be worth a lot of money to us. How much would we pay to get them back? To make sure they weren't used in this country? A flurry of looks around the room.  You think I'm nuts. You don't think NEST or the satellite will find anything weird.          Oh, shit.  That's all we need. A goddamn earthquake.  I have to get out of here.  How do you know?  Are walking toward the second helicopter.  We'd just like to ask you a few questions.  What about her?  Colonel! How about this? Wilkins looks back, sees Hale holding the gun to Giles' head.  Salt Lake is north.  But you said it would be Salt Lake. You found that hospital tag.  The President. Wilkins' finger stops.  Are behind her, grinning.",

        "Max": "Your friends in Washington should be getting the package about now.  Ready when you are.       A pleasure.  What the hell is a \"Terry\" and why is it still live?  You kept her alive just so you can impress her with how smart you are?  Presses ENTER and finishes setting the timer.  There.  Terry swings hard and fast with the wrench, knocking the gun out of Max's hand. Max spins, and when Terry swings at him again. Max kicks the wrench out of her hand, then steps up fast and hits Terry under the chin with the heel of his hand. She drops straight back.  Thought I was just friendly old Max, huh? Lady, I was a Navy SEAL. You should see what I can do with just my thumb. Max goes for his gun.  As Max turns back with the gun, Terry heaves the wrench. It hits Max square in the forehead.

It's Lieutenant Kelly, sir.  Colonel Rhodes is dead, sir! They're all dead!  It's the nuke, sir! It's open! Wide open! Oh, God, what am I going to do?! Deakins puts the shaver to the mike again -- more static. He reaches into the helicopter and flips off the COM LINK switch, then backs away, shaving. He nods to Novacek, who fires up the helicopter.  I'd just like to thank the members of the Academy.  Who have taken the three-foot, pointed, front section off each nuke. They are loading them into the back of one Humvee. Pritchett walks up behind Deakins, still nagging.  Kelly ducks below the dash and slams on the brakes but Deakins doesn't flinch. The bullets bounce off the glass --bulletproof.      Maybe he'll set off a nuke. That'd show us.  Let's go! Johnson pulls out a radiation detector scanner like the one Rhodes used. Kelly and Pritchett get back in the vehicle.  Send it up?  Grab their guns and run.  Run in. A half-second of surprise is broken when...      Unload with their Uzis.  Grabs Johnson's Uzi and, firing both guns, backs to the elevator, kicks open the gate with his foot and gets inside. He hits the UP button with the butt of one of the guns and the elevator starts to rise.  Wrong person to screw with, Deak.     He pulls open the gate and climbs down.  I know the goddamn code, asshole. He grabs the cable trailing off below the elevator and starts sliding down it into the darkness.  Runs up, starts entering numbers into the timer keypad.  Punches in the last two numbers of the code then ENTER.      Sits back on the floor, takes a breath.  Oh shit. The screen goes white."
