When I worked for the previous President, it was my job to be invisible.  This President ... he found out I like English toffee and brought me some back, from his visit to the Queen.  To him, nobody is invisible.  That's where you wait. One of his assistants will come for you. There's a bathroom over there, if you need it.  What are our chances in the World Cup? I mean, for real.  Well, he's not as big as he looks on TV. And we don't stand a bloody chance in the World Cup.  They scored.  We scored.  They scored again.  Ja. We're tied.  We're up by three.  By four. 98.

He wants to win them over, one damn boer at a time.  Molo, sister.  When you get a chance, can we see the schedule for the month? We need to plan security.  We need more men.  Yesterday. 15.  That's Jessie, with the schedule. Come in, beautiful.  What is this?  That's me. Am I under arrest?  What duty?  I don't care if they're signed or --  Wait here.  Sorry to disturb you.

Let's look it over for duty assignments.  We can't.  This is what Madiba wants, okay.  No. Yes. Madiba gets upset if you don't smile when you push people out of the way.  The President's clan name. It's what we call him.  Let's get through this.  Here's a headache.  A rugby match at Loftus Versfeld. British Lions against the Springboks.  I don't care about the game.

If Madiba can do it, we can do it.  Who wants to escort him in?  No autographs.     A homemade explosive from materials every boer already has.  We need snipers on top of the stadium and these surrounding buildings.  We want these two approaches completely sanitized.  We're not going to decide which way we bring him in until the very last moment. We need uniforms, plain clothes, sharp-shooters ...  Yes. No truck bombs, no Oklahoma City.  We've got an army unit on standby at Silvermine, if you need more men. 85.  We're not taking any chances, okay. The President's going to be very exposed. Much too exposed.    How could I?     Have I ever mentioned to you that I hate rugby?  I just want to get him through tomorrow, safely. That's all.  The tickets sold out long before the team became so popular. So it's not exactly going to be the rainbow nation out there. That's the reality. The President will greet the players before the match, he'll present the trophy after the match.

It says, \"He can win an election, but can he run a country?\"  It's a legitimate question.                  Good morning everybody.  Barbara, good morning. You've had your hair done. I like it.  Give me one moment, please.         -- please assemble the staff for me. Whoever has not already left.  Yes, please.  I'd like you to stay out here, please.  I cannot talk to them if I'm hiding behind men with guns.    Some of you may know who I am.  Good morning ... how are you ... thank you for coming at such short notice ... etc.  I couldn't help noticing the empty offices as I came to work today. And all the packing boxes. 13.  Now, of course, if you want to leave, that is your right. And if you feel in your heart that you cannot work with your new government, then it is better that you do leave, right away.  But if you are packing up because you fear that your language, or the color of your skin, or who you served previously, disqualifies you from working here now, I am here to tell you, have no such fear. Wat is verby is verby. What's past is past. We look to the future, now.  We need your help. We want your help. If you would like to stay, you will be doing your country a great service.  I ask only that you do your jobs to the best of your abilities, and with good hearts. I promise to do the same. If we can manage that, our country will be a shining light in the world.         You look agitated, Jason.  What have you done?  Yes. They've had special training, those boys -- with the SAS. And lots of experience. They protected De Klerk. 17.  You asked for more men, didn't you?  In public, when people see me, they see my bodyguards, too. You represent me, directly. The rainbow nation starts here. Reconciliation starts here.     Yes, I know. Forgiveness starts here, too.  Forgiveness liberates the soul. It removes fear. That is why it is such a powerful weapon, Jason. 18.    Only what is necessary.        Good luck, captain.   Thank you for honoring our new flag!  Oh, yes, of course.  Shall we work while we watch? We have lots of promises to keep.  It's not too late, if the boys can just pick up their game.  Where the money is. America, England, Saudi Arabia.  It's also a constitutional right.  Look at that. The whites are cheering for the Springboks, the blacks are cheering for the Lions.  We did that on the island, you know. We supported anyone but the `boks. It really irritated the warders.  How long until the World Cup?  Plenty of time for improvement. 29.  I want to go to India and Indonesia, too.  Very badly.  Why?     You're too good to me.  Did she say why?  No, thank you. I'm going to bed. Good night.     I delegate that decision to you.  No.  No.  Your advice is duly noted, Barbara. 38.  Yes, I know. But in this instance the people are wrong. And it is my job as their elected leader to make them see that.  Can you tell the boys that Madiba wants to go to Eersterust, very fast.  The day I am afraid to do that is the day I am no longer fit to lead.  Brothers, sisters, comrades, I am here because I feel strongly that you made a decision today without sufficient information or foresight. 41.  I am aware of your earlier vote. I am aware that it was unanimous. Nonetheless, I propose that we restore the Springboks. Restore their name, their emblem and their colors, immediately.  Let me tell you why ...  ... on Robben Island, in Pollsmoor Prison, my jailers were all Afrikaners. For twenty seven years, I studied them. I learned their language, I read their history, I read their poetry. I had to know my enemy, in order to prevail against him. And we prevailed, did we not? All of us here ... we prevailed.  Our enemy is no longer the Afrikaner. They are our fellow South Africans, our partners in democracy.  And they treasure Springbok rugby. If we take that away, we lose them. We prove that we are what they feared we would be. We have to be better than that. 42.  We have to surprise them with compassion, with restraint, and generosity.  Yes, I know. All the things they denied us.  But this is not the time to enjoy a moment's petty revenge. This is the time to build our nation using every single brick available to us - - even if that brick comes clothed in green and gold.      Who is with me?  A luxury. All we needed was one more yes than no.  Well, as you know, I am an obedient party member.  But, I must. This minority still controls the army, the police, and the economy. Without them, we cannot address the other problems. 44.  It's a human calculation. If we take away what they cherish -- the Springboks, their national anthem -- we just reinforce the cycle of fear between us.  I will do what I must to break this cycle. Or it will destroy us.  The millions of our people say thank you, and thank you again.  I have come here with a message. People of the Unites States of America: Open your markets to us. People of the United States of American: Come and invest in our country.  I'm fine.  Travelling the world, begging for money, is very tiring.  This is for you.           Morning boys.  How is your family, Hendrick? 50.  I have a very big family. 42 million people.  I don't think I want to walk today.        Hello Barbara. I like that dress.    This is terrible.                 Francois, what an honor. I'm so excited.  Thank you for coming all this way to see me.  Tell me. How's your ankle?  I was told you'd hurt it. Has it healed?  Yes ... yes. In sports, and in life. Come. Sit. Please.  Take this one. Looking into the light hurts my eyes.  Ah, Mrs. Brits -- 60.  -- you are a shining light in my day.  Mrs. Brits, this is Francois Pienaar. He's the captain of the Springboks.  No thank you, I think I'd like to.  How do you take your tea, Francois?  The English have given us many things, including rugby, but afternoon tea is one of the greatest.  You have a very difficult job.  Captain of the Springboks. A very difficult job.  Ah, but then nobody is trying to tear my head off while I'm doing mine.  It is not so difficult to get people to do their best. And I imagine that anybody who plays for their country does their best, almost automatically.  Yes. But to get people to be better than that? 62.  Better than they think they can be? Now, that is difficult, I find.  How do we do that? By example? To an extent. But there is more to it than that ... (searching for the right  How do we inspire ourselves to greatness, when nothing less will do? How do we inspire everyone around us? Sometimes, I think, by using the work of others.  On Robben Island, when things were very hard, I found inspiration in a poem.  A Victorian poem. Just words. But they helped me to stand when all I wanted was to lie down -- But you didn't come all this way to hear an old man talk about things that make no sense.  Yes ... yes. Everybody is preparing.  Yes! I remember when I was a guest at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. The whole stadium welcomed me with a song. At the time the future -- our future -- seemed very bleak. But to hear that song, in voices from all over our planet ... it made me very proud to be South African. It helped me to come home and do better. It allowed me to expect more of myself.  Well, it was Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. A very inspiring song.  We need inspiration, Francois.  Because, in order to build our nation, we all need to exceed our own expectations. 64.    looks down -- -- on Mandela, who is surrounded by HIS GRANDCHILDREN IN THE LIVING ROOM. Mandela likes the babies. THEIR PARENTS, shoo and shepherd the kids, keeping them on their best behavior -- -- for the PHOTOGRAPHERS shooting this family gathering. Seeing the photographers makes this feel staged. Mandela looks past the photographers, sees his daughter ZINDZI glancing in from the doorway, and then moving on.  Excuse me.        What do you think?  Yes, it does.  You criticize without understanding. You seek only to address your own feelings. This is selfish thinking. It does not serve the nation.  Wait. Please.

The country is excited tonight.  The doctor has no sense of occasion. 94.  What man would not be pleased to be dancing with a beautiful woman like you?  Indeed not. My father was a Xhosa chief, and therefore a polygamist. As you know, I am not. But when I look at you ... I envy my father.

Welcome, and thank you for coming such a long way to see me.  Please excuse me for a moment.  This is very good ... very good! Who is our opponent?  Please make sure that my schedule is clear for the entire match.     Let's do some work while we watch.         Are those the judicial appointments for the Free State?         Come and look at this.         Do you still think I'm wasting my time with the rugby?  Barbara, can you please tell the Minister of Sport that I need a detailed briefing on the All Blacks.  Oh yes. Of course.  145 points, in one match?  45 to 29. And it was not that close. They seem unstoppable.  Their Maori war dance. Yes. It's very powerful.  How are we going to beat them?  No ... no. I don't want to break their focus for even a minute. But, how do we win?  It's not enough. Not now. Not so close. This country is hungry for greatness.                  Can a man not sleep in, when he has a big day ahead of him?          Morning, boys. Morning, Madiba.  What is it?             I'm so glad you're here.  Hello, Jonah.   Perhaps we should make a small wager?  I was thinking more along the lines of a case of wine.  How long before the end?

One we all know. We listen together and ... it helps.  May I ask what the song was, sir?  Yes, sir. We probably do.  Hm?  He's ... ... he's not like anyone I've ever met before. 65.  I think ... I think he wants us to win the World Cup.             Ja. Of course.  Come on boys, let's show him.  I'm not going to talk to them.  Whether we like it or not, we're more than just a rugby team. We're ... we're ambassadors inside our own country. And we might as well get used to it.  You know me better than that. Times change. We need to change, too.  Don't forget, we've got TV cameras on us at all times.  Okay Chester -- I reckon you're up.  What you do best.   Let rip. 78.  Let's do our best.  Go get them!  No. The first rule of rugby is you can only pass the ball backwards or sideways.     Tell me something -- how does this help them win rugby matches?  Players-only meeting in the team room after dinner.  Sort of.  We need to learn it. We can't just mouth the words anymore.  They do care.  And now it's one of our anthems.  Okay, boys. It's optional. Take it if you want to.  It means \"God Bless Africa\". Which you have to admit, we could use.    He's injured, sir. His hamstring. We're trying to keep it quiet.  With hamstrings, who knows? We'll miss him.        Uh ... the honor?  Uh uh. I need to be angry for tomorrow.  A poem. From the President.  The same way your visit does. Inspiration.   A change of pace.

Calm.  I wish tomorrow was already here.      No, tomorrow's taken care of, one way or another.  I'm thinking about how you spend 30 years in a tiny cell, but come out ready to forgive the people who put you there.  Breathe, boys. Breathe.    Who's the fittest team on this field?  Keep it here. Run it forward.   We didn't have the support of 63,000 South Africans today. We had the support of 42 million South Africans.  Mr. President, I want to thank you for what you have done.",

What did he want?  You know the best thing about you being the captain?  You don't have to share a room. 95.    What's this?  How does a poem help you play rugby?
