        "Walt": "No, I'd say she doesn't.  I don't think I've ever seen a mother quite so upset. We're all very, very lucky she doesn't want this public.  Dave looks at JIM for help. JIM looks away. Dave's breaths grow more convulsive. Finally -   Dave. Dave, look at me  Dave looks slowly up.   I want you to get some help.  DAVE &amp; SHERRY'S LIVING ROOMNIGHT  Sherry cradles Darryl while Dave grovels at her feet.   If you can't be adults and give these candidates the courtesy they deserve, then you don't deserve to be called adults but children* Because that's what children are. And you'll be treated like children. So let's all listen up.  Walt backs away to his seat. Tracy resumes   I'd say she knows a thing or two about student-faculty dialogue.  JIM nods solemnly   People.  People I  The room quiets down.  Tammy puts her lips close to the mike,    Dr. Hendricks is in a serious post-assembly discussion with JIM and  That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.    Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.   Right.  That's it.  She's suspended for a week!  To emphasize his point, Walt throws his STYROFOAM CUP at the wastepaper basket and misses.  Lowell the janitor, passing by outside the door, notices the cup bouncing on the floor.   Okay.  Three days.  Take care of it.    LISA FLAMAGAN - her face streaked with tears from outrage and confusion.   Jim, where the hell have you been?   Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.   Somebody tore down their posters.   We'll get to the bottom of it.   Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?   You two just go back and focus on your studies.  Mr. McAllister's going to handle this.   Good morning, students.  It, uh, behooves me to inform you of an important change in today's elections. Effective this morning...   . .. sophomore Tammy Metzier has been... Metzier has been determined ineligible - I repeat: ineligible -- for SGA president.  You may not vote for Tammy Metzier.  All other candidates are eligible.  Now please pay attention to a very important, uh, audio-visual presentation. (irritated, thinking he's off Linda, who typed this thing?  I said I need all caps....    Walt is just finishing counting the ballots on his desk. Larry and JIM stand over him.   253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.   Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.   If you say so.   Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.   Fouch, that's enough! End of story.     Mr. McAllister, I hope you can help us clear something up.   Larry, you just take it easy  All turn and stare at Jim. Come to think of it, he does look awfully guilty.    Take a seat, son. We've got something hard to tell you.   She's okay. It's about the election.  Walt closes the door in our faces. We hold on the door.",
        "Hendricks": "Walt is just finishing counting the ballots on his desk. Larry and JIM stand over him.",
        "Tracy": "None of this would have happened if Mr. McAllister hadn't meddled the way he did.  He should have just accepted things as they are instead of trying to interfere with destiny.  You see, you can't interfere with destiny.  That's why it's destiny.  And if you try to interfere, the same thing's going to happen anyway, and you'll just suffer.  JIM MCALLISTER, a teacher in his mid to late-thirties, emerges from the car in running clothes and carrying a briefcase, gym bag, and coffee mug.  On his way to the field, he crosses paths with the janitor.   Good morning, Mr. McAllister.    You know what they say about the early bird.   Thanks, Mr. M.  AS JIM turns and walks away, Tracy watches him.  He stops and picks up some litter, tosses it in a nearby garbage can.   No matter what he says, Mr. McAllister had it out for me from the start.  Oh sure, he was all smiles and good wishes and everything, but underneath he was just as unfair and petty as anybody else.   He'll probably tell you how committed he was to teaching and democracy and integrity and all. Don't be fooled.  After laying the paper down to circle an article, JIM leans back in his chair and momentarily loses himself in thought.    I know.   Ethics are...  FREEZE FRAME on Tracy, her hand lowering, her mouth agape.    INSERTHILLARD HIGH YEARBOOK It fans open to the INDEX.  PAN DOWN to Tracy's name followed by countless page references   Some people say I'm an overachiever, but I think they're just jealous.  A page number turns BOLD, and the other numbers drop away  Suddenly we are on that page, and we PAN to a headline: \"Spanish Club says Oh La!\"  PAN to the group shot and ZOOM in on Tracy smiling in a big SOMBRERO.   My Mom always tells me I'm different -- you know, special. And if you look at all the things I've accomplished so far, I think you'd have to agree.  We see Tracy on other pages too: \"Yearbook Staff goes for it!\" \"Junior Achievers put on the dog!\" \"Student Council meets the challenge;\" Oklahoma's a hit!   Here I am in Oklahoma.  The STILL of Tracy in Oklahoma suddenly COMES TO LIFE.    I'm just a girl who can't say no...   And here I am on KMHS, our student-run TV station.   ..that's why Principal Hendricks made the controversial announcement that the littering must stop.  Tracy Flick reporting.   But it was in SGA, the Student Government Association, where I made my biggest mark.  I never missed a meeting, and I volunteered for every committee as long as I could lead it.  Before Ashley can finish, Tracy STANDS UP   I agree with Ashley.  We should rent the barrels at least a day beforehand. What happened last time was a travesty, I mean, we were --     ...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...   YOU probably think the worst - that Mr. Novotny was just taking advantage of one of his students, but it wasn't like that at all. Our relationship was based on mutual respect and admiration. I mean, during my sophomore year in geometry it was strictly professional between us -- I mean, nothing.  EXT. GODFATHER'S PIZZA -- NIGHT The parking lot, the neon lights, the promise of good times.   It wasn't until junior year when we worked together on the yearbook that things got serious.  INT. GODFATHER'S PIZZA -- NIGHT Dave and  Tracy are at a booth along with six other students.   One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.   what?   No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.   What do you mean? What kind of person am I?    Thank you.   Since I grew up without a dad, you might assume psychologically I was looking for a father figure.  DISSOLVE through the darkroom door to  DAVE AND TRACY bathed in red light.  Tracy is sitting on Dave's lap as they make out hungrily.   But that had nothing to do with it at all.  It was just that Dave was so strong and made me feel so safe and protected.   It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.   When I think back on my relationship with Mr. Novotny, what I miss most. is our talks.   ...certain time in history and  RINGGGGG  Maybe not.  At the bell, students instantly shut their textbooks and collect their things.   Now that I have more life experience, I feel sorry for Mr. McAllister.  CLOSE-UP FROZEN DETAILS - of Jim's appearance - his slightly frayed collar and bad tie; the heels of his old docksiders worn down at irritating angles; the faded impression his too-big wallet has made in his khakis; his growing bald spot; his ear hairs.   I mean, anyone who's stuck in the same little room saying the exact same things year after year for his whole life, wearing the same stupid clothes, while his students go on to good colleges and move to big cities and do great things and make loads of money has got to be at least a little jealous.  It's like my room says - the weak always try to sabotage the strong.  Tracy turns and walks out the door.    CLOSE ON A SMILING LITTLE TRACY - in a Sears-style portrait.  PAN across a wall full of other framed photos of Tracy accepting awards, dancing in a recital, poised to dive at a swim meet.   One thing that's important to know about me is that I'm an only child.  So my Mom is really devoted to me, and I love her so much.  She wants me to do all the things she wanted to do in life but couldn't.   See, Mom used to be a stewardess for Northwest and now works as a para-legal. She likes to write letters to successful women like Janet Reno and Elizabeth Dole and ask them how they got to be where they are and what advice do they have for me, Tracy, her daughter.  CLOSE ON BARBARA'S TONGUE as the envelope flap slides across it.   Nine times out of ten they say you have to hold on to your dreams no matter what.  The pressures women face mean you have to work twice as hard, and you can't let anything or anyone stand in your way.  A shabbily dressed BURNOUT -- DOUG SCHENKEN -- walks past and grabs a huge handful of gum.   One per person!  Put those back I  John just keeps on walking away, and his two BUDDIES take great delight in his nimble-witted, quick retort.   Ninety-seven.. .ninety-eight.   But you know,  winning isn't everything.  If you play fair and follow all the rules thoroughly, you'll always come out ahead.  Win or lose, ethical conduct is the most important thing. Just ask Mr. McAllister.     Mr. McAllister? Mr. McAllister! Wait up  I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!   Here they are.   Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.   Aren't you supposed to keep them?   I thought you were supposed to keep them.   Thanks for everything.    I can't wait to start campaigning.   Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.   You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?   Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.   ...You know, Coca-Cola's by far the number one soft drink... When I win the presidency we're going to be spending a lot of time together... a lot of time... lots and lots and lots of time... president and advisor. . .  CLOSE ON JIM'S EAR as Tracy's LIPS magically whisper into it.   ...harmonious and productive... close and special... you and I...  so close... so intimate... together...   The right side is too high. The right side. Just a smidge.  Suddenly she notices a small COMMOTION in the adjacent cafeteria and goes to investigate.   Who put you up to this?   Who put you up to this?   You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?   Thought what?   So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.   Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on.  With that Tracy turns and SIGNS Paul's sheet  THE \"I\" IN \"FLICK\" is dotted with a STAR  CLOSE ON TRACY'S FACE - as she walks away, Paul and his fans receding behind her   You might think it upset me that Paul Metzier had decided to run against me, but nothing could be further from the truth.  He was no competition for me: it was like apples and oranges. It just meant I had to work a little harder, that's all.      in a xeroxed photograph. \"Vote Tracy!\" is written at the bottom.  Tracy is making campaign buttons with her BUTTON MACHINE. She manufactures her buttons with almost alarming intensity. PATRIOTIC MUSIC begins to rise.   You see, I believe in the voters. They understand that elections aren't just popularity contests. They know this country was built by people just like me who work very hard and don't have everything handed to them on a silver spoon.    drop one by one into a box. All the little round Tracys smile up at us.   Not like some rich kids who everybody likes because their fathers own Metzier Cement and give them trucks on their sixteenth birthday and throw them big parties all the time.  They don't ever have to work for anything.  The .bus pulls away.      staring into camera as she exercises on a NORDIC TRAC, Drenched in sweat, she moves in a hypnotic frenzy.   They think they can all of a sudden one day out of the blue waltz right in with no qualifications whatsoever and try to take away what other people have worked for very, very hard their entire lives. No, it didn't bother me at all I   Do it, Jim.  Fuck me.  JIM is at once in deep-space ecstasy and surprised at himself. Diane's voice now changes: it's Tracy's VOICE.   Fuck me, Mr. McAllister   You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.   Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.   Let me see them.  Let me see them  Sighing, JIM fishes in his drawer and hands Tracy some sheets   These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.   Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!   Poet Henry David Thoreau once wrote, \"I cannot make my days longer, so I strive to make them better.\"  With this election, we here at Millard also have an opportunity to make our high school days better.  During this campaign I have had the opportunity to speak with many of you about your concerns.  I spoke with freshman Eliza Ramirez, who told me how alienated she feels from her own homeroom.  I spoke with sophomore Reggie Banks, who said his mother works in a cafeteria and can't afford to buy him enough spiral notebooks for his classes.  I won't bore you with long- winded promises about all the new and innovative things I will definitely achieve during the year in which it will be my honor and privilege to represent each and every one of you, but I can say that my years of experience on the student council have taught me the three most important attributes the president needs to possess;  commitment -   The three most important attributes the president needs to possess are: commitment, qualifications, and experience.  I'll add one more; caring. I care about Millard, and I care about each and every one of you, and together we can all make a difference.  One of the things I would like to establish is a regular open forum where any student can come and voice their concern about issues we face here at Millard.  I and the rest of the student council would then interface with the faculty and staff, so a continuous dialogue would exist.  Walt whispers to Jim.   When you cast your vote for Tracy Flick next week, you won't just be voting for me.  You'll be voting for yourself and for every other student Our days won't be any longer, but they can sure be better.  Thank you.  Tracy smiles and walks back to her folding chair.  There is polite applause and a few whistles.  JJJB comes back to the microphone.  Tracy takes her seat next to Paul and glances at him.  Paul scares straight ahead, a fat bead of sweat on his forehead. One of his legs is jiggling.     What happened at the speeches was an unconscienceable travesty. That little bitch Tammy Metzier wanted to make a fool out of me. Well, it wasn't going to work. People do care who wins. Things do matter.  Finally, we're high enough to read:     Eric, the \"r\" is supposed to be green, not blue.   That's okay.  I'm too busy.  Ouch.  INT. MILLARD YEARBOOK OFFICE -- NIGHT A haggard Tracy sits alone at a computer monitor   People are so ungrateful.  If all those students who cheered for Tammy Metzier only knew how hard I worked for Millard. Like all the late nights I spent at the yearbook office just to give them their memories.   One of my duties was to clean up the group photos.  It was a cinch with our new software.    Let's see... \"save\" is Command \"S.\" Okay.   I didn't do this.  I didn't do it.  She lifts the top off a garbage can, removes the PLASTIC LINER.    Tracy drives, sucking on a wounded hand. She glances frequently in the rear-view mirror.   When I arrived at school that morning, I was shocked to find that one of my key banners had been removed by vandals. I noticed that a few of my rival's posters had also been tampered with. Of course, I was outraged, but one day before the election is not the time to lose your head over a couple of posters. When you're in the public eye, attacks like that just come with the territory.  Finally she reaches the   If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.   Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!  JIM stares at her.   Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?   I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.   I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.   well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.  JIM shifts gears   Why are you lecturing me?   I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.   And I think certain older persons like you and your \"colleague\" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.  JIM draws a long breath as he tries to control himself   This ought to be good   Yes?   What do you mean?   I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!    FROM OVERHEAD - Tracy slides out of her bed and kneels beside it   Dear Lord Jesus, I do not often speak with You and ask for things, but now I really must insist that You help me win the election tomorrow, because I deserve it and Paul Metzier doesn't, as You well know.  l realize that it was Your divine hand that disqualified Tammy, and now I'm asking that You go that one last mile and make sure to put me in office where I belong, so that I may carry out Your will on Earth as it is in Heaven. If elected I promise that I will pray more often.  Okay?  Amen.    Tracy and her mom are hard at work frosting cupcakes.   Mom and I got up at five AM, and together we custom-iced three hundred and fifty cupcakes.  CLOSE ON A CUPCAKE - as \"PICK FLICK\" is written on it with a yellow icing tube.  MRS. Flick cheerfully performs her task. She hums.    I remember she was so happy, like there was nothing in the world she'd rather be doing.  Besides me and her job, I guess my mom doesn't have much of a life.  She hasn't dated anyone since Frank, and she hardly ever buys new clothes for herself or travels.   Mom?   I think I'm going to lose today   You really think so?  Mrs. Flick puts an arm around her daughter    Good morning, Mr. M.  JIM stops, turns slowly, regards mother and daughter with a crazed, one-eyed, uncomprehending stare.    Looks like you could use a cupcake!  JIM takes it wordlessly.  AS he heads up the walkway, he eats it in two huge bites, like a feral animal.    What's wrong with your eye?  Are you  When the time came to cast our votes, I stood in line just like everyone else.  She finally reaches the front of the line.   Tracy Enid Flick.   Phil you ready?    Just wait.  FLASH!  Phil gets his shot and Tracy drops her ballot in.   Thanks, Phil.  On her way out Tracy passes Paul at the end of the line.  He gives her an enthusiastic THUMBS UP.    Yeah.    Good luck to you too, Paul.   You know that moment when they announce the winner of a beauty pageant?  When Miss Texas or whoever suddenly realizes she's Miss America, and all she can do is scream and weep and hug the losers? I had my moment in the hallway that Tuesday afternoon with no one to hug but myself.  She pulls herself together enough to peek through the window of the OTHER DOOR to Jim's classroom, the window behind which JIM is still busily doing his count.   Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.   Yeah.   Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.      her face drained and pallid, her eyes red and bleary: she is exhausted from crying.   One vote... one vote  She falls again headlong again into the throes of despair. Her mouth contorts into a rictus of agony, and there issues an almost feral cry of pain. Her anguish grows convulsive.  Barbara Flick comes in and sits on the bed. She's carrying a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and a glass of milk.   Senior year was very productive for me and full of personal achievement.   Order.  Order.  Order I  Can we vote on this?  Those in favor.   On top of a very successful student council year, I got into Cornell like I wanted, with scholarships, and I was in the top 7th percentile of my graduating class.  TRACY Approved   But sometimes I got lonely, and I'd think about Dave.  I missed our talks. Maybe it could have worked out between us.  I don't know.   I wonder what he's doing now. Maybe he finally finished his novel   When the yearbooks came out, I was on almost every page.   Paul, will you sign my yearbook?   Can I sign yours too?   I thought very carefully about what to write.  Because despite everything that had happened with the election, I really wished him well.  I even signed it...  CLOSE ON - Tracy writing: \"Love, Tracy\" beneath her inscription  Tracy takes Paul's book back to him.  He's already working on another annual and barely looks up when he swaps with her.   Yes, Paul?    Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.  Tracy opens the book as she walks and stops when she finds  AN ALMOST BLANK PAGE with Paul's puny inscription at the bottom:  Have a great Summer!  Good luck at college   Paul Metzier'    Tracy looks at herself in a mirror, as though dispassionately assessing her own face.  Then she begins to put on lipstick.   After graduation, I don't know.  ; somehow felt empty inside.  I guess high school just seemed so meaningless now and I couldn't wait to get out of Omaha. Next year I was going to make all new friends.  Smarter, more ambitious friends.  It was time to move on. There was nothing left for roe here.  I just had one more thing to take care of.   Hello, Mr. M.   I'm looking at new cars.   My mother's buying me a new car for college.   Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.   Sporty.   Where to?   Yeah.   Uh-huh.   That sounds good.  A silence   Yes?   Doing what?   Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?  JIM just looks at Tracy - it's so very odd    I've got an idea.  Tracy suddenly signals and takes a right.   My house.  Tracy sets the parking brake.  Jim's eyes register a suppressed panic.   I want you to do something for me.    I just have to get something. I'll be right back.  Tracy heads toward the house. JIM sits and waits.  He scans Tracy's house, notices the chipped and peeling paint,  the rusting lawn furniture, the bowed porch steps.  NOW TRACY opens the door and gets in. She carries her YEARBOOK  and gives it to Jim.   Would you sign it for me?  Tracy reaches over the parking brake and flips the yearbook to the blank pages at the beginning.   Take as much room as you want  JIM removes a pen from his breast pocket and uncaps  it. He considers what to write.   I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.   I hope so",
        "Flick": "Hmmm?   What are you talking about? This time tomorrow, you'll be president   Tracy Flick's a winner.",
        "Dick": "I don't get it.  What you have against your mother and me, against your brother Paul, is completely beyond me.  And your mother is extremely upset, she's at the end of her rope.  Your behavior gets crazier and crazier and wilder and wilder, and who knows what the hell else you're doing out there that we don't even know about?   (jabbing his finger Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!   What?   You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!  ANGLE FROM UNDER THE TABLE - Her head low. Tammy SMILES to herself   (extending his hand) Hi. Dick Metzier. My wife --   Yeah, say, apparently you've really come behind him, really helped him out there with the student council thing and all.   Having a problem with your eye there?   You ought to get that looked at. Shot of cortisone or something.   Anyway, we're awful sorry about what went on with our other one, you know, our Tammy.   Say, you're all alone,  why don't you join us?   All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.",
        "Metzler": "Two GIRLS are kissing on the bed. They are TAMMY METZLER and LISA FLANAGAN, fifteen and seventeen respectively. Lisa breaks away. Tammy tries to kiss her again, but Lisa resists.    Whistling a cheerful tune, Paul tosses his backpack on a chair, grabs a banana, and opens the refrigerator.    Tammy is still trying to comfort Lisa.    Tammy finds the front door flung open and through it sees Lisa slamming the door of her beat-up Honda Civic and starting the engine.    Dick Metzier and his wife JO are at the breakfast table Tammy sits across from them, her eyes lowered.   (extending his hand) Hi. Dick Metzier. My wife --   (extending her hand JO Metzier. You know, Paul just thinks the world of you. Oh, if you could just hear him...",
        "Jo": "Dick... Dick,..    Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --   Well, we've had good luck at Millard, but for this one it's time for a change.  Tammy spins and admires the flip of the skirt.   You're just going to have to get used to it.    We'll take two.   (extending her hand JO Metzier. You know, Paul just thinks the world of you. Oh, if you could just hear him...   We are   Dick.   We were mortified...   ... but we've had some good talks, and I think we're sorting things out.  We're starting her at Sacred Heart in the fall.   So nice",
        "Lisa": "I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?   I said no!  Suddenly, there's a quick KNOCK at the door, and Paul enters. The girls rise quickly.   I gotta go.  Lisa pushes her way past Paul and runs down the hall   I'm not like you.   I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.  Lisa speeds away, and we watch her car grow smaller and smaller.    in SLOW MOTION, swinging next to us. She looks  back, her face so happy.   Are you crazy?   People can see this.   These are private -- these are for us.   But other people can see them too.   Well, I do.  Lisa walks away with the photos     I've wanted this for so long.  She resumes with renewed vigor   Sorry.    Paul's truck pulls up, and Paul and Lisa get out    Tammy peeks OVER THE FENCE and sees --  LISA AND PAUL swimming.  Paul dives off the board and resurfaces right into Lisa's arms.  MOVE CLOSER TO TAMMY as she dies a thousand deaths.   It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.   She's doing this to get back at me   I mean at you.   I don't know.  You're her brother you should know.  TRACY returns.   It's not fair.  It's not fair  Paul sits next to Lisa on the vinyl sofa.  He wants to console her, but he doesn't know how.   If Paul loses tomorrow, it's not fair. There has to be another election,  with posters.   Didn't you see?   Those posters cost a lot of money we don't have I  There's no time to make any more posters, there's no --   It was Tammy I  That's who it was.   She should be expelled.  Or worse!",

        "Novotny": "IN QUICK TIGHT CUTS we see Dave and Tracy DISROBING  Tracy's head and naked shoulders lay themselves on Dave's pillow.  She looks toward the foot of the bed at -- DAVE, unable to believe his eyes.  He looks at naked Tracy up and down, up and down, his breath quickening.  Sade wafts up the stairs.    A laughing BABY BOY is lowered into frame and pulled back up again. Then he swings across frame.  It's little DARRYL NOVOTNY.    JIM is snapped out of his reverie by Sherry's voice    Sherry stands at the base of a stepladder as JIM climbs up and points to a spot on the ceiling.    JIM and Sherry stumble in from the hallway locked in an embrace.  They rove around the room, barely able to keep their balance.  Finally, they fall to the ground.    JIM starts his car.  Sherry leans into his window.  She looks around the neighborhood before kissing him firmly on the mouth.",
        "Paul": "Stop daydreaming! Get back to work!  JIM enjoys the affectionate joshing and gives the kid  a wave. He returns to his newspaper, a contented man.   Why. . . ? Why. . . ?   I was so mad at God when I broke my leg at Shadow Ridge over Christmas break.   The doctors told me I'd have to quit sports for at least a couple years if not forever.   ...which meant no first-string quarterback in the fall. It was like the end of my life!   When I got back to school everybody was so supportive, and they all wanted to sign my cast and everything...  EXT. MISSOURI RIVER LOCKOUT -- DAY Alone, Paul leans on his crutches and watches the river   ... but I still couldn't shake the feeling that now my life had no purpose. What did God want from me?  THE VAST MISSOURI - always flowing, never stopping, no beginning, no end   Why did I exist?   Sometimes you can search everywhere for answers. Then one day destiny just taps you on the shoulder. I know, because it happened to me.  A FINGER reaches down and taps Paul's shoulder. Paul comes to and looks -- it's Mr. McAllister.   Mr. McAllister changed my life. And no matter what they say he did or did not do, I believe he is a good man.  JIM'S CLASSROOM - DAY Paul sits in a chair, while JIM stands   I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...   Yeah.   What do you mean?   Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --   And she's super-nice   Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears   No, wait -- apples.  Apples.  JIM draws illustrative circles on the board as he speaks.   I also like bananas.   I gotta talk to him first.  Tracy watches the hubbub, none too pleased, and pushes her way to the front of the group.   Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy  Tracy stares at him.   What do you mean?   No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --   Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --   Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --    Paul drives home, his stereo thumping. Silent, he appears lost in thought, as though a little gopher idea were burrowing its way to the surface. Oh, look -- there's its snout  now.   Paul... Paul... power... Paul... Paul for President... progress... promise... peanut... Paul-i-tics... yeah... President Paul... Punt for Paul!  No.  EXT. METZLER HOMEDAY Paul pulls into the driveway and hops out of his car.   Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.   Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.   So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --   What'd I do?    matched in size to Tammy's. He is moaning, gasping.   I sure was surprised the day Lisa Flanagan asked me for a ride home and ended up blowing me.  Lisa pauses and looks up at Paul.   Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.   Life is so weird.  First Lisa has a big fight with my sister, and the next thing you know she's my girlfriend.  Lisa turns around to look at  TAMMY seated at another table directly behind them.  She and Lisa lock eyes before they both turn around again.   Since Lisa knew all about public relations and stuff, she offered to help me with my campaign.  We made a great team!  Tammy spies from underneath the bleachers   It seemed so natural, the two of us together.  It was like destiny.  Tammy watches from a nearby classroom door, her nose and cheek pressed against the window.   That spring was perfect.  My leg wasn't bugging me too much, and the weather was so nice.  And every afternoon after school. Lisa and I would go to her house to fuck and have a swim.  It was like we were in a world all our own.  Tammy emerges from behind a tree.  She's on her bike.  Angry and fragile, she watches the couple enter Lisa's house.   Tammy? Tammy, what are you doing?  Tammy ignores her brother and keeps walking directly toward us, finally INTO CAMERA.  INT. MILLARD TEACHERS' OFFICES -- DAY Tracy sits opposite Mr. McAllister.   We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?   For what?   For what?   As many of you know I broke my leg pretty bad thi3 year and the experience has made me reevaluate what I want to do with my life and that is help people when you think about it a school is more than a school it's our second home where we spend all cur time and grow as individuals and a community but is our school everything it could be I want our school to reach its true potential that is why I am running for president.  JIM pinches the bridge of his nose, clearly pained  A few loud SOUND EFFECT SNORES saw through the air, and Walt points a stern finger at - you guessed it -- Doug Schenken.   I know what it is to fight hard and win like when we almost went to state last fall and I threw that fourth-quarter pass against Westside for the touchdown that won the game by three points I won't let you down like I didn't then I promise we can all score a winning  touchdown together. Vote Paul Metzier for president thank you.  Paul now gets considerably less applause, but his jock friends remain loyal.   Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.  Tammy looks at him, picks up the packet.   I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -   Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.   Okay.  Great.  I feel good.  Paul is about to leave again but   Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Right.  One other thing.  Since you know Lisa so well, could you give me some advice?  I want to get her something for helping me with the election.  You know, something really special -- like flowers or candy or flowers and candy.  Or is that too typical?  I mean, can you think of something? Something really special? You know, something she'd really like?  Tammy looks as though she'd like to push the button on all the world's atomic bombs.   I just don't think anybody would do something like that on purpose.  It must have been some kind of mistake. Like a maintenance thing.  JIM enters.    We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --   Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...    FROM OVERHEAD -- Paul lies in bed looking at the heavens beyond his ceiling,   Dear God, thank You for all Your blessings.  You have given me so many things, like good health, nice parents, a nice truck, and what I've been told is a large penis, and I'm very grateful. But I sure am worried about Tammy.  In my heart I still can't believe she tore down my posters, but sometimes she does get so weird and angry.  Please help her be a happier person, because she's so smart and sensitive, and I love her. Also, I'm nervous about the election tomorrow, and I guess I want to win and all, but I know that's totally up to You.  You'll decide who the best person is, and I'll accept it.  And forgive my sins, whatever they may be.  Amen.   Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?   Hell, good luck!   Thanks!  INT. VOTING BOOTH Paul scans his ballot, struggles with his decision.   It's so weird.  DO people always just vote for themselves?  'Cause looking at my own name on the ballot, I just... I don't know, I just felt like it's not right to vote for yourself.  THE BALLOT - as Paul's pen puts an \"X\" next to the name \"Tracy Flick   Hey, Mr. M. Big day, huh?  Jim doesn't even hear.   Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.     You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.  JIM approaches the microphone   Geez, you guys, thanks a lot.  I mean, wow, thanks.  I promise to do my best and really do a good job and be a good president.  And I want to thank Lisa Flanagan for being a super campaign manager. And I just want to say that I think Tracy would have made a great president too and that she really deserves a big hand.  The auditorium erupts into applause and whistles, and JIM takes the microphone again.   Wow! Mr. McAllister! This is so wild. We came to celebrate my victory, and I can't believe it. Here, these are my parents.  JIM stands up awkwardly.   This is great.   I never would have ran if it wasn't for Mr. M.   Yeah!    Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.   So, Mr. M,  I was starting to think about ideas for next year. I was thinking it would be cool to have, like a carnival.  With rides.  And, you know, it could be for, like. Muscular Dystrophy.  JIM tries to smile and seem attentive, but we sense his profound fatigue and his profound sadness.   And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -   Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.  The wind out of his sails, Paul gets up and is about to go when   Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.   Huh?   Senor presidente. Yo soy senor presidente... El grande presidente...   I don't know why, but finding out there was a mistake and I hadn't won the election after all didn't bother me that much. Winning had seemed kind of unreal anyway. I guess I should have voted for myself. Oh, well.  Paul reaches the --  INT. SCHOOL OFFICECONTINUOUS and enters Walt's office. Everyone is there   Is Tammy okay?    twisting to the music at a PARTY, a giant grin on his  face, a big sombrero with tassels on his head. Behind him  we can see an enormous illuminated GRAVEL CONVEYOR. SUPER-IMPOSED:  \"ONE YEAR LATER.\"   Senior year was great I Sure, I didn't get to play ball or be president, but I got elected homecoming king and prom king anyway. I got into Nebraska like I wanted and early-rushed Phi Delts. At the end of the year me and my buddies threw a hitching Mexican party down at the cement plant. Shit, that was a good party. That was a good party!   The only really bad thing about senior year was Lisa. Right before Christmas she dumped me. One minute she's totally in love with me and then boom she's going out with my football buddy Randy.  Paul looks over at  LISA dancing suggestively with RANDY  Paul looks sad, takes another gulp, waves at unseen  friends.   Sometimes I wonder what would've happened if I'd actually won the election.  Maybe my whole life would be different.  Like I might never have gone to Yosemite with Greg and Travis.  Paul takes a BIG GULP and looks into camera.   Or maybe I'd be dead.   Sure, Tracy.  Paul takes the book, efficiently finds the page with his picture, and goes to work.   Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*  Nolan finishes and hands the book over.  Tracy turns to the front pages and finds them completely filled, as are the end pages.  Now she looks for her picture.  When she finds it, it's almost completely obscured by part of some ASSWIPE 'S long, illegible, exclamation point-filled message.  Finally, she locates an available space and begins to write.   Thanks, Tracy.  Tracy starts to walk away and Paul stops her   Hey, Tracy I..  She turns around expectantly   Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.",
        "Diane": "Anything wrong?   Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.   Here.  Give him to me. (as she takes Darryl is little Darryl dizzy?  That's it. . come here. . .   Yeah.  Sherry heads into the house.  JIM watches her walk, then turns toward Diane and Darryl.  It's as though Diane, not Sherry, were the infant's real mother, so loving and attentive is she, so swelled with maternal piety.   You gonna do it? You gonna do it?   Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up   Do it!  JIM finally climaxes   Okay!  With that JIM rolls off of her. Diane immediately hoists her knees to her chest.  CLOSE ON JIM - on his side of the bed facing away from Diane.   Could you hand me the remote?   How'd it go?   You guys have fun?  JIM picks an apple out of a bowl.   What?   Oh, Jim! Oh, God!  SHERRY'S HEAD, like a cut-out from a tabloid cover, floats in from off-screen and lands on the back of Diane's head. At the right moment, her face COMES TO LIFE and vaguely mouths the words that Diane is saying, like a badly-dubbed movie.   Oh, God.  Just like that.  Oh yes. Fill me up...  Jim's wicked desire increases with each movement  Now TRACY FLICK'S FACE floats over and replaces Sherry's. Tracy mouths Diane's words.   Do it, Jim.  Fuck me.  JIM is at once in deep-space ecstasy and surprised at himself. Diane's voice now changes: it's Tracy's VOICE.    JIM enters the back door and sets his satchel down in the usual place. He opens the refrigerator, grabs a beer.  As he closes the door, something catches his eye.  He reaches inside and throws a plastic container away.  Rooting around noisily, he finds other things to dispose of.  Suddenly --  A BABY CRY stops him cold.  JIM stiffens, his good eye widening as the horrible truth sinks in. He carefully closes the refrigerator and tiptoes toward the living room.    together on the living room sofa, staring at him.  Their eyes are red from crying.  Little Darryl squirms in Sherry's lap.  Caught, JIM emerges from his hiding place.  No one speaks. Finally, he looks down, sucks in air, blows it out again, nods a little.",
        "McAllister": "JIM and his wife Diane sit at their dining room table, eating chicken pot pies, baked potatoes with sour cream, salad with Lite Ranch dressing. Not a word passes between them.    JIM lies awake in bed while Diane snores beside him. Something seems to be echoing in his head.    In the darkness a light pops on, and JIM quietly pads down the stairs.  He opens an old CEDAR TRUNK, lifts out a few blankets and a piece of cardboard to reveal a row of PORNO TAPES cleverly concealed in the bottom of the trunk.    JIM and Diane copulate.  Although ostensibly near climax, JIM seems to be struggling.  Diane's exhortations, once forbidden and exciting, now seem routine.    Diane lies face-down, and JIM is on top of her. JIM makes spirited love with her.    JIM drifts toward his house, and it absorbs him through the front door.    We're no longer in rear-projection land: reality has caught up with Jim. As he walks across the room, he strips off his shirt, shoes, socks, and finally pants. Left only in his underwear, he walks through the house and out into the -  EXT. MCALLISTER BACKYARDDAY and flops down in the grass, facing the sky.",
        "Jim": "Morning, Lowell  Lowell nods, hoists a bag and tosses it into a dumpster.   Twenty-one... twenty-two.  He collapses onto his back.  His head rolls to one side, and he glances past the fence at --   Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?   Yes, I do.  An awkward moment passes between them.   Well, good luck there, Tracy    Alone in his room, JIM studies the Omaha World-Herald   It's hard to remember how the whole thing started, the whole election mess. What I do remember is that I loved my job. I was a teacher, an educator, and I couldn't imagine doing anything else.  Suddenly a VOICE --   The students knew it wasn't just a job for me.   C'mon, wolverines!  Defense!  Let's hold 'em back!   I got involved. And I cared.   And I think I made a difference.   I knew I touched the students' lives during their difficult young adult years, and I took that responsibility seriously.   In the twelve years I taught U.S. History, Civics and current Events at Millard, I was voted Teacher of the Year three times - a school record.    Mr. McAllister reads aloud from the newspaper as he paces in front of his class of high school juniors, Tracy Flick among them. The seats are arranged in a SEMI-CIRCLE.   Standing in front of a room full of young people, trying to make them think that's how I wanted to spend the rest of my life,  JIM slaps the newspaper for emphasis and addresses the class   So would this be an ethical situation or a moral situation? What's the difference between ethics and morals, anyway?  Tracy shoots her hand into the air.  JIM notices but keeps looking around.   Anybody  Other hands rise tentatively   Derek   You're on the right track,  who can help him out?   Michelle?   Or a life experience.  Good.  And ethics?   Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?    Tracy.   Tracy Flick.  Tracy Flick.  I've never met anyone quite like Tracy Flick.   She first showed up in my life as a freshman delegate in student council. I'd seen a lot of ambitious students come and go over the years, but I could tell right away Tracy Flick was different.  JIM observes Tracy, trying to size her up.  ON TRACY -- putting all her little things in order, finally folding her hands to wait.   It wasn't long before everyone knew who Tracy Flick was.  She made sure of that. Her drive was astonishing.  Even scary.    BACK TO TRACY still frozen mid-sentence, waiting to finish her answer.   Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.   Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.   A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.   Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.   Dave came to Millard the year after I did, and we hit it off right away. We backed each other up in teachers' meetings and shared an interest in 60's music and micro-breweries.  CLOSE ON DAVE really getting into it, playing to an unseen stadium. Behind him JIM is very careful with his chords.   You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.    CAMERA DRIFTS from the open basement stairway door and toward DIANE MCALLISTER and SHERRY NOVOTNY seated at the kitchen  table. They are fussing over little six-month-old DARRYL NOVOTNY in his highchair.   Our wives became best friends too. And when Dave and Sherry's son Darryl was born, they asked us to be godparents.  At a particularly grating note from downstairs, Diane gets up and closes the basement door.   You did it at your house?  Your own house?   In love?   But you haven't written your novel.   Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend.  What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.  Dave draws a heavy sigh and buries his head in his hands perhaps JIM has reached him.  Perhaps not.    That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.   I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.   I guess I don't have to tell you how all this turned out.   sits on the vinyl sofa.  CLOSE ON -- the small makeshift booklet whose cover reads, \"There's a place for us\" in overdone fancy cursive.  THE SECOND PAGE shows a cutout from a travel magazine of a swanky BEACHFRONT HOTEL.  One room has been circled with the words \"you and me\" written next to it.  Below: \"A time and place for us.\"  We HEAR Walt clearing his throat, swallowing.  THE THIRD PAGE has glued to it a POSTCARD showing a couple hand-in- hand on the beach at sunset and reading, \"Maui is for lovers.\" Below: Take my hand and we'll soon be there.  THE LAST PAGE has a cutout of a bouquet of flowers.  It reads, \"Tracy, See you in paradise?  Love, your 'teacher' David.  P.S. I really, really need you now.\"  The booklet is lowered.   After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.   He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.    Tracy, still frozen, THAWS OUT. Maybe now she can finish   Okay.  We'll pick up here next time  Tracy is miffed as she puts her things away: slam, stuff, zip. She slings her backpack over her shoulder and heads toward the door.  She looks back at --  MR. MCALLISTER who himself now FREEZES as he talks to a couple of students   Hey, that's super   You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.    Right  He cursorily flips through the bound pages and offers them back to Tracy.   Looks good to me.   NO, that's fine   Okay, fine. Sure  JIM throws his briefcase and Tracy's folder into the backseat.   You bet.  Tracy stays put as JIM climbs in, shuts the door and fastens his seat belt.   Should be easy.  So far no competition.   Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy  They exchange a long, curious stare.  There's a tone at once confrontational and vaguely sexual about this moment.   Sure   Good luck, Tracy.  JIM pulls away and heads for the parking lot exit.    JIM drives stone-faced, unblinking. Something about the music on the radio mocks him.   I don't blame Tracy for what happened with Dave. How could I? Dave was an adult more than twice her age.   Sure, she got on my nerves once in a while, but I admired Tracy. I really did.  INSIDE THE DUMPSTER we see Tracy's little bound book of signatures.   Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.   Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school.    Paul.   Paul, could I talk to you for a minute?   Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.   I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.   But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.   Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?  Paul furrows his brow and looks around, searching for an answer.  His lower lip is wet.   Student... council... president.  It takes a moment for this to sink in.  Finally   Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.   Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.   Paul, what's your favorite fruit?   takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.   Okay, let's say   Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.   Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.   Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.   He likes it.  Darryl's laughter suddenly turns into CRYING   Diane really wanted to have kids -- and so did I -- but it seemed like there was always a reason to wait: she had to finish nursing school, I had to get my masters, we needed a new house, we needed more money.  Finally we just decided to go for it...    A DIGITAL THERMOMETER reads 99.3.  Behind it Diane lies in bed reading a copy of Self.   ...but for over a year we hadn't had any luck.  And Diane was getting desperate.    At his desk, JIM studies a High Society magazine.  He is naked.  JIM closes his eyes and bites his lip as though feeling something he wished not to leave him.  He quickly replaces a stack of magazines in his desk and goes across the hall to --    Yeah, uh, just a minute   Yeah, just --   Sure.  JIM takes the bottle.  CLOSE ON the neck as the cork emerges: POP!   Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.   Here?   Okay.  Give me the drill.  JIM looks down at Sherry as she hands it up.  Her blouse reveals a bit more than it should, and JIM pauses to get an extra glimpse.  THE POWER DRILL BIT penetrates the ceiling.   I'd always liked Sherry, but we'd never had a chance to spend any time alone together.  How with Dave out of the picture, I began to see what an incredibly sensitive and giving person she was.  JIM downs his glass in big thirsty gulps and hands her back the glass. He watches her walk back to the house.   Plus she had finally dropped all that weight from her pregnancy, and really she looked great.  THE RIPCORD of the lawnmower is pulled a couple of times until it starts.   We got to be pretty good buddies.  I even took her to the mall one time while her car was in the shop.  JIM smiles and nods.  She puts on another.  Sherry is like a young girl on a date.  She grabs Jim's hand and pulls him in another direction.  AT THE MAKEUP COUNTER - Sherry spreads on lipstick.   You look great    They're driving home.  There are packages on Sherry's lap and in the backseat.   Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.   So what do you think?  Should we get a room?   points at the motel.    JIM walks in through the backdoor. Diane is loading the dishwasher. They peck-kiss.   Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.    Yeah. No. I mean, you know.   Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes.   So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.   ... that is, until things started going all haywire with that damn election.  A distant DING-DING grows louder and louder. Everyone turns toward the source, far down the hall, and eventually TAMMY emerges wearing a makeshift SANDWICH BOARD that reads \"Tammy Metzier For President.\" Smiling a perverse smile, she rings a hand bell. Salvation Army style.  Paul is at his locker and watches Tammy go by.   Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.   As far as I know, they--  Suddenly LISA AND PAUL are sitting where Tracy was.   Anyone who gets signatures in on time can run.  And she got in just under the wire.  Nothing I can do.  Now TRACY replaces Lisa and Paul    Looks like Tim Kobza.  LISA AND PAUL again   Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.   Thank you, Jerry, and good luck. Again, Jerry is running unopposed for Vice President. So we'll move on now to the presidential race with three candidates running. The first in alphabetical order is Tracy Flick.  Tracy steps forward with a small stack of index cards. During her speech she flips the cards over one by one but rarely looks at them.   The next candidate for student body president is Paul Metzier.  Paul?  Paul awkwardly makes his way to the mike.   Though by no means thunderous, his applause clearly exceeds Tracy's.  A small cluster of jocks \"woof\" for him, shaking their fists in the air.  Paul manages a weak grin for his buddies.  Tracy shifts in her chair, her smile stiff and forced  Lisa smiles and nods at Paul from the bleachers, giving him encouragement and a silent reminder to remember what they talked about.  Tammy's eyes dart between Lisa and Paul. She shows no emotion, reveals nothing.  The applause quickly dies, and after a moment Paul remembers to look at the white paper in his hand. He speaks in a barely audible monotone, never once glancing up.   Okay, Paul. Now our final candidate for President - another one of the Metzier clan -- sophomore Tammy Metzier.  Tammy approaches the mike. There are scattered mocking whistles and catcalls.  Tammy calmly looks over the crowd, waiting for the jeers to subside. She makes eye contact with Lisa, who stares back.   Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.   I think that's a little strong Walt. Ron?   There's your culprit  He examines it from different angles. Both scrunch their faces   Shall we give it a name?   No, I... uh, didn't know that    Still clear?   We'll let it run awhile  JIM turns off the faucet and reaches for a towel.  Sherry offers him another.   Right now?   Three twenty-five.   What had blossomed between Sherry and me was too real, too powerful to deny. For the first time in years, I felt free and alive!   So as you can imagine, my thoughts weren't on the election that Monday morning.  JIM takes a BOOK from the shelf   My thoughts were only on Sherry, on how perfect she felt inside. There was a special poem I wanted to read to her later, at the motel, as she lay next to me.  Jim flips through the book and finds the poem he seeks. His lips move silently.   Close, close the lovers keep. They stay together in their sleep. Close as two pages in a book That read each other in the dark..  Suddenly -- a grating VOICE from the loudspeakers.   Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.   What's the problem?   (his thoughts elsewhere) Oh yeah, you bet.   is inside.   Tracy. Come on in. And shut the door behind you.  She goes in and closes the door in our face.   I guess you know why you're here   A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.   Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?   6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?   Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we \"interrogate?\"   You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.   This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.   I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.   Okay, Tracy.  Have it your way.  There's a KNOCK.  JIM and Tracy turn to see  TAMMY METZLER timidly poking her head in.   Just wait outside. Tammy.   Possibly.  Please just wait outside.   Tracy, don't go away.  Come in, Tammy.  As Tammy and Tracy cross, Tracy speaks in a low voice but loud enough for JIM to hear.   So... what do you have to tell me?    What is it. Tammy?   Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.   And when did you do it?   Exactly when?   And how did you get in the school?   Which door?   I don't believe you.   Final  I don't know what your problem is, but if that's the way you want it, that's the way it'll be.  I don't have time.  You're out of the election, and I'm turning you over to Dr. Hendricks.  He throws the door open.   Tracy?   Looks like today's your lucky day  What does he mean?   You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.  It takes Tracy a second to figure out how to react. But once she's got it, she runs with it.   That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?   The rest of the day was unbearable.  I kept smelling Sherry on my clothes and on my fingers and I just couldn't wait to get out of there.  He yanks the paper out of the carriage and hurries away.   I wanted everything to be perfect that afternoon, so I decided to give myself a little time to prepare during eighth period.    Students are settling into their seats.  JIM breezes in, a sheaf of papers fucked under his arm.   Pop quiz, everybody  The class groans.   No whining.  If you've done your reading, this is an easy one.  JIM peels off a stack of papers for each row   I'd have exactly forty-eight minutes to make all the arrangements.  JIM glances at the clock:  2:08   If you finish early, just sit quietly and check your work.  I'll be right back.  POOF -- he's gone I    With feigned coolness, he saunters into class just as the BELL RINGS.   Okay, everybody, pass them forward. Stephanie, put down your pen.  The class begins to rise.   I'll see you all on Wednesday. And don't forget to vote tomorrow.  FROM BEHIND - Jim's back has a large vulva-shaped patch of SWEAT    JIM checks his watch: 3:24 turns into 3:25  Bingo   Sherry I  He rears back and aims his yell toward the second floor.   Sherry I It's Jim!  No response. He tries the door. It's locked. JIM cranes his neck for a last look at the house. As he starts to leave, he calls out one final time, not really expecting a response.   Sherry  Suddenly A WASP STINGS him above his right EYE   Oww! Fuck! Jesus fuck!  Cursing and holding his head, JIM stumbles out the gate   By any chance, has a woman shown up in the last half-hour or so?  Maybe she was looking for me.   Are you sure?   Sherry, it's me.  Are you there? Pick up.  Okay, it's 4:32.  I came by at 3:25 like we said and waited, but you weren't there.  Anyway, I hope you're okay -- I'm worried about you. So now I'm just at the...  at the place we talked about. Suite 219.  So I'm here.  Everything's all set.  You can just come over.  Can't wait. Okay.  Bye.    JIM'S car pulls into the driveway.    JIM enters the back door and sets his satchel down in the usual place. He opens the refrigerator, grabs a beer.  As he closes the door, something catches his eye.  He reaches inside and throws a plastic container away.  Rooting around noisily, he finds other things to dispose of.  Suddenly --  A BABY CRY stops him cold.  JIM stiffens, his good eye widening as the horrible truth sinks in. He carefully closes the refrigerator and tiptoes toward the living room.    Okay  He turns to leave, and nobody stops him.    JIM wanders out the front door and stands in his driveway, bewildered and alone.  The camera slowly CRANES UP, eventually looking down on him from a great height.   As I walked out of my home that evening, unsure if I'd ever return, my entire life in question, I somehow discovered within myself a place of perfect peace.   Oddly, in my solitude I felt more than ever a sense of communion with every human being - past, present and future.  Because no matter what we tell ourselves, no matter what illusions of friendship and family we create, each of us is always and forever profoundly alone.    JIM sits parked outside of Sherry's house, a SLURPEE held against his now grotesquely swollen eye.  He is so tired and pain-ridden that he practically gasps for breath.   Sherry never came home that night.  I know, because I spent the entire night in her driveway.    Reclined in his car seat, mouth open as he sleeps, JIM is awakened by the truck. His breath steams. His eye has turned bluish. He tries to wipe the condensation from the windshield, but it's on the outside.   I had no choice but to go home. I needed to shower, get fresh clothes, explain what I could to Diane.  But what was I going to say?  That our marriage had become a charade?  That making love with Sherry had given me a vision of a better life?  THE TAILPIPE finally coughs out a cloud of exhaust    JIM drives, bleary-eyed.  He creeps along his tree-lined middle-class block.   Then again, maybe I could slip in and out without waking her up.  JIM slows to a stop, looks with dread at his home    On the front porch sits A GYM BAG.  JIM approaches, stares numbly at the bag.  Drawing a long breath, he bends over and picks it up. Attached is a NOTE reading:   \"Don't come in.\"   Cupcakes.  Jesus Christ.  Cupcakes? My life was crumbling, and I was expected to care about these ungrateful kids and their pathetic little dreams.  As if my only purpose in life were to serve them.    Mr. McAllister.  Mr. McAllister. Somebody tore down my posters. It's not fair.  It's not fair. Can I have an A? Can I have a recommendation?  Can I? Can I?  AT THE MIRROR JIM adjusts his tie, tries to smooth his wrinkled shirt.   Well, fuck them.  Didn't I have my own life?  Didn't I have my own dreams?  He coughs up phlegm and spits it into the sink   Cupcakes   (putting on a smile Oh, yeah. Big day.   Are you there?  Sherry, are you there? It's Jim.  Why did you do that?  I trusted you. Completely.  You've ruined my life. Do you know that?  Do you realize that? Huh?  Do you?  You've ruined Diane's life.  You ruined my life.  is that what you wanted?  I'm sorry.  It's just... I'm going nuts here.  Okay, all right, so... Really, I'm sorry.  I just think we should talk, okay?  I love you.   If only my own life could be corrected so easily, with nice fat black lines drawn neatly through my sins.    JIM is hunkered over his desk.  He's a wreck: dark, dark circles under his eyes;  his hair didn't dry right -- frizzy here, matted there. And he's near tears.  Larry Fouch and his retinue enter cheerfully   What?  Right.  So let's start counting.   Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.   Right.  I know.  JIM proceeds to sort through his cluttered desk drawers but can't seem to find the key.  The council members exchange concerned looks as Jim's search becomes frenzied.   I'm fine.  It's just a bee sting, a simple little everyday bee sting. Some people, they get stung, it's no big deal.  Me, I swell up.  Okay?  JIM emerges from the drawer wielding a VISE GRIP.  He goes to the box and TEARS the entire hardware assembly off.  Holding the mangled lock, he turns to the students, who look back STUNNED.   I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.   All right.  I'll be back   You're there.   Sherry... I love you.   It's the only true thing I know anymore.   A mistake?  That was no mistake.   Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --    What d'you got?   You're kidding, right?   Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.  Jim's use of profanity scares Larry, and he responds reluctantly   Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.  Jim-scoops up the three piles of ballots and takes them to his desk.    JIM counts out the last of the ballots, mouthing the numbers to himself.   I was at the end of my count when it happened.  I'd come up with exactly the same numbers as Larry:  Tracy had won the election by a single vote, 256 to 257.  I was about to announce my tally when...  JIM looks up and sees  TRACY in the window, her face exploding with joy.  She FREEZES.  We move closer to Jim in SLOW-MOTION.  What actually occurs in a split-second is suspended in time   The sight of Tracy at that moment affected me in a way I can't fully explain.  Part of it was that she was spying, but mostly it was her face. Looking at her, you might think she was a sweet, innocent teenage girl. But she wasn't sweet.  And she wasn't innocent. She was selfish and cynical and ambitious and thought nothing of destroying the lives of others to get to the top. who knew how high she would climb in life, how many people would suffer because of her? I had to stop her now.  Tracy UNFREEZES and darts out of sight. JIM glances at Larry. Larry is writing in a notebook.    creeps up from his lap and onto the pile of TRACY VOTES.  His fingers nimbly count two ballots and pull them off the desk.  JIM coughs as beneath his desk he CRUMPLES THE BALLOTS into a ball and drops them into the wastepaper basket.   Larry?   I think we've got a problem.   Mostly Tammy fans   He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.   It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.    Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -   If we could get started.  People! Once the winners are announced, we can all go home, okay?  The students quiet down   Some contests are so well fought that is seems unfair for someone to win and someone to lose.  I think that's the case with all the candidates you see before you today.  All of them are highly qualified and embody the, uh, the integrity we expect from our school leadership.  OS TRACY - Jim's voice momentarily recedes.   That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.  JIM pulls a folded paper from his back pocket   Let me add that this was an extraordinarily close race. It's my pleasure to announce the next president of Millard High School.  Tracy just can't wait.  Smiling, she STANDS UP.   Paul Metzier!  The crowd breaks into applause -- and laughter  ON TRACY - AS she sits, her smile belies her horror and humiliation  Paul begins his acceptance speech.  We cut alternately to a thrilled Lisa; a stunned Tracy, tears forming at the corners of her eyes; and to JIM, who watches the events with shifty eyes, his mouth dry and tasting of metal.   And now, for vice-president.   Could I get a...?  As JIM gets his warm-up, in walk the Metziers: Paul,  Dick and Jo. JIM notices them as they wait to be seated. He    wishes he were invisible.  As a PERKY HOSTESS leads the family to a table, Paul  spots Jim. Here it comes.   (extending his hand JIM McAllister.   Paul doesn't need any of my help. He's going places.  You should be very proud.   Just a bee sting.   Thanks, I'll be fine.   Oh, she's not a bad girl.  She'll come around.   Good school.   Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.   You bet.  The Metziers go, and- Paul slides in across from Jim.   Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.   Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.   Diane, I...  Diane looks at JIM in silence.  Her face reveals nothing, but there is a deadness in her eyes.  After a moment, she turns back inside, leaving the door open.  JIM follows his wife inside, closes the door.  The camera moves to peek in the kitchen window, from where we watch JIM and Diane but cannot make out anything they say.   I don't know how Diane and I made it through that night, but we did.  Our marriage had gone right to the brink, but in the end I guess it was saved by one simple fact: we truly loved each other.  So we made a commitment to begin the painful process of piecing our lives back together.  The worst was over; the mistakes of the past were behind us.    A WASTE BASKET peeks out from under Jim's desk.  We hear a distinctive rhythmic squeak, and a shadowy head appears in the window.  Keys jingle.  The door opens, and Lowell turns on the lights.  He approaches the waste basket and slides it out.   The next day held the promise of a new beginning. After all, what harm had really been done? No one was dead.   Hi, Linda.  JIM continues to whistle as he looks through his mail.   Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.   Hmm?   Oh.  Okay.  Still absorbed in his papers, JIM heads over to Walt's door.   You rang?  JIM stops cold. Walt is not alone. Barbara Flick and a bleary-eyed Tracy are there. So are Larry Fouch, Ron Bell, and Lowell the janitor. Prominently displayed on Walt's desk are TWO CRINKLED BALLOTS. JIM takes an eternal few seconds to absorb what is happening.   After Paul got the bad news, Walt asked for a few minutes alone with me. It was very simple, really. I offered my resignation, and he accepted. Very quietly, it was all over for JIM McAllister at Millard High - twelve years of hard work down the drain.  The door opens revealing that only wait and JIM remain. The office staff is hushed as JIM the Zombie Cyclops emerges into the office and walks somberly toward Miss Boeder. His voice quavers at half-volume.   Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.   Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.    The city passing by outside is another strange REAR PROJECTION. JIM grips the floating steering wheel and makes turns wildly out-of-sync with the background.   I don't remember driving home, or much of anything that happened in the next few days.  JIM lets go of the steering wheel, and it drifts away. JIM turns his back to camera to face -   There were news stories in the paper and on television, former students calling with their support, endless hours of doing nothing, thinking nothing.  A shadow falls over Jim's face, and a hand offers him a glass of iced tea. Grateful, JIM takes it, and looks up at -  DIANE, her head blocking the sun.   Diane stood by me through the entire humiliating ordeal, in a way, it sort of evened things out between us.  Diane leaves. JIM looks up at the sky.   Soon school was over, and summer stretched out in front of me as it always had. Funny how the rhythm of the school year remains ingrained in you for life. in mid-June we found out Diane was pregnant.   After two months of sitting on my ass and two months helping out at my brother-in-law's travel agency...   ...I landed a position at a Saturn dealership.   I never thought I'd end up selling cars, but it's not so bad. I like the Saturn philosophy -- it really is a different kind of company.  A FRAMED SNAPSHOT on Jim's desk shows Diane and him with the LITTLE  I'm just relieved to have a steady income now that there are three of us.   Actually, it wasn't so difficult making the transition from teaching to selling. It's like I tell my customers: my role is just to educate people so they can make informed decisions.  THE GLASS DOORS TO THE SHOWROOM OPEN, and JIM watches a satisfied customer drive slowly away in a new Saturn Twin Cam.   When I send someone home with a new unit, I feel a genuine sense of pride.   So that's about it.  Maybe I'll get back to teaching someday, but for the time being, I guess I'm pretty happy where I'm at.  A SALESMAN pokes his head in the door.   Oh  JIM chews quicker and wipes his mouth as he stands up, straightens his tie.   Hello, Tracy.  JIM waits for Tracy to lead the way, but she doesn't   So what brings you here?   Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place   Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?   Good for you.  Good for you  An uncomfortable pause.  JIM shifts gears.   So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?   Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.  Tracy turns right.  They drive a moment in silence.   Handles pretty good, don't you think?   Plenty of pep, too.   And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.   So Tracy?   Why are you doing this?   Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. .  humiliate me?   Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.   What's this?   I don't understand.  What's the deal?  Tracy looks deeply into Jim's eyes.   Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.   Oh, is this...? (thumbing through it God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.   What a surprise.   You'll be fine.   You will.    He looks at the yearbook. He looks at Tracy. He looks out the windshield. It's all so odd.  CLOSE ON THE BLANK PAGE JIM begins to write:  \"Dear Tracy,\"    </html>",
        "Dave": "Her pussy gets so wet you can't believe it.   She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.  INT. JIM'S BASEMENTDAY Dun-dun-DUN... Dun-dun-DUN  JIM and Dave are playing the opening notes of \"Foxy Lady\" through cheap, distorting amps. JIM plays bass. Dave plays guitar and sings into a microphone. They're bad. As in not good.  The basement is typical of a Midwest middle-class young couple -- half storage and laundry, half makeshift roc-room.    Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...  CAMERA DRIFTS toward the stairs leading up.   You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...  Dave's finger traces the rim of his frosty root beer mug.   Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.   I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.   What kind of person?  Dave looks directly into her eyes.   Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.   And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.  Tracy nods in quiet recognition.   I don't know.  Maybe I'm wrong.  But it seems like you might need a friend.    Dave drives.  Tracy sits in the passenger seat.    Here, get down.   Look at you.  He descends out of frame.    JIM is riveted by Dave's story; he is both horrified and titillated   Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.   Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.   That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.   You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her   I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --   (to Jim, whispering Look, I appreciate your concern. I really do.  But like I said, I got it under control.  As Sherry approaches them, Dave rises to take Darryl, the perfect father:  hug, tickle, kiss.   Tracy's Mom -- she doesn't understand.   But we're in love   Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...",
        "Tammy": "Two GIRLS are kissing on the bed. They are TAMMY METZLER and LISA FLANAGAN, fifteen and seventeen respectively. Lisa breaks away. Tammy tries to kiss her again, but Lisa resists.    What?    Tammy is still trying to comfort Lisa.   If you could just get out of your head.  Tammy leans forward, puts her palm on Lisa's cheek.  Lisa looks at Tammy as though at a stranger.  Tammy leans forward and .kisses Lisa's eyes.  Lisa jerks her head out of Tammy's hands.   Don't you fucking knock?   Paul, get out!    You dumbshit!   You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think that would be a good thing.  BACK TO LIFE - Tammy turns away from Paul in disgust and runs after Lisa   Lisa   Stop! Wait!  Lisa stops the car, rolls down the window   Where 're you going?   What...?    as we see the greatest disappointment of her short life break across her face.   How can something that seems so true turn out to be such a lie?   I mean Lisa and I were destined to be together. It was so obvious. Of all the people on the planet who had ever lived, somehow we'd found each other.   Lisa...    CHOMP-CHOMP-CHOMP Tammy eats an asparagus spear.  GNAW-GNAW-GNAW Lisa eats an asparagus spear  TAMMY drinks a big glass of water.  She giggles a little.  LISA drinks a big glass of water.  She giggles too.   I remember one time Lisa and I did an experiment with asparagus to see how long it takes your pee to smell. We peed a little every five minutes.  AN EGG TIMER:  Ding I Tammy and Lisa, very serious now, smell little Dixie cups   For her it took about fifteen minutes, and for me it was twenty.   Everyday I found some new way to tell Lisa I loved her.  Suddenly Tammy walks by, drops a folded NOTE in front of Lisa, and walks on.  Lisa opens it.   But it just seemed like the closer we got, the more she pulled away.   What?   So?   I know.   I don't care.   What did I do to make her change? What's wrong with me?  Lisa swings out of frame, and the swing returns EMPTY.    Lisa.   Sometimes when I'm sad, I sit and watch the power station.  Tammy lifts a pair of BINOCULARS to her eyes, sees THE POWER PLANT.   They say if you lie between two of the main wires, your body just evaporates. You become a gas.  I wonder what that would feel like.    Lisa's car speeds away, growing smaller and smaller. We're back at the BREAK-UP.  CLOSE ON TAMMY'S FACE as she stares down the street, unable to move. It  starts to rain. Tears roll down her cheeks, mixing with the  rain. very French, very sad.   I don ' t know what I did to make Lisa hate me so much, but somehow she decided to hurt roe. And she knew exactly what to do.   I had to do something.  I didn't know what, but I had to do something.   Who cares about this stupid election?  NOW there's something worth listening to.   We all know it doesn't matter who gets elected president of Millard. You think it's going to change anything around here, make one single person happier or smarter or nicer? The only person it matters to is the one who gets elected. The same pathetic charade happens every year, and everyone makes the same pathetic promises just so they can put it on their transcripts to get into college.  So vote for me, because I don't even want to go to college, and I don't care, and as president I won't do anything.  The only promise I make is that if elected I will immediately dismantle the student government, so that none of us will ever have to sit through one of these stupid assemblies again!  There is a sudden huge cathartic eruption of cheers and applause. Tammy has set them free.  Even cynical old Doug Schenken and his buddies join in.   0h don't vote for me I  Who cares? Don't vote at all!  The students go nuts.   Being suspended is like getting a paid vacation.  Too bad it was only three days   Hey -- I said lights I    Wearing headphones. Tammy DANCES to music only  she can hear. She happens to glance toward her door and notices a MANILA ENVELOPE sliding under it. She opens the door  and finds a startled Paul.   What do you want?   Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Paul smiles at the acknowledgment of his good deed.   Now could you leave me alone?   Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.   You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?   Okay.  But is this about the posters?   Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.  Tammy manages to squeeze in a naughty little smile before closing the door.   Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?   I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.   I did it.   This weekend.   I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.   Door was open.   I don't know. All I know is I did it I   I have proof.  She burrows in her backpack.   You don't know what it's like to grow up in the shadow of an older brother like Paul.  it's always Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul.  Never Tammy.  I'm only Paul's little sister.  You must be  Paul's little sister.  He's so perfect, and I'm so troubled.  I hate him!  I hate him!  And I tore down his posters, It was a horrible, cowardly act, but I did it,.. I did it... l did it... And I'm not sorry...  JIM watches her performance until he can't take it anymore he's got other fish to fry.   Dad, I     Dear God, I know I don't believe in you, but since I'll be starting Catholic school soon, I thought I should practice.  Let's see... what do I want? I want people to be nicer to each other. I want Lisa to realize what a bitch she has been and feel really bad and apologize for how she hurt me and know how much I still love her.  In spite of everything, I still want Paul to win the election tomorrow, not that cunt Tracy. I also want a really expensive pair of leather pants... and someday I want to be really good friends with Madonna. Love, Tammy    as it is blackened.  We WIPE with the motion of the magic marker to:    I hate it.   Please, morn.  Please don't make me go to Sacred Heart.  I beg you.   Catholic school was great!  Tammy and JENNIFER, a Sacred Heart schoolmate, are jammed into a bathroom stall.   I mean, the teachers kind of sucked, and they were supposedly way more strict, but you could get away with murder.  Tammy hands off the doob to Jennifer, who takes a huge hit.   The best thing about Sacred Heart was meeting Jennifer.  Jennifer looks at Tammy.  Tammy looks at Jennifer   All those feelings I had for Lisa were just preparing me for the real thing. Jennifer and I are soul mates, and we're never, ever, ever going to be apart."
