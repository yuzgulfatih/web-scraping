    "description": "In Detroit, Clarence Worley goes to the movie theater alone on his birthday to watch some movies. The gorgeous Alabama Whitman accidentally drops her popcorn on Clarence and they watch the movie together. Later they go to a diner for pie, and end up having a one-night stand. In the morning, Alabama confesses that she is a call-girl hired to spend the night with him, but she has fallen in love with him. In the morning they get married and Clarence goes to the club where she works to bring her some clothes. However, her pimp Drexl Spivey and his partner beat him up--and he reacts by killing them both. Clarence asks for Alabama's suitcase with her clothes and the other girls mistakenly give him another one, which contains cocaine. When Clarence discovers the mistake, he decides to travel with Alabama to the house of his friend, aspiring actor Dick Ritchie, to sell the drugs and travel to Mexico. He visits his father Clifford Worley and gives his address to him. But the Sicilian Mafia is the owner of the drugs and a group of killers is sent to hunt down Clarence and Alabama.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",
