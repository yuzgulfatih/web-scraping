        "Mackelway": "I dunno. What are they?  Mmm-hmm.  Oh. Thanks.  Ya run the plates?    What the fuck're you doing?!  You guys ever heard of evidentiary procedure?    Sort of a... stickler for procedure.  Hold it a second.  Smells like... clove.       Fran.  How's things back at the ranch?  I don't think so, no. I think it was pushed.  The look of the tracks. Foot-prints near the embankment.  What can you tell us about the other man?  We ought to work out some kind of protocol.  Interviews. Witnesses. Looks pretty silly, our talking over one another.  Trunk's ajar.  Huh?  So they can't blink.  It's a metaphor - to make certain the victim sees... or to make certain that we see something. Or maybe it's just a fuck-you.    You're not wearing your ring anymore.  Hello?    Would you mind opening them for me?  He was here... seven years you said?  I ran the name through our database, just to be sure. There's never been an Agent Benjamin O'Ryan in the Bureau.  Is that what you called him? Benjamin?  Can I see it?  Still, might be helpful.  Wait.  We're RUNNING, dashing between two buildings of chipped-adobe, hearing nothing but the sound of our own breathing and the thuds of our own heavy feet. This is Matamoros, Mexico, a shit-hole of a border town. Squalor and sin. We find a DRUNK MEXICAN TEEN. He nods: \"This is the place,\" and sticks out his palm.  Yes, Sir.  They assured me that they understood protocol.  Huh?    I'm sorry?  No.  Did you know him? The guy who used to stay upstairs. \"O'Ryan.\" Did you know him?  I don't...  Oh. I mis-spoke. No, he's not dead... You know him?  He ever talk about this? A circle with a slash through it?  Oh. How do you know?                 Sir? We got an i.d. yet?          'Scuse me.  It matches the faxes, Sir. Almost perfectly.  Only city where the date on the fax and the date on the map didn't correspond.  Fax lists the date of disappearance as August 7. On the map he's written \"10- 26.\"  Two so far. Female, disappeared from Dayton, Ohio on April 12. And a male, Trenton, New Jersey, January 5th.  But both bodies were found over a thousand miles from where they'd last been seen. One in Montana, the other in Oregon. Got autopsy reports on both.  No, Sir.  Huh?  I don't know.    Professor Daitz?  Patterns, repetition of behavior.  Is that something you believe in, Professor? Evil?  I'm sorry?    His, Sir.  No, Sir.    What was that music?  How?  I can't get a read on this guy.  Why is he sending us all this shit? I've got 800 pins in that map, 800 missing people. What's he telling us?    I'm fine. I'm clear. I just didn't think this could wait. Fran, this guy is trying to point us at something. Starkey's part of it. But the other two don't connect.  I'm fine! I just need somebody to think this through with me! He wanted to meet me. It's like he was interviewing me somehow. What is that? Then he kills Starkey. So what was he doing with Speck and Fulcher?  No. No. You come out. Get dressed.  I dunno. Somewhere. We're right on the edge of this thing.    It's fine. I should've called.  You were. Thanks.    Oh. There was one other thing: Did he keep any kind of chemicals around the house? Acids, that sort of thing?  It's nothing. Trace elements we found on his trunk. Any interest in chemistry? Maybe as a hobby?  Anyway, thank you. And thanks for the coffee. Next time I'll call first, I promise.    Sir...  (not going down without a  It was SPECK not his killer who was hiding something.  Thanks.    Yeah. You okay?              He really was FBI.  O'Ryan. He left his file on my doorstep. Fran, he was FBI.  I'm look at his whole history! Citations, letters of commendation, even his fucking test scores from Quantico. The guy was an agent.  Listen to me--  Shit! Hold on.  Yes?  Where are you?  Shit!  That was him.  Yes.  O'Ryan?  Who?  Zero's a myth. You made him up.  Do you?  Huh?    Huh?  Yeah. White.  No. Tell me about it.         Professional courtesy.  Is that... possible, Sir? An agent can just be deleted?  I couldn't understand it before - pushing Speck's car onto the state line. Makes sense now. He wanted to make the case Federal. He's drawing us in.  So we'd be paying attention when he found Suspect Zero.  Sir, profile the guy. He's straight outta Quantico. All he's doing is working a case, like we would. He's not kidnapping little kids - he's chasing the guy who's doing the kidnapping! Look at the map!  What if it isn't? What if there really is a Zero out there and O'Ryan's the one guy who's got a shot at him?    Sir? What if I told you I knew how to catch him?  And what if I told you that the way I'd catch him involved sitting in a dark room, with nothing in front of me but a pad of paper... until I'd tapped into some kind of... energy out there. The collective unconscious. Something. If I told you I thought I could target and  locate him, without ever leaving this building, what would you say?  Y'ever heard of a project called \"Icarus,\" Sir?  Agents, trained to \"see\" distant locations using nothing but the mind. They called it Remote Viewing.  Army stole it from the Soviets. The Bureau stole it from the Army - used it to track serial killers. Experimental program. O'Ryan was the first agent they recruited.  Voodoo, right? Pure Bullshit. ...except, it worked. It's how he drew this:  He'd never been in that house before. He just saw what was in there - the Bureau taught him how... same one that deleted him. Same one that's trying to catch him now... Does anything about all this strike you as odd?  They going to Denton?  But not you?  Oh.  Yeah. Why?  Are they male or female?  The autopsies.  Sometimes. The lucky ones get sent to Wichita Falls.  Friend of the Receptionist, missing for about a year now. I told her I'd let her know if the body ever turned up.  Her name's Katie.  Yeah. Last night. Kid named Simms.  What're you talking about?  Need an address on this fax line.  O'Ryan's in Greenville.  That's where Zero is. Lloyd Simms - October 26, '99. Karen Sumpter - October 26, 2000. Both disappeared from Greenville. Zero comes back to the same spot, once a year. Today's the 25th.  O'Ryan thinks so.  I've seen this before.  Same burn-mark. I saw it before but it didn't register.  I dunno. Almost looks too symmetrical to be a burn. They're autopsying her this morning?      He sent a fax from this location 'bout seven o'clock this morning.  Are your faxes programmable? Could he have paid last night to have it sent this morning?  Were you here last night?  'Scuse me.    You're sure.  So... he keeps the bodies in a freezer, then buries them...?  Thanks, Fran.  Just some coffee, thanks. Might hit the buffet in a bit.  Mackelway.  Surveilling. What're you doing?    I'm at the truck-stop we traced. Off the  I'll order some lunch for you. Hear the meatloaf's good today.                   Dammit!        This is Mackelway. I need a run down on a plate. Texas: Delta-142-Romeo-Victor- Alpha. Got that?    You okay? Kid? You okay in there?    What're you doing here?       Huh?  Sorry to disappoint you.    You know where he is?  How?  I can't do that.    Where's the boy?    Enough of this shit. Where's the boy?    Where's the Goddamn kid?!?!  Fine. Where is he? Where is he?!?!  Fuck you.  Where's the boy?      Tell me about Icarus.  Just... wanna know.  They all wind up like you? The other agents?  I'm sorry.     Can't bring you in with me. You know that.  Those faxes, the Have-You-Seen-Me's... How many of 'em is he actually responsible for?             It's his birthday, isn't it?  He comes home on his birthday.     Drive.      Alpha-4-5-2-Tango-Foxtrot-Alpha.          I'll take it from here.  Give me the gun, O'Ryan.    Okay. You made your point.  Enough!  Drop it.  Just drop it.  Put it down.  Get up.  Get up.  I'm not going to kill you, O'Ryan.  You saw wrong!  Stop telling me about my fucking destiny!  Open your eyes, O'Ryan! Here I am, standing here. I'm not shooting you. Doesn't that fucking tell you something? You're a guy with a skill. Period. They taught you more than they should've. I'm sorry about that... But you're not God. You can't see everything.  Put the fucking thing down, O'Ryan.  I'm not going to kill you!  Yes I do!  I can't.  I'm not you.  Sir?",

        "O'Ryan": "What's in the case?  You're always lugging that case around. I'm curious.  What do you sell?  Must travel a lot, huh?  Whole country, or just hereabouts?  How's your wife feel about it?  She must get lonely, with you gone all the time. Does she?  Do you get lonely?  Ya miss fucking her, Harold?  Did it myself. It's sort of a hobby. I've got more. Would you like to see them?  Tell me: those jokes about the traveling salesman and the farmer's daughter - are they true?    Really says it all, wouldn't you agree?  That's a matter of opinion.  There's a rest stop, next off-ramp. Pull into it.  Nobody wants your money, Harold. Just pull in.  Because I don't wanna do this at 70 miles an hour. It could be dangerous.  Mrs. Speck?  Just wanted to offer my condolences. I didn't know him well but... I think Harold was a much more complex man than people realized.  I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.          Hey, listen, I'm sorta new in town. Ya know where I can find a good donkey show?  Oh. Forgot. Wrong country... In America animals have rights. Don't they, Virgil?           (Some of the HAVE YOU SEEN ME's have arrived via U.S. MAIL. We see a stack of ENVELOPES in a box, each sealed in PLASTIC, each stamped and addressed to Mackelway.  Mackelway eyes the map, puzzling. Fran's right beside him. Assorted papers and leads fill this room, including photos he took himself with that Minox.   Yes?  Agent Mackelway. Come in...     Tell me, what makes a killer catchable?  Now imagine a killer with no patterns, no tell-tale fetishes, no rituals, no hidden desire to be caught. A perfect vessel of evil, killing without ever leaving a single meaningful clue in his wake... He'd be immune to capture, wouldn't he? Your task forces, your forensics teams - they'd be helpless.  As a citizen of the world, it's hard not to. Wouldn't you say? Evil is all around us, I think - a part of the natural order of things. Like gravity. Like wind. A vast black wave, corrupting everything it touches. A virus invades a cell, causing it to dysfunction. Perfectly logical. But did it ever occur to you that something may have invaded that virus, something capable of using it to mutate so powerfully?  Just because something's invisible to us doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Have you ever seen a fifty-foot shark?  A shark, as we know, will only attack humans if he runs out of food. But biologists have theorized that for a shark of fifty feet the ocean would be an endless buffet. He'd never run out of food, so he'd have no need to come to the surface. Consequently, we would never see him. Do you follow? We'll never see one. But that doesn't mean they don't exist. Hence Suspect Zero.  Some of my colleagues think I'm fascinated with evil. I think the truth is just the opposite: evil is fascinated with us. What better vehicle could there be for creating havoc in the world - what better instrument - than Man? We're vain, we're stubborn, we're deceitful, we have an imagination that is limitless in its perversions. Of course Evil keeps trying to harness us. Wouldn't you?  Excuse me.                Evening, Officer.  'Course. Is there a problem?  Sure.  Officer, I am carrying something that could be construed as a weapon. I'd like to hand it over, voluntarily, so you won't think I'm trying to conceal anything. Would that be all right?  It's a hunting knife, right here on my hip.  I was on my way to the woods. My gear's in the trunk. Would you like me to hand it to you? I don't know what the procedure is for something like this.  Happy to.  A fifty-foot shark.  Ya know, I used to be in law enforcement too.  Mmm-hmmm. FBI. 'Course this was some years ago.  Psy Ops. Classified.  Oh. Sorry. Just found myself wondering what was inside that truck.  Of course.  Read anything interesting lately?  I've found him, you know.  Zero.  Myths don't kidnap little boys. Do they?  Was she pretty?  I could hear her moaning, right under the Navajo chanting. Whole thing was downright tribal. What's she look like?  Fair enough. We'll stick to business: How'd ya like my old room?  \"Hope House.\" You were there.  Dyson re-paint it? My room. Did he re-paint it?  ...But you saw what was underneath, of course.  No. You tell me.                                                                           Well, well... Must be quite a moment for you. Congratulations.  Waiting for you.    Apprehend the fugitive, then call it in for your pat on the head.  I'll get over it. But I'm not too sure that little boy will.  The one from the Diner, in Denton.  I can find him.  Same way I found Starkey, and Speck, and Fulcher... and you.  I need someplace quiet - someplace I can concentrate... And your assurance that once he's located, we go get him together.  Then I can't help you.  I'm talking about uncompromised justice. No trials. No lawyers. No hiccups in a chain of evidence that can set a monster free. You of all people should be able to appreciate the value of that.  I won't be doing this much longer. Actually, this is the end of it. I've  come to accept that. But there is one last thing to--  Do we have an understanding?  Good. This is good. Sort of thing you'd never find in a procedural manual. It tells me I was right about you.  I know. But we have work to do first.  Don't pick that up.    Right here...  Are you afraid?    And the name we give that killer... is Zero. Are you afraid?  It'd be customary at this point to start praying. I hear a lot of that. Haven't seen too many answers though. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for another janitor to break in here and save you, either. You're alone.      I know what you're thinking: \"There is pain coming. Am I going to take it like a man?\" Let me put you at ease: You won't. None of them do. Men, women, children. They all weep, they all beg. They pass out, they piss themselves. They attempt negotiation: You wouldn't believe how many men have lain right where you're lying right now - grown men, with wives and children back home - offering all kinds of sexual gratification in exchange for a five minute reprieve. It's pathetic. Are you afraid? Then there's that moment when they realize there's nothing left to be negotiated. They're just mine. And they're helpless. And the look in their eyes, the level of surrender... well, it's almost pornographic. I put this mirror here because I don't want you to miss it. Are you afraid?  How about now?  Are you afraid?  Hmmm? Agent Mackelway? Are you?  Are you?         It's over now. Can you stand?  We really do have to go.  This is where he'll be. With the boy. Zero. He's coming home today. We're going to be there.  You're ready to come with me now. You've been in the pit. Stand up.    Please... I'm begging you.  Why?  There were five of us. In the program.  We'd come in in the morning, have a cup of coffee, talk about the Yankees. Then you'd go to your room, with your pen and  your pad of paper, always alone, and you'd try to lock in. Son of Sam. John Wayne Gacy. Ted Bundy. He might be driving his car, or having a beer or brushing his teeth... or cutting someone's eyes out.  If you did it right, you got all of it: The way it sounded. The way it smelled... Those people were looking up at you, begging you for mercy. It was like being God. ...except you're not. Because you can't do a thing for them. Can't make it stop. You're just watching, helpless.  They wired us into this current, the five of us: darkness, the pit itself. We were plugged right into it. But nobody taught us how to shut it off... We were just men. And we saw things men shouldn't see. Agony, torture, evil - and it never shut off. Even now, it's still there.  No. They're dead now.  They broke down. Then they opted out. Killed themselves... After a while, those conversations about the Yankees became impossible. Ya see?  We're here.  All of 'em.  Can't let him hit the Interstate.    Up.  Are you going to shoot him?  Shut up.        I saw us here. You did too.  Bullshit! If I'd made my fucking point you would've shot him yourself by now!  Or what?  Would you shoot me?     ...and it's why you are going to let me kill this animal. And then you're going to kill me.  I can't do that, Mack. I've seen all this already. For months now.  Every time, we're in this field: same wind, same rain. And you...  It's okay. I want you to. I'm begging you to.  I'm tired, Mack.  Pull the trigger... I'm not going to jail. Now pull the fucking trigger!  Fucking coward.  Some things are not up to us to decide. They just exist. They're inevitable. This field. This rain. This moment. It has all already happened. You know that. You've seen it too.  Shut it off for me.  Of course you will. I've seen it.      on that map. They call to me. I see their eyes in the dark - they're staring at me: \"How did you let this happen to me?\" But that's the thing about them - they're like pictures. They never blink. They just...stare, and always at me. That's my destiny, do you see? I didn't help them when they needed me and this is my penance. Fine. I ACCEPT IT. But I'm opting out now, ya get it? I can't stand this anymore! I wanna close my eyes for once and see something other than torture. It's not a bad start, Mack. We've made the world a little safer now. Speck, Fulcher, Starkey, now Zero. We've made justice. But I get some too. You have to end all this for me. That's why you're here. It's your destiny.    Yes I can! And you can too! That's why I chose you!    Look. It's perfect. Won't even need a hearing this way. You apprehended the suspect in the commission of a murder. Then he turned on you and you fired in self-defense.  These things are bigger than you - haven't you seen that yet? Destiny. Justice. Mercy. They're vast. We're just puppets!  You don't get to decide that!    Do it, Mack. Please. Please. I'm begging you.  Yet.",

    "description": "When Dallas FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway violates serial killer Raymond Starkey's civil rights during an unorthodox arrest, Starkey goes free and Mackelway is demoted to a remote branch of the agency in Albuquerque. His first day on the job, Mackelway investigates the murder of traveling salesman Harold Speck, which turns out to be the first of three seemingly random killings. Perhaps they are not random at all. The last to die is Mackelway's nemesis, Raymond Starkey. The assignment consumes him, his past mistakes haunt him, and his head throbs constantly as he tries to find the link between the victims that will lead him to their killer while the case becomes increasingly gruesome and patently personal. This does not go unnoticed by his unflappable partner Fran Kulok, who knows of Mackelway's past and the demons that afflict him. Like Mackelway, she becomes drawn into the labyrinth of chilling clues, all of which point to the enigmatic Benjamin O'Ryan. O'Ryan clearly has a connection to the murders, a connection he flaunts. Quite possibly, he may also harbor a sinister link to Mackelway.—Sujit R. Varma",
