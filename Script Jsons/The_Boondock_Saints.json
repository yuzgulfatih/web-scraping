How many?  Yeah. Just tryin' ta break the ice is all.  Oh, come on its St. Patty's Day. It's all in good fun.  Guess you'll have ta change that tattoo now, won't ya Rozie!?         No fuckin' hot water man. That...  What's the matter with her?               Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.    Just called ta torture us did ya?  Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.  I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.      We promise.  All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?  Okay. Just calm down. Take it easy. He'll have his day. He'll have his  Thanks for comin', Doc.  How the fuck's he know that? We haven't spoken to anyone yet.  Listen Doc, we need a favor.      \"What do we tell him about the guns and money?\"        Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?  \"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan.\"        It was just a bar fight. You guys are fuckin' pussies!     Aye. Our mother insisted on it. French.    German. Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.  No pictures, either.  Aye, she can. Any way we can stay here?  Yes... he is.  ...so that which is good may flourish  Saints? I will not accept this pizzle until my feet have been properly anointed.  For what?  What?  Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?  Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.  What is all this \"they\" shit? This ain't a movie.  All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.  Nervous?  Me, too.  You and your fucking rope.    Where the fuck are you going?  No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds.  Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!  No, fuck you!  That was way easier than I thought.  On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.  Oh, we're good man.  I love our new job.    Right now.  Yeah, get a hold of yourself.  Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.  Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.    We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.  Who says that? You could take credit on it.  Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.  I can't fuckin' believe that just happened!       Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!  Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!  Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.  Hello?  Roc. You okay?  No. You sure you're okay?  Hello?  Roc. You okay?  No. You sure you're okay?  Hey, hey. Just calm down. Tell us what happened!    This is some crazy shit, man!  Ha! Ha! Roc, you got a jumbo set of coconut balls man!  You sure you killed them?  Liberating isn't it?  So?  Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.    Okay Roc, this is...    How?  We've teamed up with a sex offender.  We gotta come down here once a week and clean house.  Give the guy a shot.    Well he sure as fuck knew you!  There he goes. Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?  What the fuck do you mean?  C'mon Roc!  That's the guy that got us off the hook with the \"Checkov\" thing.  You bet your ass he will.  He's a good man.  We have to go now. We're on the lamb.    Ten minutes.  (yelling over the alarm  It is your corrupt we claim.  With every breath we shall hunt them down.  Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal.

        "Dolly": "How did you know that?  What's the symbology there?  Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.  Uh... two shooters!  So, what do we do now?    They were wearing masks.  Three.  Only two did the shooting. So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?  Maybe the three of them had something in common.  That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.  How do you figure?",
        "Vladdy": "",
        "Greenly": "That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.  Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?  Who the...    No way. You know how big a guy's gotta be to do that? Fuckin' huge.      But if you want to beat your head against a wall, then here's what you look for. These guys are scared like two little bunny rabbits. Anything in a uniform or flashing blue lights will spook them. So the only thing we can do is put a potato on a string and drag it through South Boston.  Why do you always disrespect me like that?      (as he walks to the door  Uh. Shit, I, uh...  Witness?    They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.  A couple of peons for the mob and...  What if it was just one guy with six guns?",
        "Duffy": "So what are you thinkin' here?  Let's go get a cup of coffee. You ain't gonna fuckin' believe this one.  We would be honored, sir, if you would join us peasants, in a donut.      He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.  New hitman wants to leave his mark  Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.  The Sicilians.  They shot him at a downward angle. They put him on his knees.  What about one guy with two guns?  It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.  No way they could have seen it?  Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.  A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.  Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.  Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.  What? That's it?!",

        "Smecker": "(stepping into the open   That's who the fuck I am.    Caf√© latte.  Twist of lemon!  Sweet-n-low!    Find the manager of this building. See if he has had any complaints of water coming down in any apartments, starting just this morning. If he's not there, knock on every door starting from the third floor up. Langley, you take this building, same thing.  Chaffey, Newman.   (points to the mountain of garbage  Chief, could you get ballistics down here and tell them they have to dig a 45 slug out of a brick wall.  ...and locate another that's been fired through a dumpster.  Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.  Look under the body.  You guy's ready for this?  This was no gangland assassination. Though creative, it was way too sloppy. Something went wrong here. This has personal written all over it. Now, these men were crushed and the first natural reaction the body has to such trauma is to tense up. So now the two shots fired here were reflex rounds. These guys weren't shooting at anything, but they were just about to.  Fourth floor huh? Then we're heading to the fifth. Let's go up and see just how right I am.  Really want to know?        I want A.P.B.'s put out. I want more uniforms on the streets. One thing's for sure, wherever these guys are they're hurting.  First of all, I'd like to thank whichever one of you donut munching, barrel-assed dip-shits leaked this to the press. That's just what we need now, some sensational story in the papers making these guys out to be super heroes, triumphing over evil. And let me squash the rumors now. These two aren't heroes. They are two ordinary men who were put in an extraordinary situation and they just happened to come out on top. Yes, nothing from our far reaching computer system has turned up jack shit on these two. All we know is what we found out from their neighbors. And the general consensus is that they're... angels. But angels don't kill and we got two bodies in the morgue that look like they've been...  ...serial crushed by a huge fuckin' guy.  Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.  Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.    Just hit the bricks nice and hard.  What the fuck is this!? This isn't a fuckin' tea party. Get out! Only thing I want in here is them.  This conversation is going to be recorded. Just answer to the best of your knowledge.  You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?  They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?    Know any other languages?  What are you guys doing working at a fucking meat packing plant?  What?  You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?  Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.  Well, we'll have to check with your mother, but it's ok with me if your friends sleep over.  Time to feed the dogs.         Uh,huh. Room number.  We got a time of death?    Uh, huh.  I'll be down there in a bit. Keep the press out.  What are you doing?  Cuddle?... What a fag!    Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.  How many bodies, Greenly?  While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?  So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.  The what man?  Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?  And the pennies?  That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men. Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.  The Greeks. The Italians.  Symbology? Well, now that Duffy has relinquished his King Bone Head crown I see we have an heir to the throne. I'm sure the word you were looking for was symbolism. What's the symbolism there? Let me explain it to you. In Greek and Roman mythology when you died you would have to pay the toll to Charon, the boatman who ferried you across to the gates of judgment. This made sure the dead came to atone for what they did during their lives, Detective...  Dollapoppaskalious.    I've seen burns like these before. They used silencers. Look at these entry and exit wounds. They're identical.  The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.  Excellent! Number two. Greenly.  It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?! They sure as fuck did!  And number three, Dolly.  Fan-fuckin-tastic!  Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!  Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.  Television,... television is the explanation for this.  You see this is bad television. The little assault guys creeping in through the vents and coming in through the ceilings. That James Bond shit never happens in real life. Professionals don't do that. So we've got this up here, which has novice written all over it. And all this down here that's simply a perfect textbook assassination. So here's our two possibilities. We either have rank amateurs that got lucky or consummate professionals that fucked up.  Join me in a drink, gentlemen.  With the exception of my coffee boy, you Boston detectives are starting to show signs of intelligence. So, I am going to make you privy to some information that you would not normally be. These men are all Russian mob. Not like those two peons in the alley the other day. These guys are all syndicate bosses and underbosses. I have a dossier on every man in this room. Since the Iron Curtain has gone down, the Russian syndicates have started to come here. And in the spirit of Glasnost the Soviets have opened their borders to the mafia. But the Italians, they're not convinced that the grounds in mother Russia are fertile enough for organized crime yet. So they ain't ready to commit. The Russians are coming here anyway. They are unwelcome. What we have here, gentlemen, is possibly the beginning of the first international mob war... unless I've totally missed something.  Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?  And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.  That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.  Can she I.D. them?  Of course they were. How many?  Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.  Probably shouldn't work another shift for awhile.  After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out. Why the two extra victims?  No way they could have seen it.   (makes a masturbatory gesture with hand  Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?  No. This guy is big time. These two are street-walking scum.  We got another thing to think about here. We got us a genuine Kennedy assassination style bullet theory. Two guns were used here, guns A and B. The guy in the middle was done with both. But this guy... ...he was killed with bullets from gun A only. And this guy... ...gun B only. But ballistics dug two slugs out of the wall from over here where the victim was done with  And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover? Theories.  What?    Who were the victims?      The shooter knew these guys, huh?  Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.  These guys were packing. Not one hand near a gun. It's simple human behavior. Someone you don't know approaches you, you put your hand on it. This guy's got his hands on the table. He's eating his food, for Christ sakes. They were friends.  These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?  Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.  Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid. God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.  Okay. Here's what happened.  They waited in a parked car down the street for the kid to leave.  They went in through the garage. The kid says he leaves it open when he takes his bike out.  Now, they know the wife is the gate keeper. She knows the code.  The wife says she doesn't know what happened after she hit the code. She just remembers going down. But, judging by the burn mark on her back, I think what they did...  ...was use a stun gun on her.  Now the guy knows a friend is coming to the game. And they know that this door can only be opened from the inside. So they wait... and when that door opens, man...  Nobody was ready for it. Devastation, panic! This was like shooting fish in a fuckin' barrel!  Now these guys dove under the table. The trajectory on the bullets show they came from straight across. So this means one of our shooters... dropped to his knees...  Something went wrong. Right here.  Now, one of these guys is a real sicko. He knew this man. He wanted him to suffer, to feel every second of a painful death.  This guy is one bad motherfucker.  I've never seen wounds like these before, but whatever he used on this guy, it was a blunt object and they took it with them.  They exited out the front door. And they had no fucking idea what they were in for.  Now they are staring at six guys with guns drawn. It was a fucking ambush.  And this was a fucking bomb dropping in Beaver Cleaverville! For a few seconds this place was Armageddon! There was a fire fight!  Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?  What is taking so long with those blood samples?         No. This is all wrong. David Della Rocco?     Yeah. Maria, this is Smecker. Could you find me the visitor's list for the day the MacManus brothers were in and read me all the names?  Okay, thank you.  Pour the drink, faggot-ass!  Okay... But I don't cuddle.    Oh, Christ, uh, I've never confessed.  According to the dogma of the Catholic church, I should probably burst into flames right here in this booth. But I've come here for advice, not salvation.    It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.  But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.  Yes.  Yes.    I guess not.  You're right.  I want to stand for what I believe in, father.  I believe these young men are right.  Yes.  No. They would never do that.  Well, the two Irish guys wouldn't. But the Italian guy, he might. He's kind of an idiot.  I'm beginning to see. I've been doing my job... well for fifteen years and it's just not enough. All the things I wish I could do, these guys are doing. Millions of dollars in tax payers' money wasted on shit like wire taps and surveillance. Theses boys go in and take care of it for the price of a bullet. Ww-what do you think I should do? Because I'm a law man.    Thank you, Father, thank you. Whatever. Goodbye, amen.  That's all you can give me?  So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?  I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?  Be careful.  What did he bring him in for?  Just for him?  Up where?  Oh fuck!  Joey Bevo sent me over. As entertainment.  You look like you could use a quickie.",

Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.  Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.  Nicely put.  Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.        Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?  Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.  He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?  He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance?

I've been waitin' for this asshole.    Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.  Don't worry, Roc. We'll do this guy right and you'll feel a lot better.  Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!    Look again for fuck sake!  Let the boy go!  Shit.  And he is one smart man.  This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.  He isn't to be touched.       Let him go or I will deliver you, right now.  Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.  I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.  We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.  I'll call you tonight, afterwards.    How far are we going with this, Da?  (yelling over the alarm  We do not want your tired and sick.  It is your evil, who will be sought by us.  Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.  These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.  For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.",
