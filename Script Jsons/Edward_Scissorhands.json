        "Esmeralda": "It's not heaven he's from. It's straight from the stinking flames of hell. The power of satan is in him. I can feel it. God, you have the poor sheep strayed so far from the path.   Don't come near me.   He has been sent first to tempt you. But it's not too late. You must push him from you. Expel him. Trample down the perversion of nature.   I warned you, didn't I? I saw the sign of satan on him.  You didn't heed my warning. but now you will because now you see it too. (Reporters approach Edward and Peg.   You see, I told you he was a demon.",
        "Joyce": "I could? I don't think so.   You know, on TV they say you repairmen are lonely bunch of people. Housewives get lonely too. Although you may not realize it since they haven't made a commercial on the subject.   On no! Who could that be? Will you excuse me for a moment? Now. Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. This is fascinating. I wouldn't want to miss a moment of it.   Why! Peg. Have you gone blind? Can't you see there's a vehicle in my driveway?   Well, I'm surprised you don't realize that means I'm busy. (Joyce shuts the door with a bang.   Yes, I'll be right there.   You are all hiding in there like a bunch of old hermit crabs.   Shame on you, keeping your unusual guest all to yourself. We think that's mighty selfish of you.   Oh, that was so sweet of you to want to correct the situation. What time does the barbecue begin?   Well, you intend to show your guest hospitality by introducing him to your friends, don't you?   And I will bring the ambrosia salad. What time was it that you said?   About five?   Did you hear that? He's the perversion of nature. Wow, isn't that exciting? See you later. Bye bye.   Do you imagine those hands are hot or cold? Just think what a single snip could do.   Who's handicapped? My goodness! Don't be ridiculous. You're not handicapped. You're... What do they call that? Exceptional. My name's Joyce. And I noticed that you have not tasted any of the ambrosia salad that I made especially for you. Allow me.    Sorry, ladies. But he's promised to come to my house first.   Haven't you, Eddie?    Eddie. Thirsty?  Kisses, Hush up. Quiet now. I can hardly hear myself think. Momma's precious little baby girl.  Wouldn't you like a nice cool glass of lemonade?   I was hoping for something big and bouffant. Kind of like mine. Don't you worry , Kisses. You'll be so pretty. Eddie, is there anything you can't do? You take my breath away. I swear. Look at this. Have you ever cut a woman's hair? Would you cut mine? That was the single most thrilling experience of my whole life.   Aren't you excited? Oh, this is just so thrilling. Wait till I show it to you. It's just perfect. It's just what we've been looking for. I want to call it \"Shear Heaven.\" Here we are. No, all along here I'm going to put a row of new mirrors. Back up here a whole row of new cosmetics.  All along this row here.   Sure. This is where I stand when I greet the customers. Back in here is what I really want to show you. This is the storeroom for supplies. What I need from you today is to help me make a decision. Don't, that's dangerous. You just sit down right there. I have some smocks. Would you like me to model them? This is my favorite because it's yellow. And what it's for is to catch itchy little trimming that fall down your neck. Then there's this old purple one, you know, you kind of drape around you like this.   You're trembling. So am I. I've been waiting for this moment for so long. Edward! Edward, you come back here! You can't do that!    All along I felt in my gut. There was something wrong with him.   I know, I know. They've got that teenage daughter in the house. Oh, those poor things after what happened to me can you imagine?   I don't believe it. They don't have him. I'm going! No! That's not a good idea!",
        "Kevin": "I wouldn't care.   Man, those things are cool. You know I bet they're razor sharp. One karate chop to a guy's neck...   Can I bring him to show and tell on Monday?   You hear that, Mr. Boggs?   Dad, look!  Sports announcements on   Edward, come here. (Kevin cleans Edward's scissorhands with water.   Hey, play scissors, paper, stone with us.   One chop to guy's neck. And it's all over. They're the sharpest things in the world. They can hack through anything. And...   You did it.   I keep the money.   You know we had a cool show-and-tell today. This kid brought in a box of baby possums, 10. maybe 12. Totally naked. No hair at all.   You dope, everybody knows he's supposed to give it to the police.   Hi, honey. honey.   No.   It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.   I'll be outside.   See you tomorrow. Call me, Right?   Who?   Help! Edward help!   Stop! Don't! Stop! Get away, now! Somebody help us! Help!",
        "Helen": "Weren't you just here?   My changing looks? That's good.    Come on, Peg. I never buy anything from you. You know that?   Hello.   Did you get a good look?   She didn't say anything. She rang my doorbell early this morning.   Oh, damn!   Or undo.   It could have been any of our houses.   I don't have anything against Bill and Peg, but...   What do you say to Peg about the Christmas party?   I lied, too.    Edward! I'm calling the police!   Yes, look.   He's a de... a demon.",
        "Officer": "We're in the process of deactivating the system so that you can come out.   Put your hands high in the air so we can see them. Put your hands up!   Drop your weapon I repeat. Drop your weapon. I'll ask you one more time and this is your last warning. Drop your weapon. If you fail to do so, we'll have to open fire. Don't make us do that, please. Drop your weapons. Drop them. Now. Looks like we got a psycho. Prepare to fire. (Neighbors gather and ask not to fire.   Alright, cuff him.    Will he be okay, Doc?   Character.   But will he be all right out there?    Listen. It could keep me up all night worrying about you. Watch yourself.",
        "Allen": "We're in the process of deactivating the system so that you can come out.   Put your hands high in the air so we can see them. Put your hands up!   Drop your weapon I repeat. Drop your weapon. I'll ask you one more time and this is your last warning. Drop your weapon. If you fail to do so, we'll have to open fire. Don't make us do that, please. Drop your weapons. Drop them. Now. Looks like we got a psycho. Prepare to fire. (Neighbors gather and ask not to fire.   Alright, cuff him.    Will he be okay, Doc?   Character.   But will he be all right out there?    Listen. It could keep me up all night worrying about you. Watch yourself.",
        "Bill": "This must be quite a change for you, Ed.   Sure. So what have you been doing up there in that big old place? I bet the view must be spectacular, Ed.   See all the way to the ocean?   Turn it up, Kevin. I can't hear it. Kevin! No, make it louder. Sports announcements on   No, make it louder.  Sports announcements on   I'll be darned.   Boy, it's just wonderful, Ed. My god, you, you have the whole family in there, don't you?   No, no, no. That's a terrible idea, son. Go to the garage and get the oil can. We don't want him rusting up on this now, do we?   Yes, it is.   That's right. Go on. Get out of here. Run!   Don't worry about her, Edward. She's just an old lonely loony. That's all.    Okay, everybody. Grab your plates. Soup's on.   What?   Yeah, it, it is shish kebab. It was a figure of speech, Ed. You got to learn not to take things so literally. (On hearing that, Edward looks back the time the inventor taught him the etiquette.   It's all right. It's all right.  Go back to bed. It's only Edward.  This way.   We'll have you a setup here in a minute. Up with your feet. A queen-size bed here. How do you like that? It's all made up and everything. There you go. What's the matter? What's wrong? She gets you nervous? You've been closed up in a way in that castle too long.  You don't know anything about the wonderful world of teen-age girls. They're all crazy. Here some. Straighten that out.   Lemonade. I don't know what it is. They reach a certain age. They develop these gland things. Their bodies swell up. They go crazy.   yeah, glands. I try not to think about it  Good. Isn't it?    Really?   I'll be darned.   Yeah, isn't that wonderful?   Well, he probably wants you to pay for it yourself. I agree with him. It builds character. You'll appreciate it more. Speaking of money, I understand you are not charging for gardening, Edward?   Sweetheart, you can't buy the necessities of life with cookies. You can't buy car with cookies. Am I right, Jim?   Veloro. Veloro. Sweetheart. That hangs on the dash board.   So, Edward, did you have a productive day?   Great.   Edward. I can't tell you how thrilled I am. I'm just as pleased as Punch. This whole beauty parlor, that's what's going to teach you volumes. There's nothing like running your own business. I've never done it myself, but from what I gather it's the greatest satisfaction a working man can have. So I guess the bank is going to be your next step, huh?   Yeah, take out a loan. Get yourself started. Nothing to worry about. With your talent and reputation, it's going to be a snap. Now.    What in god's name was going through your mind, son?   What were you going to do with that stuff?   Except trouble. And you're in a heap of that.   Well, we are going to try to help you find a way to replace the drapes and the towels, but our confidence in you, Edward, is not going to be so easy to replace.   Okay, a little ethics. You are walking down the street. You find a suitcase full of money. There's nobody around. No human person is in evidence. What do you do? A You keep the money. B You use it to buy gifts for your friends and your loved ones. C You give it to the poor. D You turn it into the police.   Edward?   Thank you, dear. Edward, we are waiting.   Good thinking, Kevin.   We're trying to make things easier for him, so let's cut the comedy for a little while.   We're not talking nice. We're talking right and wrong.   Edward, where are you going?   Well. I don't know. He just walked down the street.   All in the house. I'll take care of it. I'll go find him.   Now I got up by the Wiggmans, but I didn't see him anywhere.   Where's Kevin now?   Where do you think you're going, young lady?   No, you're staying here in case somebody shows up!   Kevin! Kevin! Edward! Get away. What happened? Edward! Go home! Go home!",
        "Marge": "You must try this.  It's my mother's recipe. Let him chew, for heaven sakes with your green thumb. I could use your help.",
        "Jim": "If my parents set the alarm, I'm screwed I'll sleep in the yard... again.   How else can I be the center of the attention? You didn't call your parents.   See you later. Bye.   Oh, yeah.   He's calling you, Kim.   Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for you.   Yeah, my dad bought himself a bunch of new toys. Big screen TV, CD players, VCR with four heads.   No, they keep things pretty much locked up. My father has his own room for his stuff to make sure I can't get and use it. He's so cheap he won't help me buy my own car.   Ah, that's true, sir. You can't. (Edward gives a piece of meat to Kim's friend.   You got it?   Well, we're stranded. (Edward opens the locked door with his scissorhands.   Ed, what a guy! Good job. Hey, you didn't break it or scratch it or anything. Hey, be a pal and yell when Peg pulls in, huh?   Sure, he does. Right, Kim?   Knock it off, bubble- butt.   So?    It was a little shock. Ha! Ha! Ha!   I wish we'd been taping that. I'd give my left nut to see that again.    Look. My parents have insurance up the rear. Okay? And all it will cost them is a little hassle. That's about it. In a week my dad will have new and better everything.   Look. There's a guy who will give us cash for the stuff.   Well, do you want to ride around in a van like Denny's, and we could be by ourselves whenever we like? With a mattress in the back?   Because my father keeps the damn room locked, and we need Edward to get us in.   Look, you don't understand, everything he handcuffs or ties will do anything for you.   Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?   What's fair got to do with it? There isn't any other way.   Look. I've racked my brain. Don't you want us to have our own van?   Those go on automatically. They've gone for the weekend. I told you. That's right.   Yes, everything, come on. Let's go. Come on.   Keep your voice down. I told you he stole it. Right? Come on. Let's go.   Listen, I've already tried that. The guy's parents are like he is. Okay? Now, you told Kim you'd do this. Well, come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. (Edward picks the lock and the door opens, but when he steps into the room the alarm works and the door shuts.   The bastard had it wired separately. Come on.   No way!   I'm not going back there. Okay?   No, because my father will prosecute.   Especially his own son. If Edward tells, I'll kill him.   No.   What's the matter with you? When you are going to stop? I did what I could. My old man think he's retarded, otherwise he'd still be in jail. What more do you want from me?   So could do. You were there, too.   But you did do it. I don't get why you give such a shit anyway.   Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out! Go. Freak!   He tried to hurt you.   Are you nuts? I just saw him.   Are you serious? I'm going to lose you to that? He isn't even human.   Forget holding her hand. Picture the damage he could do other places.   Yeah, that's sick. I feel like I'm coming to pass out, or puke or something.   Later, first take me to her house.   Come on, don't make me drive.   Just do it!   Jesus, maybe she was right about you.   Just drive.   Relax.   I didn't. (Jim fires at Edward and Kim tries to stop him. In their fight, Edward kills Jim, and then says good-by to Kim.   Hey! I said stay away from her!",
        "Kim": "Snuggle in, sweetie. It's cold out there.   Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.   Oh, not tonight. Go to sleep.   Well, all right. Let's see. I guess it would have to start with scissors.   Well, there are all kinds of scissors. And once there was even a man who had scissors for hands.   Yes.   No, scissorhands. You know the mansion on top of the mountain?   Well, a long time ago, an inventor lived in that mansion. He made many things, I suppose. He also created a man. He gave him inside, a heart, a brain, everything. Well, almost everything. You see, the inventor was very old. He died before he got to finish the man he invented. So the man was left by himself, incomplete and all alone.   Of course, he had a name. His name was Edward.   I can't believe. Everything's still sopping.   I told you to call to say we're coming back early.   They don't run their house like a police station. Bye. Thanks for driving, Denny. See you later.   Don't forget your arm.   Bill! There's somebody in my room. Go. Look. A murderer with an axe. He did try to even kill me.   Who is he? What are you talking about?   Mom, why did you have to bring him in here?   Why does he have to stay here?   I do have a little sympathy.   Shake his hand?   I scared him to death?   Hi!    I think they look weird. They give me the creeps.   Oh, no!   Stop it.   No, that's okay. I'll be right back. (Edward begins styling women's hair and becomes famous.   I'm home.   Hi! What did you do to your hair?   No, I can't believe this.  Do you have a key?   I could have sworn I put it in here somewhere.   Wow! Thanks.   Now you got him started.   Why are you laughing? He got hurt.   A little shock?   But that's breaking and entering.   We can't.   Jim, I don't want to.   Why can't you just do it?   Why can't you take the key like when he's sleeping or something?   What do you mean?  That's not true.   That's not fair.   There got to be.   Yeah.  Jim, the lights are on.   You turned off the alarm. Am I right?   I can't believe this is happening.   He's never been here.   No, Jim. We can't just leave him here.   Denny, turn around!   Jim, it's your house. They can't arrest you for setting off your own alarm. We'll just tell them we were breaking in.   We have to go back.   His own son?   Denny, turn around.   Turn around. We have to.   You're here. They didn't hurt you, did they? Were you scared? I tried to make Jim go back, but you can't make Jim do anything. Thank you for not telling them about me.   It must have been awful when they told you whose house it was.   You did?   Well, then why did you do it?   Don't.   You could tell the truth.   It wasn't my idea. You know I didn't want to do it.   Dad!   That is really stupid.   Hey, how about after dinner we go down to the bowling alley? That will be fun.   No.   Well, think about it, you guys, I mean, that's the nicer thing to do. That's what I would do.   I am being serious. It's a nicer thing to do.   Shut up.   More bells?   Mom, do you really think that we should be having this party?   Where is he?   No, he did not and you know it.   Jim. I don't love you any more. I just want you to go. Okay? Just go!   Just get out of here. Okay? Just go! Dad, did you see where Edward went?   Well, we have to go find him, mom?   What time is it?   Where are they? God. I hope he's okay!   With you guys.   Edward?   Yes, are you okay?   Out looking for you. Hold me.   Let go of me! Why? Kevin!   Jim, stop it. Get off him!    Run.   No, he's okay. He said he was just scared. Edward, I was so afraid. I thought you were dead.   Jim. Stop! Stop it, or I'll kill you myself.   I love you.   He's dead. The roof caved in on him. They killed each other. You can see for yourselves.    She never saw him again. Not after that night.   Because I was there.   No, sweetheart. I'm an old woman now. I would rather want him remember me the way as I was.   I don't know. Not for sure. But I believe he is. You see, before he came down here, it never snowed. And afterwards it did. If he weren't up there now, I don't think it would be snowing. Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.",
        "Peg": "Avon calling.   No, not since last season. Today I've come to show you our exquisite new line of soft colors in shadows, blushes and lipstick. Everything you need to accent and highlight your changing looks.   Well, it goes that saying and I also have a complete selection of your old favorites, those tried-and-true products we've all come to depend on year-in and year-out.   I know. Bye, Helen.   Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling.   Oh, yes.   Okay. Now, we should decide on lipsticks. Okay, dear, what one did you like best? There was the Winsome Wahini which looked charming on you. Or the Bahenie Bliss.   Well, great.   It's just not my day. (Disappointed Peg sees a mansion through her rearview mirror and drives to the place. She is attracted by the beautiful garden there and enters the mansion.   Oh, my goodness.   Oh, it's so beautiful. Hello?  Hello? Avon calling, oh my. Hello, I'm Peg Boggs. I'm your local Avon representative. Hello. I'm sorry to barge in like this. But you don't have any reason to be afraid. This is some huge house, isn't it? Thank goodness for those aerobics classes.    Hello. Hello. Why are you hiding back there? You don't have to hide from me. I'm Peg Boggs. I'm your local Avon representative and I'm as harmless as cherry pie.  Oh my! I can see that I've disturbed you. How stupid of me! I'll just be going now.   Oh my! What happened to you?   Uh, put those down. Don't come any closer. Just please... Those are your hands? Those are your hands. What happened to you? Where are your parents? Hum... Your mother? Your father?   Are you alone? Do you live up here all by yourself? What happened to your face? Hum, you know, I won't hurt you. But at the very least let me give you a good astringent and this will help to prevent infection. What's your name?   Edward? I think you should just come home with me.    Oh!   No, Don't be. You go ahead and look you have every reason to be excited.   Oh! Are you ok?   Here we go, dear. This is our house. And you can just go right in and make yourself right at home. OK? And just, well have something to eat or drink, whatever you... Here, dear. Here you... This is the front door here, Here we go, right in here.    Here we are. So, oh, this is the living room and back here, the bedrooms. You want to see the pictures? All right. Well, this is my husband, Bill. He's a bowling champion. Do you know what bowling is? Bowling? Well, here they are down at the lake, fishing. I think Kevin looks a little glum Because they didn't catch anything that day. And here's my daughter, Kim. All dressed up the junior prom. She's a senior now. I can't believe it. She's camping in the mountains with some friends, but she'll be back in a few days and you can meet her then. Isn't she beautiful? That's my family. Now, go on, dear. I'll show you the rest of the house. Then you can just freshen up and make yourself at home. Okay? That's the kitchen over there. You help yourself to anything you want to eat or drink. Those are grapes. Back here are the bedrooms. Let me get you some towels, then I will see what we can find to wear. You know what? I think I have some of Bill's old clothes in here. This is perfect. Here. These should just fit you.  Oh, no, no. Don't be alarmed. That's just a phone. Now you can go in Kim's room and put these on. I'll be right with you.   No, no, scissors. That's right. Well, he was born up there or something. Have you seen him before? No, I don't think he's been off the grounds before today. You're kidding. How did you get together with him? I have to go. I'll talk to you later Margie, Bye-bye.  I'm sorry Edward, I didn't... oh, dear. May I help you with this?   There you go. Oh, dear, you've cut your face. Let me get this right off. Does that hurt? Okay. No, good. Now let's get you dressed. Okay. There we go. Very fine. You look fine, just fine. Come on, we can't wait for you. You've got rollers in your damn hair.   Okay. Now what did I do with my sci... Edward, um, would you. Thank you. I have a doctor friend who I think could help you.   Yes, I can help with the scars. I just want to consult the Avon handbook before doing anything.   Kevin, it's not polite to stare. Think how it would make you feel if somebody were staring at you.   Well, I would, so don't do it!   I think he prefers Edward.   I was just...   Bill, could I have the salt and pepper? Thank you.   Would you like some butter for your bread?   Great.   I've had enough.    You think you can sleep? Things feel strange now, but soon you'll feel right at home. Good night. (Peg tries to cover Edward's scars.   The light concealing cream goes on first, then you blend and blend and blend. Blending is the secret. More concealing for you? But you complexion is so fair. Now this has a touch of lavender in it. Give it a try here. Close enough. OK. This should do the trick here. I have another idea. We'll cover up the scars and start with a completely smooth surface. Don't eat this stuff!  Sports announcements on   They filled the whole tape. (Peg listens to the recorded phones.   Edward, you did us? Oh, Bill. It's us.   Oh, Edward.    Edward, don't you listen to her.   Hi, Joyce. Hi!   No, it, it's... things have just been a little hectic around here. That's all.   Barbecue?   What time? Ah... bill.   I've always said that you really can't have a picnic or a barbecue without deviled eggs. They're just the best. They make the thing. Oh, dear. Edward. That's wonderful. I didn't know you chopped all those things. What a really big...  Oh, all right now. It's just a nick. There's no need to be nervous, dear. You know, Esmeralda won't be here and the rest of neighbors there are really very nice. There's no need to be nervous. They are so eager to meet you. You just have to be yourself.   That's right. Just your own sweet self.   He did them just like that.    Are you ok?  Do you want something to eat?  Are you hungry? Do you want a cracker?   Honey, that was Edward.   Edward's come to live with us. There's nothing to be upset about. No, no. It's okay.   Now you stay in Kevin's room tonight. Tomorrow we'll fix your room right.   Oh, honey, I couldn't have left him there all alone. You would have done the same thing.   Oh, my goodness, Kim. I'm surprised at you. He can't help the way he is. Have a little sympathy.   Then let's just say hello and later you can come downstairs and shake his hand.   Well, not literally. Goodness, you scared him half to death.   Hi, Bill. I just wanted you two to have a proper introduction. Edward, this is our daughter Kim.  Kim, this is Edward who's going to live with us.   Bill, you know what Edward told me? He had lunch at Jackie's today.   She's just had her kitchen completely redone.   New paint, new cabinets, new floors, new microwave, new Sonnet dishwasher.   Isn't that something? Jim, didn't you tell me your mom had her kitchen done too?   My goodness sake! I wonder what it's like to be that rich.   Now, Bill. Margie made him cookies today.   Honey, you want me to help you clean that up?   It won't be long. She has just to decide on the style, and then it will be fine. She just has to decide what style she wants.   We're getting the head of the company.   Hi, honey. We're in here.   Edward cut it. Isn't it wild?  Hello. Oh, I can't believe I'm talking to you in person. This is such an honor. Yes. He's right here. Great. So then you know all about it. Aha. That's exactly what I've been using. Well, I've had a little trouble getting it to the right consistency. Yeah, right. just a little. I'll try that. Well, what imaginative suggestions! I sure will. Thank you so much. Bye bye.  No wonder she's the head of the company. You know, she started out as a sales representative just like me. I've always wanted to talk to her but until now I never had a reason. Thanks, Edward.   You bet she did.    No matter what, Edward will always special.   I've never seen that.   Hi, Edward. Sorry. We had to go ahead without you. Here you go.   Wouldn't that be great?   You know. We already have a second on the house, but don't the testimonials make a difference?  Did you see here, the mayor's wife can't wait to become a client?   I can't believe it. Really, it's just an outrage. Don't you worry. This isn't the end of it. We'll get your money somewhere.   But can we see him now?   He has to stay in prison all night?   Oh, Edward. Hello Edward, dear. I blame myself.   Why don't I set a better example? You saw how I envied Jim's parents, their money.   Oh, I blithely say, \"We'll get money for the salon somehow.\" But I never meant stealing. Stealing's not the way to get it. Stealing's not the way to get anything.   Why ever did you do this?   Edward. You stay here.   He didn't want to talk.   He can't talk right now.   We have to get in the house. We don't want to talk to you. We'll talk to you later.   Well, for goodness sakes, Lois, I'll see you at our Christmas party. Before I get you here for your haircut. Of course, we'll have it this year. Why wouldn't we have it this year? Well, you may think that, but you're wrong.   Kim!   Simmer down.   You are not seeing Jim tonight?   Honey, this is fascinating. but I don't think your father's finished yet.   Oh, Edward, it does seem that that's what you should do, bit it's not.   Oh, goodness sake, no wonder poor Edward can't learn right from wrong living in his family.    Edward, do you want to give me that new haircut?   yes, sure.   It makes me proud to have you as my own personal hairdresser.   Other people's feelings?   A few manners? Just never you mind. Just you cut away. Cut away. It needs something else. What do you think, honey?   More bells. Okay.   Of course I think we should be having this party. Of course I do. I mean as just what we need is just to calm things down and then everything will just go back to normal. Do you have any more bells, honey? (Kim goes out into the garden and sees Edward sculpture an ice mass. When he sculptures it, snowflakes begin to fall, and Kim dances in the snow. After he finishes it, he cuts her hand by accident. Then Jim shows up.   You...your father will find him this minute.   All that blood, sweetie, and it's just a little cut.    Oh... Uh...   Oh, dear.   I'm sure your father will find him soon.   It's almost eight thirty. Great party, huh?   So do I, honey. You know, when I brought Edward down here to live with us, I really didn't think things through. And I didn't think about what could happen to him, or to us, or to the neighborhood. You know, I think that maybe it might be best if he goes back up there. Because at least there he's safe, and we'd just go back to normal.   Oh, dear. Oh, just... Well, let's get in the car and go look for him.   He's Max'es.   We'll be right back, dear.   Kevin! Kevin! Edward! Get away. What happened? Edward! Go home! Go home!   Kevin's all right! It was just the tiniest scratch! He's gone! Let's not bother him, all right? Let just leave him alone!",
        "Edward": "Don't go.   I'm not finished.   He didn't wake up.   Edward.   I'm-I'm sorry.   Are you ok?    Thank you.   Really?   Sometimes.   Thank you.   We are not sheep.   Myself?   Play scissors what?   I did?   I thought it was shish kebab.   I thought it was shish kebab.   Hmm, no.   What is it?   Glands?   Lemonade?     Kim!   I'm sorry.   She had some ideas?   No.   The friends I've made.   I'd like to meet him.   Yes, I know.   Peg could sell cosmetics.   I like that one.   Sorry I'm late.   Mrs. Monroe showed me where the salon is going to be. You could have a cosmetic counter.   And then she showed me the back room where she took all of her clothes off.   The bank?   This person stole from you?   His parents will make him give it back.   Nothing.   You are welcome.   I know it was Jim's house.   Yes.   Because you asked me to.    Give it to my loved ones?   Again?   Kevin, you want to play scissors-paper-stone?   No, why?   Police! (On seeing a police car Edward goes back to Peg's   Are you okay?   Where's everybody?   I can't. (Kim holds Edward and Edward reflects about the inventor.   Oh! Are you ok? oh! owh!   I'm your friend.   They are coming? Did I hurt Kevin?   Goodbye!",

The creator died before he could finish Edward's hands; instead, he is left with metal scissors for hands. Since then, he has lived alone, until a kind lady called Peg discovers him and welcomes him into her home. At first, everyone welcomes him into the community, but soon things begin to take a change for the worse.—FilmFanUK",
