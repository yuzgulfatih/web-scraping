        "Gracchus": "We have plague in the Hebrew Quarter and it is spreading... we have looting at the granaries... we have so much filth in the Tiber that the water is undrinkable... we have Praetorian Guard units that are demanding protection payments from the merchants at the exchange --   Rome dies as the Emperor plays at beneficence.  At least Nero gave us music!   It is his duty to hear the will of the Senate.  Their wagon stops -- hopelessly stuck in a massive traffic jam of chariots, wagons and sedan chairs.   Not to mention the damn traffic!   Darling children, to be sure, now if I may proceed?   Caesar, your presence in Rome is an invaluable opportunity to begin correcting some of the ills that have beset the city since your father went to the wars.  We would like to --   With respect, sire, the people don't need love -- they need law.  The Senate has prepared a series of protocols to begin addressing the corruption in the city -- (Gaius hands him a scroll -- starting with basic sanitation in the Hebrew Quarter.  If Caesar could study this and --   The Senate is the people.   Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?  Commodus stops.  Looks at him.  A lethal moment.   You want to hold games?   If I may, Caesar... how are you going to pay for this?   Respectfully, sire, taxation and import duties are the exclusive province of the Senate --  Commodus spins on him so quickly and with such feral violence that everyone is shocked --   No... it's not...  A beat.   He knows who Rome is.  Rome is the mob.  He will conjure magic for them and they will be distracted.  And he will takes their lives.  And he will take their freedom.  And still they will roar.  The beating heart of Rome isn't the marble of the Senate. It's the sand of the Colosseum.  He will give them death.  And they will love him for it.   We've taking a sounding, the Senate is with us.   But we are only words.  We are air. We need steel.   Well, can they at least be rented for a day?   Lucilla, Gaius is right.  Until the City Guard can neutralize the Praetorians we can accomplish nothing.   For you prince Lucius... a sea monster!  Gracchus gives Lucius a beautifully painted toy of a sea serpent.   Off the coast of Achaea they grow twenty times this size, with snapping teeth to devour any nasty Praetorians they come across... now, where is Achaea?   Show me on the map.  Lucius runs to a map and stabs his finger at Achaea.  We sense this is an old game between them.   You're welcome, Prince Anthill!  Lucius goes.  Lucilla shuts the door after him.  A moment. She turns to the others, a deep anguish in her eyes.   Peace child... One dark night the Gods will light our path.  They will give us the voice we need.  Have faith in that.  Have faith.   About half.  But once the tyrant is dead.  All.  A beat.   I want to meet him.   We should fear for the blackest storm.   I only have one question for you, General... Why?  A beat.   You will lead an army of your brothers on Rome.  Many will die. Why?   That's not the reason.  Tell me the truth.  A beat.   I knew the old man well.  And I loved him very much.  In our youth we would spend hours building that dream together.  After he went to the wars and lost his way... I was very cruel.  I tormented him to remember that dream we spoke of.   You can have no idea how much that means to me.  A beat.   Any man who will die for a whispered dream deserves my respect.  I honor you, General.  The drums continue...   General, the purple is yours if you so desire.  The Senate will support you.  Maximus looks at him.  And then at the people.  The chant of \"Caesar... Caesar... Caesar...\" is like a powerful beating heart.  Maximus moves to the edge of the Imperial Box to address the people.  The crowd grows silent.  Maximus looks around at the blood of the arena.",
        "Quintus": "These barbarians would rather drown in blood than yield an inch.  If I didn't hate them so much I would admire them.  They have reached the top of the hill.  Stunning martial preparations are underway.  The catapults join ten others. Archers are taking up position.  Brutal \"Scorpions\" -- devices for firing multiple crossbow bolts -- are being loaded.  Soldiers are also loading the catapults with enormous \"Greek fire pots\" -- large, round terra cotta pots.  Maximus and his lieutenants gaze down from the hilltop. Below them they can see a German encampment.   General, I don't recommend that. Our cavalry might be caught in the flames.   Now!  The mighty catapults are released.  The Greek fire pots arc dramatically through the air.  A moment later soldiers release the Scorpions and hundreds of bolts streak through the sky.  The archers fire a murderous barrage of flaming arrows.   That means after three or four more babies.    Highness.   General -- Maximus --   The Emperor needs you.  It's urgent.  Maximus leaps up and throws on a cloak, strides out with Quintus...   I don't know...  They continue on toward Marcus' tent.    Please don't fight, Maximus --   I'm sorry, General, Caesar has spoken.  They pull Maximus out --    I have no choice --  They are almost run over by a stern cohort of twenty Praetorians who gallop past.  Maximus knows immediately what this means.    They will greet you in the afterlife.  Maximus lunges at him -- the Praetorians subdue him -- slamming him with a sword hilt -- knocking him unconscious.   (quietly, to assassins Take him as far as the sunrise and then kill him.    Hail, Caesar!  The Felix Regiment responds, many unsure.    Don't speak of it.  Never speak of it.  He stalks off.  Titus and Gallus, concerned, watch him follow after Commodus.",
        "Commodus": "Do you think he's really dying?  The woman across from him returns his gaze evenly.  She is slightly older, beautiful and patrician.  A formidable woman.  She is LUCILLA.   I think he's really dying this time.  A beat.  Their breath turns instantly to mist.   He has to be bled every night now.   I've been so informed.  She arches an eyebrow.   If he weren't really dying he wouldn't have sent for us.   And the Senators.  He wouldn't have summoned them if --   The first thing I shall do is honor him with games worthy of his majesty.   Why have we stopped?    Where is my father?   Is the battle won?    My sister wants a bath, take her to the camp.  Take me to my father.  He leaps onto the horse and canters back to the Praetorian Guard unit.  Soldier #2 climbs on his horse and leads them.  Commodus rides off with most of the Praetorian Guard unit.  Lucilla peeks her head from the wagon.  She glances at the remaining soldiers.  Distinctly unpromising.   Have I missed it?  He leaps from his horse.   Have I missed the battle?   Father.  Congratulations.  I shall sacrifice a thousand doves to honor your triumph.   General, Rome salutes you and I embrace you as a brother.   Your Spaniards seem invincible.  May the Gods favor the Felix Regiment now and always...  Here, Father, take my arm.   She's at the camp.  She had no desire to see the gore of the battlefield.    He's dying.  A beat.   Poor old man.   Hail, warriors.  My congratulations.    My old friend, my father tells me you're returning to Spain?   A pity.  I'll need men like you in my army...  An awkward glance between the soldiers.  This sort of talk is offensively premature.   There are larger division that might appeal to you.  Even the Praetorian Guard.  You've never been to Rome. Imagine arriving as head of the Praetorians!  They have really splendid uniforms.   General Maximus, may I present Senators Gaius and Falco.  Beware of this Gaius, he'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear and you'll wake up one day and all you'll say is \"Republic, Republic, Republic...\"  Laughter.   You've had my ear since we were children.  You could be a valuable ally in the Senate.    There -- I warned you.   Not a word about that sodomite bastard.   I won't tolerate it.  His incessant criticism exhausts me.  The man can speak for five hours without taking a breath.    Enough... Maximus, I would like to inspect the Felix Regiment at dawn. Please arrange it.   Excuse me?    Of course, how foolish of me.  Some other time...  He notes his father being helped out of the tent by several body slaves.   Caesar retires early tonight.    I search the faces of the Gods for ways to please you... to make you proud... and I can never do it.  One kind word -- one full hug where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight -- would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years... What is it in me you hate so much?  My eyes are your eyes.  My hands are your hands.  All I have ever wanted was to live up to you. Caesar.  Father.  He stands.  We see that he is holding the scroll denoting Marcus' intention to nominate Maximus as Emperor to the Senate.  Commodus cannot control his tears.   Why does Maximus deserve what I could never have? -- Why do you love his eyes over mine? -- I would butcher the whole world -- if you would only love me...  Commodus weeps.   Lament with me, brother, our great father is dead.  I want --  Maximus, not even hearing, steps past him to Marcus.  He stands for a moment and then slowly kneels before Marcus and gently kisses the old man's forehead.  A ritual farewell.  A moment of silent mourning and then Maximus stands.  He turns very, very slowly to Commodus.   General, the Gods' have taken the great man and left me alone.  My first desire as Emperor is that you take my hand in friendship.  I need you at my side, Maximus, at this moment above all others.  Stand with me.  Maximus glares at him:   The surgeons say it was his breath that gave out.  Maximus glances to Lucilla, she avoids his eyes.   Take my hand, Maximus.  I only offer it once.  A beat.  Maximus turns back to Marcus.   Even as the Gods curse this dark day with clouds, so too does the sun begin to shine forth on a promised tomorrow.  Even as we mourn the passing of our father, so too do we celebrate the coming of a bright, new age for Rome.  At my side, brothers, you shall pull fresh glories from the heavens.  At my side, brothers, you shall know the adoration of the Gods.  Doubly-dark is this day because my friend, your noble commander Maximus Meridas, has been called to Rome to deal with urgent matters of state...  Titus glances quickly to Gallus, whose hand is bandaged from surgery.  They know this cannot be true.   Until his promised return I appointed Quintus Domitian to serve in his stead.  I salute you, Legionnaires!   Caesar is honored to accept your tribute, Citizen Scholar.  The child smiles and moves back to his fellows.    It is the most sacred duty of the Emperor to oversee the education of the young.  If I could leave no other legacy than the scholarship of all children my life would be blessed.  Tutors, you hold the future of Rome in your hands.  Teach them well so that they will bring honor to the Empire.  I salute you.  Commodus actually bows before them, an unimaginable honor.  The tutors bow in response and herd the children out.   Look at them, Senators... my truest gift to Rome.    Very well...  Commodus moves to the desk, standing over it and gazing at Marcus' scrolls as:   Peace, good Gracchus, peace...  Commodus slowly begins pushing Marcus' papyrus scrolls off the desk to the floor, one by one, as:   My beloved father was a careless shepherd to his flock.  I shall be a good father to my children.  I shall remain in Rome and show them how they are loved.   You see that's the very problem, isn't it, my old, old friend?  My father spent all his time at study. At books and learning and philosophy...  As Commodus speaks he moves to the chair behind the desk, tries it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave.  The chair is whisked away.   He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate.  All the while, the people were forgotten.   I doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, Senator Gracchus...  As Commodus speaks he moves to the bust of Marcus, studies it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave and the bust is whisked away.  Lucilla watches this closely.   I doubt many of the people have such splendid armor, Captain Marcellus. Or such fine mistresses, Senator Gaius.  No... only their true father knows what the people need.  I shall show them they are loved.  I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly --   No.  But if you interrupt me one more time I assure you that you shall.  I will emulate the immortal Caesars of the past.  I will give the people what they truly want. Starting this day I will draw all of Rome to the Colosseum.  I will give them bread.  And they will want nothing more.  Startled looks between Gracchus, Gaius and Marcellus.   Not just any games, Senator!  A series of games that will make the Gods envious and leave my children happy!  I will subsidize the arena from this day forth -- and I will culminate this celebration in a great spectacle the likes of which the world has never seen!  A great spectacle to honor my father! Magnificent, unending weeks of festivity all in the name of Marcus Aurelius!  A beat.   That is not your concern.  Gracchus ignores a warning look from Gaius.     Commodus sits on his bed, rubbing his aching head. Lucilla is preparing a drink for him, a medicinal tonic.   All my desires are splitting my head to pieces -- there's so much I want to do -- but all my efforts to show my children they are loved go unappreciated by those dragons in the Senate --   All I want is to be a good father to my people.  Why don't they understand that?  She goes to him.   I must take a firmer hand with them. They must know their father can be firm.  As our father was firm with us.   Yes... yes... you always know the way.  You were always so wise in these matters...  You know if I didn't have my duty to Rome I think I should be an artist. I should go away and paint pictures of the sea and leave all the politics to you...  A beat.  He is sleepy, he lies back on his bed.   Will you stay with me?   Still.  Always.  A beat.   My dreams would terrify the world.  A beat.    And after... just sit with me.  Keep me safe...  He is asleep.  She watches him for a moment and then rises.  She goes.   Slave!  Who are you?  The Colosseum is suddenly silent.  The Emperor is speaking to a gladiator.  Maximus keeps walking.     Why is he still alive?   He shouldn't be alive.  That vexes me.  I am terribly vexed...  Lucilla watches her brother cautiously, expecting the explosion.  He carefully moves some model pieces in the arena.   There, that's better.  Do you like the platform here?   I do too.  Simple, elegant...  Lucilla is growing more and more unnerved at Commodus' unusual serenity.   Father would have wanted something more ornate but he's dead now.  A beat.  Commodus laughs.  A beat.   Maximus Meridas haunts me.  I see Father turning away from me and gazing at him.  How many times did I suffer that indignity, I wonder?   I'm going to kill him.    Oh, you're too clever, Sister. Don't tell me part of you won't weep for him.   No?   He wounded you deeply, didn't he? Long ago.  She does not answer.   Nonetheless, your political acumen is, as always, unerring.  He picks up a model tiger and puts it in the arena.  He looks at the model tiger and smiles.    Commodus is wrapped in a sheet, gazing out a window.   I am sorry to have kept you away... I needed this time to think...   I limited my world to these four walls so as to let my mind free... again and again my mind settles on but one question... What kind of world are we making when the people of Rome prefer a slave in the arena to their father?  A beat.  Commodus' strange philosophical bent is unnerving Lucilla.   It is my responsibility to make the world as it should be.  How is it I have made this world?   They are not \"the mob,\" Lucilla, they are the people.  They are my children and all I want to do is love them.  A beat.  He stands before a bust of Marcus Aurelius.  He touches it.   Our father loved Maximus... and I love him still... yet he defies me, he tasks me in front of my children. And they love him for it.  Just as Marcus loved him for it.  Tell me why, Lucilla.   And what do I do but fight for them?!  I give them games to please them.  I strangle dissent to give them peace.  I empower the Praetorians to give them order. What more can I do?!  A beat.   Say I should fight him, in the arena.  Let my children see who the Gods truly favor.   A God is more powerful than a man...  This odd statement hangs in the air for a moment.  Then:   But I need to know -- why do they love him?   And for that moment in the arena they are merciful too.  For a moment... they are Gods.  Offering life.  He looks at her.   But who can be more merciful than the Emperor of Rome?   Brother... we've taken a sad path since we were children at Capri, have we not?  Maximus doesn't answer.   For my own part... I am sorry it came to this.  And to you alone of all men, I acknowledge my errors. And my regret.  I shall live with my sin for all my days.   As the first act of my contrition I offer you the wooden sword of freedom.  He holds out the wooden sword.  A beat.   Take it, brother.  Stand at my side as a free man worthy of your ancestors.   Take it, Maximus.  Let us heal that fatal wound together.   Will you always mistrust me?    You think this is power?  I could show you power, slave --   Where is my sister?   Where?   Where is my sister?   Sister... join us.  I've been reading to dear Lucius.   Yes, he's a very smart little boy. He'll make a grand Emperor one day.  Lucilla has not moved.   Join us, sister.  Lucilla goes to them, sits.   We've been reading about the great Julius and his adventures in Egypt.    And just wait until you hear what happened to some of our other ancestors!  If you're very good, tomorrow night I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.  He was betrayed!  By those closest to him... (he glances up to Lucilla ... by his own blood... they whispered in dark corners and went out late at night and conspired and conspired...  Lucilla looks as if she is going to be ill.  Lucius is busy scanning the scroll.  Commodus gently strokes his hair, his cold eyes never leaving Lucilla's.   But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something dire.  He knew they were busy little bees. And one night he sat down with one of them and he looked at her and he said:  \"Tell me what you have been doing, busy little bee, or I shall strike down those dearest to you. You shall watch as I bathe in their blood.\"  And the bee knew he spoke the truth, for the Emperor always speaks the truth.  And what do you think happened then, Lucius?    The bee told him everything.  Lucilla's face is tortured.   Why that's a bonfire, Lucius.  I arranged it just for you.  He puts his hand on the boy's shoulder.  Behind them, Lucilla sits slumped in a chair.  Her face is a mask of anguish at what she has been forced to do.  Two Praetorians enter with a bucket.   Oh... that's for my sister.  They bring the bucket to Lucilla and set it before her.  Commodus ignores her and goes back to Lucius on the balcony.  Lucilla glances inside the bucket...  Captain Marcellus' head is floating in brine.  Lucilla moans.  All is lost.    A castrati choir sings a gentle hymn of celebration. Their eerie voices and otherworldly harmonies undulate around Commodus' bedroom.  The Emperor himself is in a chair, wrapped in a robe.  His body slaves work over him closely.  He is staring into a mirror, lost in another world as the slaves carefully apply golden eye makeup to him.  The castrati hymn continues...    Rome... This is the day that was foretold.  This is the day when your father takes away all fear... (he holds up his hands With these hands I shall destroy your enemies so that you may sleep always and forever in peace.  From this day forth let it be known that I, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, have surmounted mortality.  That I, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, assume my destined place... at the side of the Gods.  The crowd is stunned.  A few scattered laughs.  Lucilla stares at him, disbelieving.   And as a righteous God, I shall ever protect you.  I shall cradle the world on my benevolent hands and clasp it to my heart.  So I have spoken!  And let the heavens tremble at my might!   This day I reclaim Rome for her people.  I shall give you the rebirth of your Empire!  Reborn and cleansed of her enemies!  He raises his arms.  At his cue the Praetorian archers raise their bows, ready, aiming at the victims.   I will make a new Rome!  Founded as it was at the beginning!  Archers --  As it was at the beginning so is it now.  The great She-Wolf of Rome will again suckle us, again ravage our enemies -- AND BRING US A WORLD  So it was for Romulus and Remus, sons of Mars, so shall it be for us! The great She-Wolf will --  Suddenly -- the huge wooden doors of the arena burst open and Maximus leads the Felix Regiment cavalry thundering into the arena.  The crowd is stunned -- Commodus is stunned -- Lucilla bolts up --  Commodus immediately spins to Lucilla, his eyes burning --  His Praetorian are momentarily confused --  At Gallus' command the Felix Regiment archers let fly -- multiple arrows and bolts cut through most of the Praetorians -- some confusing skirmishes as the remaining Praetorians fire back --  Maximus leaps from his horse and begins cutting the prisoners free --  Meanwhile, Commodus strides back down the platform toward Lucilla in the Imperial Box, murder in his eyes --  She suddenly hugs Lucius quickly and kisses him --",
        "Gaius": "We live in supplication to your glory.   Senator Gracchus is hale, sire.   Still eager for your triumphant return to Rome, Caesar.    ... And why not apply for entry to the Senate?   Are you a believer in Republicanism?   If your heart lies with the people, I would back you for the Senate. I'm sure Gracchus would as well.    The august Senator Gracchus has been rather a gadfly on the flesh of the imperial family.   He lives under the antiquated assumption that the Senate should represent the people with vigor.   He serves Rome best when he serves it with honesty.   Do you think he'll listen to us?   It's madness.   And what pays for it?  These games are costing a fortune and yet we have no new taxes.   No.   The Praetorians would only seize control themselves.   No Roman army has entered the capital in a hundred years.   We've been ordered to attend.   And what of the Emperor?  A beat.   One question... who is to be the actual Regicide?  A beat.  She glances at him.  The drums continue...",
        "Lucius": "Mother...  An eight-year-old boy stands in a doorway, sleepy.  He is LUCIUS, Lucilla's son.   I heard voices...    Senator!  What did you bring me?!  He leaps onto Gracchus -- Gracchus laughs and pulls something from his robe.   Below Macedonia!    Thank you, Senator Mountain!   Is it true you're a General...?  Maximus looks up, Lucius is standing at his cell.  Maximus has no idea who the boy is -- just another young fan -- but Maximus is immediately struck by Lucius' resemblance to his own son.   I saw you fight.  The Carthage battle too.  I've never seen so much courage.   My father was killed.  A beat.   He still comes to me in my dreams. Do you have a father?   I hope he comes to you in your dreams.  My father and I ride horses in mine.  These simple words strike something deep in Maximus.  Lucilla appears from the shadows and puts her hands on Lucius' shoulders.   I've been reading too.   She killed herself with a snake!   (still pouring over the scrolls I don't know, Uncle.   What is that fire?",
        "Proximo": "Those giraffes you sold me won't mate!  All they do is run around not mating!  YOU SOLD ME EUNUCH  How much for the lot?   For me -- 6,000 sesterces and I want to see their balls first.  And you throw in those two slaves.   Good teeth --  Proximo notes the many old battle scars on Maximus' body.   Where did you get those scars?  Maximus doesn't respond.   Are you a soldier?  Maximus doesn't respond.   Do you speak? -- (he roars back to a slave  My ass...  You throw in this one and we'll make it 7,000 sesterces for the whole lot.    All right, let's see.  The Slave Trader and his colleagues grab Maximus and bustle him across the market, unlocking his chains. Maximus has no idea what's going on.  In the center of the market place, a veritable GIANT of a man sits on a small stool, a wooden sword in his hand.  He is hunched over and chained to the ground by a ten foot chain shackled to his ankle.  A think metal helmet is riveted around his entire head, only long turfs of hair emerging.  His dim eyes stare listlessly through a slot in the helmet.  The Slave Trader puts a wooden sword in Maximus' hand and shoves him toward the Giant.  The Giant stands.  He towers over Maximus.  The Giant suddenly swings his sword -- he moves with remarkable quickness -- Maximus makes no attempt to block the blow -- it sends him flying to the ground.  Maximus pulls himself up.  The Giant moves in and hits him again -- Maximus recoils -- the Giant hits him again -- Maximus falls.  Maximus pulls himself up.  The Giant moves in again -- he slams him a few more times -- Maximus makes no attempt to protect himself -- he falls.  Maximus pulls himself up.  The Giant is about to attack again --    That's enough.   I'll give you 500 sesterces.    Come, don't quibble with your old friend.  I'll take the lions, the panther, the Numidian and this one for 7,000.  And I'll buy you the best whore in the town for two nights.  She's an enormous mountain of flesh who craves a stern hand.    Maximus and Juba are crammed into a wagon with about ten other slaves, including a very scared and reedy SCRIBE. Other wagons are filled with exotic animals, including several lions.  The wagons move through a crowded casbah and are taken through an imposing set of gates to...    An open compound in Proximo's school.  On one side of the compound is a series of cages filled with wild animals of every description -- including Proximo's two hapless giraffes.  Proximo's house slaves begin unloading the newly purchased exotic animals into cages as Maximus and the new slaves are unloaded.  Heavily armed guards supervise everything.  But Proximo's slaves are having a bit of a problem with one of the new lions -- it growls and resists them.  Without the slightest hesitation, Proximo thunders to the lion and grabs it by the mane -- manhandling it into a cage.    Slaves.  I am Proximo, trainer of gladiators.  You live and die at my pleasure.  Fight well and you will live.  Fight poorly and you will die.  It is better to live.  Slaves now toss thick handfuls of powdered lime on the new slaves -- they cough and clench their eyes shut, the lime coats and stings their wet bodies.   Here you will be trained in the art of combat.  Here you will be given the tools to survive.  Please my patrons in the arena and all the gifts of the world will be showered upon you.  Imagine riches beyond your paltry dreams of riches! Imagine fame beyond your rude understanding of the word!  All this can belong to the select few who prove their worth in the arena.  Slaves throw more water on the new slaves -- washing off the lime.   If... on the other hand... you disappoint me... you will be dismembered and fed to my jackals limb by limb.  He gazes evenly at his new acquisitions.   And my jackals are always hungry.  He strides off and the guards shove the new gladiators toward their cells.    Maximus and Juba share a small, filthy cell.  The cell door faces the open compound.  Across the compound they can see the much more comfortable cells of the \"star\" gladiators such as Vibius.  They both sit on the floor, leaning against the wall. Juba is eating a bowl of food with a wooden spoon. Maximus' bowl and spoon are at his side, he has not touched them.    Maximus and Juba are being observed.  Proximo stands in the shadows of the compound and watches intently.    Don't worry, noble Vibius, he won't be bothering you for long.  The Scribe begins to weep.  The crowds in the street jeer at the passing gladiators. Occasionally throwing trash at them.  A pack of children run alongside the wagon, chanting:   Some of you say you can't fight, you won't fight... They all say that... But one day you will pick up a sword and thrust it into another man.  And the crowd will cheer you and love you.  And you will love them for it. On that day... you will be a gladiator.  He stops at Maximus.   In this life, we all die.  All we can choose is how we die.  And how we are remembered.  Be remembered proudly.  Drums are heard from the arena.  Proximo nods to a waiting blacksmith.  The blacksmith begins slamming shackles on the gladiator's wrists -- chaining them together in teams of two by a chain about four feet long.  The blacksmith is about to chain Maximus to the Scribe.   No...  ... give the Spaniard to him.  Give the Scribe to Vibius.  Proximo nods to Vibius, who, for reasons we shall soon see, makes no protest to being chained to the whimpering Scribe.  Proximo watches the blacksmith shackle Maximus and Juba together and then strides off.   Make it 600 sesterces for each decapitation.   Two.   Done.  400 sesterces for two strokes.  In the arena:  Proximo's chained teams enter the arena, five teams. Maximus and Juba are chained together.  Some of the small crowd cheers for Vibius.  He acknowledges the cheers.  He is chained to the weeping Scribe.  In the box:  Trainer #1 laughs.   A Greek Scribe.    Give me odds, friend.  In the arena:  From the opposite end of the arena a dozen armored, very scary Andabatae thunder into the arena.  Some of the crowd cheers.  The Andabatae immediately race for the chained teams and the battle is on.  Vibius spins into action -- dragging the weeping Scribe after him as he circles opponents and fights -- the Scribe is almost instantly killed -- Vibius immediately hacks through the Scribe's wrist and frees himself, as Proximo surely intended.  Vibius is now free to fight alone, swinging the chain as an additional weapon.  Juba's eyes dart everywhere as he tries to move with Maximus -- Maximus neither helps nor hinders -- allowing Juba to pull him along --  Proximo, now that his star Vibius is safe, watched Maximus and Juba closely.  Juba fights well, with a strange elegance, his body flowing like liquid -- but he is inexperienced.  He strikes a few blows and then tries to move away -- finally he is in trouble -- cornered -- a huge Andabata is slicing at him -- it is a desperate battle -- Juba is losing -- his sword is slammed away -- the Andabata raises his sword for the kill --  And Maximus strikes.  With a sudden roar he EXPLODES into action -- he swings past Juba and blocks the blow meant for Juba -- then he slashes the Andabata -- killing him -- he pulls Juba after him as he fights --  It is a dazzling display of Maximus' skill -- he moves through the Andabatae at amazing speed -- spinning around Juba and protecting him -- slashing ruthlessly -- pulling Juba after him and commanding the battle -- Juba recovers a sword and they fight together.  In the box:  Proximo watches, smiles.  A gladiator is born.    I've wagered on you against the Celts -- ignore the others and go for them -- there are two axe-and- net and two long spear.  Now the Celts aren't used to the sun so you have the advantage there...  The roar of the crowd is growing, they are nearing the arena...   And keep them moving, their lungs aren't strong, ground the spears as soon as you can and then go for the ax-men.  If you get all four there's an extra bonus so don't be distracted by the Spartans...  Without a word to Proximo, or a moment's hesitation, Maximus strides into the arena.    A large mess area has been set up.  The tables around the compound are crowded with gladiators.  Guards everywhere.  Maximus and Juba enter.  Move to get food.  All conversation gradually drains away as the other gladiators watch them.  Silence.  Maximus and Juba note the strange silence as they move to a large table.  Vibius is at the table with a number of other gladiators. There are no places for Maximus and Juba.  Vibius stands and kicks two other gladiators off their bench.    Proximo sits on a terrace overlooking his compound, sipping wine.  Various gladiators can be seen working out below.  A guard brings Maximus.  Proximo nods for the guard to leave.    Butterfly?  The plate is filled with honeyed butterflies, their wings still moving slightly.  Maximus shakes his head.  Proximo pops one into his mouth. He chews as he looks at Maximus.   Perhaps you'd like a woman?  Maximus shakes his head.   Boy?  Maximus shakes his head.  A beat.   Gold?  Maximus shakes his head.   Well, I have nothing left to offer you!  A man who turns down a butterfly, a woman, a boy and gold confuses me.  Personally, I'd grab them all and then grab some more because the Gods are fanciful and take us at their whim.  Does the Spaniard have any needs?  Maximus shakes his head.  A beat.  Proximo studies him.   You fight like a soldier.  You have wounds like a soldier who has been on long campaigns.  You eye the world around you like an enemy. What is your name, Roman soldier?   And nothing more?   In two days we leave for Rome.  Maximus' eyes suddenly flash to Proximo.  He is transfixed, his eyes burning.   Ah... so it's Rome you want.  Well you shall have her, Gladiator.  The new Emperor has ordered a series of matches to culminate in a grand spectacle.  If you do well I shall become very, very rich.  If you do well enough I shall set you free. Is it freedom you want?  A beat.  Maximus shakes his head.    Not even that.   Oh yes.  He's apparently quite mad about the games.  Spending a fortune, which is, needless to say, good for me again.  But what is good for you, Gladiator?   As a gladiator?   One doesn't.  A beat.  Proximo sees that Maximus' mind is racing.   Except... If one has proven oneself in battle.  If at the end of the games you are the final man standing -- the Emperor will present you with a small wooden sword.  The sword is your freedom.   He did to me... (Maximus is surprised at this Our great father Marcus Aurelius looked into my eyes and touched me on the shoulder.   I didn't know him.  He touched me on the shoulder.  Just once.  But that was enough.  A beat.   All right, Gladiator.  We shall go to Rome together and have bloody adventures.  The Great Whore will suckle us until we are fat and happy and can't suck another drop.  That is Rome.    The slave wagon pulls up to Proximo's rather grand Roman compound.  Guards unlock imposing gates and the wagon drives in...    Inside the gates is a large courtyard, much like Proximo's Moroccan school but much more impressive.  A fountain with an enormous statue of the war god Mars is central in the courtyard.  The gladiators climb from the wagon, stretching after the long journey.  Vibius leads Maximus and Juba to the statue.  He wades through the fountain and kisses the toe of Mars.    Stop that!  You'll get some monstrous disease and then you'll be worth nothing to me!  Guards come and lead them to their cells, which line one side of the courtyard.    Later.  Maximus and Juba again share a cell.  It is more comfortable than their cell in Morocco, befitting Maximus' new status as one of the \"stars.\"  A high, barred window on one wall opens to the city.  Another barred window is directly over them, twenty feet above.  Maximus pulls himself up to the side window, he looks out.  And sees at last... The Colosseum.  It is a breathtaking sight.  Monolithic Albert Speer-like columns of light shine up from the Colosseum.  It seems to illuminate the whole city and the heavens above.  Maximus drops back to the floor.   No -- have pity, Cassius -- !   I won't do it for less than 100,000 sesterces -- !   I won't throw my Spaniard into a spectacle!  Damn you and damn the rotation!   I give you 30,000 my Spaniard will kill at least one of your Thracians.   Then make the wager, you smug bastard!  They disappear down a dark corridor, negotiating all the while.   All right -- there are three other teams, four men each --  You know what a Thracian looks like?   Ignore the others -- go for the Thracians.  The sun is to the east -- over the gate -- keep your back to the gate and you won't have the sun.   Hurry -- !  The guards quickly bustle the four toward a gate leading to a dark tunnel to the arena.   Die well and we'll sing songs about you for a generation.  Short swords are shoved into their hands and the gate rises.  They are pushed into the dark tunnel leading to the arena.  The gate closes behind them.  The four gladiators stand for a moment and then slowly walk down the tunnel to...    Maximus silently awaits Commodus' assassins with Juba. They hear footsteps outside the cell.  Maximus stands, preparing for death.   Enjoy yourself, Madame... (he glances to Maximus General, perform well and there will be riches for you.  He beckons to Juba, they go, shutting the door behind them.  The woman pulls off her cloak, it is Lucilla.  Maximus glares at her, his muscles tensing.   Gods!  That old Homicide!  The Emperor must truly hate you.   He cheats.    Maximus and Juba are with Lucilla and Gracchus.  Lucilla is writing on a piece of parchment.    Maximus stands with Juba and Vibius.  He draws a circle in the sand with a stick.  He draws a line to the circle.    Proximo sits, considering Maximus.   Captain.  A beat.   How did you know?   All that was a long time ago.  Too much wine and too many women.  And too much money.   This is who I am... (he pats his ample belly You see?  There was a time I would stand against ten men and never give an inch, spitting into the jaws of Hades all the while.  There was a time my heart swelled to strap on the armor of Rome.  But now...  Something flashes across Proximo's eyes, something like tragedy.   Now I am just an entertainer.  A pause.   Yes.    You might have spared yourself the speech, General.  The lady Lucilla bought all my gladiators two hours ago!   I am the richest trainer in the Empire!  And I will let my gladiators do anything you like! Conspire away, General!  Maximus can only laugh as well.   But I tell you -- if you survive this madness I want you to go into business with me.  I'll give you a quarter of my holdings.   A third.  And not a hair more.  And you'll have to start in the provinces!  Cleaning up the lion shit!    Maximus enters.  Lucilla is waiting, extremely tense.    Proximo is asleep -- a sound outside wakes him -- the steady clip-clop of horses on stone.  A lot of horses.  He rises and goes to a window overlooking the street outside.  A stern Praetorian Guard cavalry unit is cantering into position at his gates.  Proximo grabs his clothes --    With cool military precision the Praetorians take up position at the gates before Proximo's compound, an unassailable line.  They quickly prepare their bows.  Meanwhile, another Praetorian unit has taken up position at the other end of Proximo's compound -- sealing that entrance as well.    Proximo is hurrying across his open courtyard when the first flaming arrow arches into the compound -- it is followed by hundreds more --  The Praetorians on either end of his compound keep up a ceaseless hail of flaming arrows -- everything begins to burn -- the caged gladiators are stirring now -- shouting --  Proximo races to his panicked guards --   Release them!  Release them all!  Come --   If you want to live -- follow me --   All the old gladiator schools have tunnels to the Colosseum -- most have long since collapsed --   Quickly --  He leads Maximus down the disintegrating catacomb of tunnels --    Vibius hoped to die fighting -- he never got the chance.  It is not a battle, it is a slaughter.  The Praetorians ruthlessly shoot anyone even approaching the gates -- all the walls are covered -- most of the gladiators die in the hellish inferno -- the relentless rain of flaming arrows continues --  Vibius coughs in the thick smoke and rages for someone to fight -- Praetorian snipers cut him down -- he dies reaching for the statue of Mars.    Down that corridor is the butchery -- the blood sloughs lead to the Tiber.  Gods watch over you.   They are killing my men!  He races back into the tunnel.  Maximus moves quickly down the corridor.  He can finally see...   Gods... they're killing them all.  Proximo leads them up a cramped stairway to...    They emerge through a sewer entrance -- right into the arms of the Praetorian Guard.  Proximo and Juba are bound. Proximo sees his compound burning.  Sees the Praetorian archers taking out any last survivors.  Hears the screams.   This way!  They race across the arena and into a tunnel...",
        "Marcus": "Maximus, you prove your valor again. Let us hope for the final time here.   There are always people left to fight...  Marcus takes Maximus' arm and they walk through the masses of bodies.  Maximus holds Marcus' arm firmly, quietly supporting him as they walk.   But this night, at least, Germania is at last defeated... What will you do now, my friend?    Stop...  ... You speak our language?   No.  Let him speak...  ... I am Rome, what would you say to me?   Now it is Rome.   No... Release him.  Give him safe passage.  Let him go to his family.  The soldier leads the German Prisoner away.  Maximus and Marcus continue walking in silence for a beat. Then:   Tell me again, Maximus, why are we here?    Yes.  I remember.  They continue walking through the mountains of bodies...   I don't think they're standing for me, Maximus.  They honor you.  Just then Commodus canters into view with his Praetorian Guard escort.  He watches the army honor Maximus with rank envy as he nears.  He rides up to Maximus and Marcus.   You've missed the war.  We're done here.  Commodus embraces him, awkward.   Spare the doves and honor Maximus, he won the battle.  Commodus embraces Maximus, even more awkward.    Where's your sister?    Lucilla would eat every corpse here if it brought her one step closer to the throne.  Maximus laughs.   It's a foolish old cobra who doesn't recognize his own off-spring... (he suddenly stops, not feeling well I think... I should ride now.  Maximus waves for Marcus' horse.  It is brought up. Several soldiers carefully help the old man into the saddle.  He is then tethered to the brace on his saddle. It is a slow, graceful and embarrassing ordeal for the Emperor of Rome.  When at last he is strapped in, he looks to Maximus.   So much for the glory of Rome.  Without a word to his son, Marcus nods and the horse is slowly lead away.  Commodus and Maximus watch him go.   Stand up, Senators.  That unfamiliar posture doesn't suit you.   All the while conspiring with that fat man in Rome.  How is the old monster?   Still damning me to the four winds?   I would have silenced him decades ago -- but I just like him too much.  Meanwhile, Maximus stands with his lieutenants, Titus and Quintus.  A wound on Maximus' arm has been bound.   If only you had been born a man...  She turns to him.  He leaves his body slaves and goes to her.   What a Caesar you would have made.   I think you would have been strong. I wonder if you would have been just?   Well, pretend to be my loving daughter tonight and walk with me to my chamber.  She smiles and takes his arm.  They slowly walk down the tent corridor as:   This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?  They disappear into darkness.    Maximus enters Marcus' darkened tent.  Flickering braziers provide the only light in the enormous Imperial tent. Heavy beams support the canopy and they creak like the timbers of a ship as the tent sways slightly in the wind.  Marcus stands before a map of the Roman Empire.   Read this.   Of course.  No matter.  In this letter I denote my intention to nominate you to stand for the Emperorship after my death.  A stunned pause.  Maximus stares at him.   My son is not a moral man.  You have known this since you were young.  He cannot rule.   For twenty years I have been spilling blood.  For twenty years I have written philosophy and ruminated and conquered.  Since I became Caesar I have only had four years without war.  Four years of peace in twenty.  So perhaps I can be... forgiven.  A long beat.   While I have been fighting, Rome has grown mad and corpulent and diseased.  I did this.  And now I shall make it right.    I have brought the sword -- nothing more!  Rome is far away and we shouldn't be here.  What matter is it to the Gods if we subdue one more tribe of Parthians or Gauls?  What matter is it to Rome if a thousand more barbarians bend to our lash?  A beat.  Marcus sits.  He doesn't look at Maximus.  A pause.   Winter, Maximus.  It's winter now...  A beat.   There was a dream that was Rome.  I can only whisper of it now. Anything more than a whisper and the dream vanishes.  It's so... fragile. The true glory of Rome is in a very fragile idea.  Imagine a place devoted to the rights of the citizen.  Where every free man has a voice.  That was the dream... And I fear it will not survive the winter.  He holds out a hand to Maximus.  Maximus takes his hand, deeply moved, kneeling.   Let's just whisper here, you and I.   If the dream is ever to live again the people must have a true voice. The voice I took from them.  That all the Caesars took from them, bit by bit, conquest by conquest.  And now that I am dying I am going to give them that voice again.   I am, Maximus.  It's strange... I find as I near the end I think little of the waning moments around me... instead I think much of the past... and of the future.  How will the world speak my name in years to come?  Will I be known as the philosopher?  The warrior?  The tyrant?  Or will there be a more golden sounding to my name?  Will I be the Emperor who gave Rome back her freedom?  A beat.   Before I die I will give the people this final gift.  I will give them the Senate reborn.  The voice of the people empowered again, as it was always meant to be.  It is my design that they will elect the next Emperor.  And I would put forward your name with my backing.   You are the son I should have had... Although I fear in my deepest heart that if you had truly been my son my blood would have polluted you as it did Commodus.  We're a cursed bloodline.  We have lived so long in power and depravity that we no longer remember a life without it. We can no longer even imagine a life without it.  A beat.   Look at me, son.  Maximus looks at him.   Son... I know that one grove of your vineyard is worth more to you than all the treasures of Rome.  I know one loving word from your wife is worth more than the accolades of an Empire.  But... a fond old man, who loves you more than he can say, begs you to at least think about what he has said tonight.   I'll keep this letter to myself.  I hope that with the sunrise you will agree.  And embrace me as a father.  Maximus nods and rises.  He begins to go.  Stops.    Commodus' eyes are red with weeping.  He sits, head down, at the foot of Marcus' bed and speaks to his father.    Maximus and Quintus stride into the tent -- Maximus slams to a halt.  Stunned.  Commodus stands before him.  Lucilla stands in a corner of the tent, head down.  And Marcus Aurelius dead, lying on his bed.  Maximus stares at Marcus.",
        "Aurelius": "Commodus eyes shoot wide -- Lucilla bolts up -- Gracchus leans forward -- Proximo is stunned -- the crowd is mystified --",
        "Cassius": "... and the Emperor will have no more animal battles today --  Upset roars from some of the trainers.   Talk to the man in the imperial box. Who has the next slot...? (he checks the boards -- Lentulus, Gideon, Trebonius and Proximo --  -- Nice to have you back, you piratical bastard -- now listen, the Emperor wants the Carthage spectacle.  The four trainers explode in a flurry of resistance --   You give us the Carthage match or lose your spot on the rotation -- but don't worry -- gold is flowing from the Emperor's fingers.    And I want to see this famous Spaniard of yours -- his reputation soars from the provinces.  The people are eager for him --   You will and the price will be 90,000 sesterces each --  -- which you all know is exorbitant  Give me your best, brothers.  They die before Caesar.  He strides back to the arena.  The touts instantly begin making new marks on the boards to represent the mysterious \"Carthage Spectacle\" as some of the trainers hurry out.  Proximo walks with Trainer #4:   This day we reach back to hallowed antiquity to bring you... THE FALL  But on that illustrious day the Gods sent against them Rome's greatest warriors...!  The very life-image of nobility and glorious valor... who would on this day, and on these same arid Numidian deserts, decide THE FATE OF THE EMPIRE... Your Emperor is pleased to give you... THE  ... in his majestic charity the Emperor has deigned to this day favor the people of Rome with an historical final match.  Returning to the Colosseum today... after five years in retirement... Caesar is pleased to bring you... THE ONLY   And from the rocky promontories and martial bloodlines of Spain... representing the training lyceum of Proximo Antoninus... I give you...",
        "Juba": "Yes.  Juba spits what he has been chewing into his hands and moves to Maximus.   For your wound...  Maximus stares at him.    For your wound.  Maximus looks down -- the bloody wound at his side.  Juba carefully places his poultice over the wound -- Maximus hisses in pain -- Juba massages the poultice into the wound gently as:   If you die in the wagons they feed you to the lions... The lions are worth more than we are.  I think we are worth more than the zebras though.  So they don't feed us to them.  Maximus stares at him.  Juba looks down at him with the barest hint of a smile.   I'm not sure about the giraffe.   Have you killed a man before?  Maximus does not respond.   You should eat.  You'll need your strength tomorrow.  Maximus does not respond.   I've never killed a man.  But I think you have.  Maximus does not respond.   I almost killed once.  The Romans destroyed my village.  I was with a hunting party and when we returned... I would have killed every Roman in the world.  A long beat.   If you don't eat you will die.  Maximus does not respond.  A beat.   In the village I come from there was a man once.  He went fishing one day and his boat was attacked by crocodiles.  One of them ate his leg.  He pulled himself to the shore and a lion attacked him.  It ate one of his arms.  He dragged himself through the desert on the way home and a scorpion stung his eye.  So he only had one eye.  When he reached the village I sat with him.  I said, \"You have lost a leg, an arm and one eye.  You must have a mighty will to live.\"  He said, \"No, Lord, it's just better than the alternative.\"  Maximus finally looks at him.   Life is a gift from our fathers to us.  Who are you to give it up for lack of lifting a spoon?  Maximus does not respond.    Are we going to fight each other?   Do you think it will be much different?  Here in Rome?   Are you scared for tomorrow?   Me too.  A beat.   I never though it would be so easy to kill.  A beat.   So you're finally home.   For all Romans... this is home.  A beat.    Among my people we honor the soil of our home.  Our ancestors are in that soil.  All their dreams live there. I will never see my home again.  The soil is dead and no one honors them, so the dreams die.  A beat.   How can I go back?  I am not what I was.  When a man kills for no reason, he has lost himself.  A long beat.  Juba leans his head back and quietly begins to sing.  A haunting lament in his native tongue.    I will fight with you.   Better to die for a friend than to die for gold.  The door swings open and they are surprised to see Proximo sweeping in with a cloaked woman.  The woman gives Proximo a bag of money.   And if we die that day -- we die free men worthy of our ancestors.   And impotent.  A beat.  Vibius thinks about it.   How did they know?    I'll stay here.  In case they follow.  Maximus stops as well.   Go!  Bring us the army!  Maximus nods.",
        "Hagen": "",
        "Falco": "Hail, Marcus Aurelius.   A war hero with a handsome face and a strong heart could go far.   Have you never considered Rome?   He's a damned provocateur.",
        "Cicero": "",
        "Lucilla": "He's been dying for ten years.   How do you know that?    Maybe he just misses us.   Peace, Commodus.  After two weeks on the road your incessant scheming is hurting my head.  A beat.   The first thing I shall do is have a hot bath.  The wagon rumbles to a halt.  Voices are heard outside.  Commodus leaps out...    Civilization at last.  Gods preserve us.   Father.   You're right.   I would have been what you taught me to be.  A beat.  They stare at each other.  He finally smiles.   He always favored you...  He turns.  Lucilla is waiting.  She glides to him.   Even over his son.   Maximus, stop...  Let me see your face.  He turns to her.   You've been crying.   What does my father intend?  He turns and walks.  She walks with him.   You're lying.  I could tell when you were lying even when we were children.  You hate it.   True.  But then you never had to. Maximus, stop...  ... Is it really so terrible seeing me again?   And you are hurt to see my father dying.  A beat.   He will announce Commodus' succession.  That's why he summoned us.  Will you serve my brother as you served his father?   Do you know I still remember you in my prayers...?  Oh yes, I pray... Ever since that day you saved me from drowning off Capri.  Do you remember?   Commodus was so angry that a mere peasant -- a Spaniard no less -- touched the royal person, do you remember his anger?   Mark this, Maximus:  that is the man who will be Emperor.  A beat.   There was a time when you didn't call me \"Highness.\"    Very different... I wonder if it was better?   Hail, Caesar.   Gentlemen, in the future do not concern my brother with these matters.  Come to me.  She sweeps out.  A beat.    Quiet, brother...  Unseen by him, she adds a little special powder to the drink from a vial secreted in her robe.   Leave the Senate to me.  Don't trouble yourself.   Shhh.  The tonic will help...  She takes a sip and then hands it to him.   Yes, just drink this down.  She sits on the edge of the bed.  He drinks as:   Our father lost his way.  His mistake was believing the old songs of the \"Republic.\"  We know better. So let the Senate talk.  They have no real power.    Still afraid of the dark, brother?   I'll stay with you until you are asleep.    Senators Gracchus and Gaius and Captain Marcellus are waiting.   He's asleep.  Be quick.   Good.   Can they be bought?   And they've started arresting scholars now.  Anyone who dares speak out -- even satirists and chroniclers.   The future.  The future pays for it...  A beat.  She looks at them.   He's started selling the grain reserves.   He's selling Rome's reserves of grain.  The people will be starving in two years.  I hope they are enjoying the spectacles because soon enough they will be dead because of them.   And who will tell them?!  You, Marcellus?  You, Senator Gaius? Will you make a speech on the Senate floor denouncing my brother?  And then see your family in the Colosseum?  What town-crier would dare?  A long beat.   He must die.  A beat as her words sink in.   No -- cut off the head and the snake cannot strike.   What about the army?   So we do nothing?!  A door opens, a voice...    It's all right, darling, you --  Lucius suddenly notices Senator Gracchus:   Lucius, you go in now, I'll be in shortly.   What are you going to do?  Gracchus goes to her, holds her.   I don't know.   Mmm.   What are you going to do?   Good.   When he defies my brother the Emperor, he defies me.  But you shouldn't send assassins.   The people embraced him today.  They will be expecting his next match... (she kneels next to him ... let him die in the arena like the slave he is.  Let the people see what comes of defying Caesar.  A beat as he looks at her.   Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.  Maximus backs up, fighting the urge to strangle her on the spot.  He finally bumps into a wall of the cell.   Maximus, listen to me --   I knew nothing of that.   I wept for them.   Do you know what it is to be the daughter of the Emperor?  I learned on the night my father had my husband killed.  I loved my husband very much.  Very... simply.  He was a man who believed in the Republic. He was a man who thought Marcus should be tending to Rome and not conquering the world.  One night my father had him strangled for conspiring with the Senate.  My father never spoke of it.  I never spoke of it.  That is what it is to be the daughter of Rome.  She finally looks up at Maximus.   My son will live.  He will survive this cursed bloodline.  Rome will die and the jackals will pick her clean -- but my son will survive. Empires come and go.  Cities crumble to dust.  Only family matters.  A beat.  Despite himself, Maximus is moved.   So is mine.  A beat.   So do I.  A beat.  Maximus is surprised at her direct answer.   My son will never be safe while he lives.  A beat.   The Senate is with us, and the City Guard.  We have growing power in the streets.  But we need a leader. Someone the people can --   No.  So that my son will be safe. So that we may leave this charnel house forever and never look back. Look into my eyes, Maximus, and believe what I say to you...  She rivets him intensely with her eyes.   By all the Gods, and in the name of my father who loved you, and in the name of the husband I loved... I swear to stand by your side in this now and always.  A beat.   Lucius Verus.  Like his father.   Commodus plans to kill you in your next match in the arena.  He's planning something.  I will pray for you.  As I have always done.  She then pulls something from her robes and sets it down, a little bundle wrapped in cloth.  She sweeps out.  The sound of the door being bolted shut on the other side.  Maximus stands for a moment and then goes to what she has left.  He opens the cloth.  Inside are his six \"ancestor\" figures.  He picks up one of the figures.  He looks at it deeply, gently feeling along the contours with a finger.   Lucius, run along now.  I need to talk to the General.  Lucius runs off to his Male ATTENDANT, who leads him away.  A long beat as Maximus and Lucilla look at each other.  Finally:   ... Maximus will summon his army from Ostia and he will strike from the inside as his army strikes from the outside.  But he insists that the Senate be present.   How many are with us?   I'll arrange it.   He has withdrawn.  He's not eating. He doesn't go out.  He won't even see me... I don't know what tempests rage within him but...   Yes.  A beat.   And they will march on Rome for you?   Captain Marcellus will take it.  And his City Guard will by with you when you get to Rome.  Is that enough to face the Praetorian Guard?    Lucilla is with her HANDMAIDEN.  They sit before a large mirror, the Handmaiden perfecting Lucilla's makeup for the day.  One of Commodus' Centurion Body Guards enters, bows.   Caesar...  He turns.  She stops.  He looks as if he has not slept for days.  If a word could now sum up his clouded face it is this:  tormented.  She goes to him, embraces him.  He holds her tightly.   Of course...  He moves away from her, slowly moving around the room.   Brother, do not be influenced by the mob.  They are a great, faceless beast --   They see themselves in him.  They throw in their own sad dreams alongside his.  They think he fights for them.   And what if he should win?  A beat.  Commodus continues to slowly move around the room.   Caesar, you let this unduly worry you.  At best he is a passing fancy -- he is a name, an image on a banner, ephemeral -- he will be forgotten as the next fancy appears --   Mercy.  He stops.  Looks at her.   He will not kill in the arena.  He is merciful.  As they all wish they were in their own hearts.  Something in her words has struck a chord in him.    Commodus sweeps in.  Thinks Lucilla is standing there. The woman turns, it is Lucilla's Handmaiden.   Don't even say it.  I know it's dangerous -- but I had to see you. Captain Marcellus has gone to the army with your message as you instructed.   He says the City Guard will be ready at the south road at noon.  They can only wait for an hour so --   Did I?  All right then.  So everything is prepared.  The Senate will be in attendance and you have your gladiators -- the usual cohort of Praetorians will be inside the arena --   Tell me honestly... please... do you think it will work?  A beat.   Do you think we'll all die?   Will you swear something to me?   Will you swear it on the memory of your son?  A long beat.   By all that you have ever loved... swear that if you survive you will take my son out of Rome.  Swear that you will go far away and never return.  He steps to her.   I will.  A long, difficult beat.  She fights back tears.   Had I not been the daughter of Rome...  He puts a gentle finger to her lips.    Lucilla enters, deep in thought, still drained from her meeting with Maximus.  She suddenly stops.  Frozen.  Commodus is sitting across the chamber, Lucius at his knee.  An open scroll on Commodus' lap.   Remember your mother.  She pulls the ceremonial dagger from his little uniform and pushes him to his attendant -- his attendant pulls him away as --  Lucilla spins to Commodus -- he grabs her into an embrace -- he turns the knife on her -- thrusting deeply as he kisses her --  A long kiss as he holds her tightly to him.  Then he gently sits her down on her throne.  Her eyes wide, dying.  One of Commodus' Body Guards grabs him:",
        "Maximus": "A people should know when they are conquered.  A beat.   At the first signal release the catapults.  We'll use the cavalry to cut off the retreat.   I hope not, because I'm going to be leading them.  A beat as he gazes down at the enemy.   Why don't they know they're already dead?    Hold steady... steady...  He can see the nightmare destruction of the encampment continuing -- fire pots and Scorpion bolts and flaming arrows -- panic in the German encampment.   Steady...  He sees the Germans begin fleeing across the plain.  He quickly raises his sword and whispers a prayer, then turns to his men:   Brothers -- I salute you!  For Rome!  He spurs his horse and races out of the trees to the plain...   Caesar.   I don't think there's anyone left to fight.   Should Caesar permit, I'll go home. I've been away too long.  I've forgotten my wife's face and I barely know my son.  Suddenly, a tethered GERMAN PRISONER they are passing calls out to them:    Come, Caesar...   For the glory of the empire, sire.   They honor you, Caesar.   Highness.  They walk, Maximus still supporting Marcus, as:    Caesar, you do the lady injustice.    If you'll excuse me, Highness.  He turns and stalks away.   What, Gallus, losing your other hand?   And the women of your village will crave your touch even more.   What's your name, son?   The name suits you.   You're dying because you love Rome, as I do.   Neither have I.  Rome for us lives here... (he touches his heart ... it's a thing inside us that came from our ancestors and that we give to our children.   Yes, it's a glorious place.    If you want to stay on, I support you.  So do the men.  I'll ask the Emperor to appoint you in my place.   I'll return after a season at home. Maybe two.   Should the Gods so bless me.  I would be thankful.  Commodus perambulates up to them.   Yes.    I'm going home.  Senators Gaius and Falco join them.   No.   I'm a soldier, not a politician.  Meanwhile, a dark eye is studying the men through a hidden slit in the tent wall.  The eye is particularly drawn to Maximus.   I can't do that.   My men have been fighting for five solid days.  They're too busy dying to go on dress parade.  A beat.  Commodus' eyes flash fire at this public rebuke. He very quickly gets control.    Caesar.  Marcus holds out a scroll.   I never acquired the art, sir.   Caesar, I am honored but --   Sire, you brought the light of the Gods to barbarian darkness.  You brought civilization and justice to the farthest --   Yes, Caesar.   You're not dying.   Caesar, you do me honor -- but your son has pride of place for succession.   I shall, Caesar.  A beat.   You have always been my father.  He goes.    That's not true.   I lost too many men.   I don't know.   I never acquired your comfort with it.   No.  I'm sorry.  I'm tired from the battle.   I will always serve the ideals of Rome.  A beat.   Yes.   Yes.   May I be permitted to go, Highness?  She smiles sadly.   And there was a time when you were just a little girl drowning in the sea.  All that was a different life.   It was more honest.  A moment between them.  We sense there is much to be said, much that could be said.  Finally:   I thank you for your prayers.  He goes.  She watches him walk away.    Maximus kneels before a small altar in his tent.  He faces six small figures that represent his dead ancestors.   Ancestors, true bloodline, I ask you for your guidance.  Bring me your solace and your wisdom.  Blessed Mother, come to me in my dreams with the Gods' desire for my future. Blessed Father, watch over my wife and my son with a ready sword.  Keep them safe until my return.  Whisper to them in their sleep that I live only to hold them again and all else is dust and air.  Ancestors, true bloodline, I honor you and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.  He looks at his \"ancestors\" for a moment and then blows out the candles around them.    Quintus is waking Maximus --   Quintus -- ?   What is it?  Is he ill?   How did he die?  Commodus does not respond.   How did he die?   How will the world speak your name now, old man?  Without a glance to Commodus, he stalks out.  A silent beat.  Then Commodus nods to Quintus.  Quintus goes.  Lucilla looks at Commodus for a long moment, her face an enigmatic tornado of complex emotions.  Then:    Maximus is kneeling before his ancestors, head down, his fists clenched, praying.  Quintus and four Praetorian ASSASSINS suddenly burst in -- the assassins move immediately to bind Maximus -- swords at his throat --   What -- ?!   Quintus --  Quintus goes to Maximus' armor, which hangs nearby, and slowly removes his seal of office.    Five horses are waiting.   Quintus, what -- ?    My family?!  A beat.   What about my family, Quintus?   Have you ever done this before?   Killed a man with a sword?   It can be very messy -- you could get blood all over your armor.  You don't want to hack me up now.  You want one clean stroke.   One good stroke -- you do know where, don't you?   If you miss the spot there'll be blood everywhere.  Quite a spray.   Here -- you don't want to hit the vein on the neck --  Maximus points his bound hands at a spot on the back of his neck.   Put the point of your sword here... you want one, good blow right at this spot --  Assassin #3 dutifully puts the point of his sword on the spot on Maximus' neck.  A grave mistake.  Maximus instantly grabs the blade of the sword with his hands and yanks it from Assassin #3 -- EXPLODING up -- his hands are bleeding but he tosses the sword into the air and catches it -- swings the sword with brutal efficiency -- decapitating both assassins --    Lucilla stands in Maximus' tent.  She looks around.  She gently touches his Lorica Segmentata.  Her fingertips move along the contours of his armor.  She tries to retain her neutral demeanor.  She notes his \"ancestors\" on the small alter.     Am I in Hades?    Maximus and Juba share a small, filthy cell.  The cell door faces the open compound.  Across the compound they can see the much more comfortable cells of the \"star\" gladiators such as Vibius.  They both sit on the floor, leaning against the wall. Juba is eating a bowl of food with a wooden spoon. Maximus' bowl and spoon are at his side, he has not touched them.   Gladiator.  A beat.   Nothing more.  A beat.  Proximo watches Maximus very closely for the following:    The Emperor -- will he be there?   Have you -- how does one meet the Emperor?   Yes.   He give it personally?   You knew Marcus?   No.   Bigger arena.  Same killing.  A beat.   No.  A beat.   This isn't my home.   Perhaps one day you'll return.  Juba looks at him.   Yes, but --   What -- ?  Trumpets begin sounding from the arena.      This isn't your battle.   I knew your brother would send assassins.  I didn't think he would send his best.   My family were crucified and burnt while they were still alive.    Don't lie to me.   Don't.  A long, tense moment.  She does not look at him.   My son was innocent.   I want your brother dead.   How do you plan it?   So the crown passes to your son.   What is your son's name?   I weep for him.  A long beat.  Maximus' cold eyes give away nothing.  Lucilla turns and starts to go.  She stops, not looking back.   What can you tell me?    The crowd cheers.  Maximus appears from his gate.  His fans have increased in number considerably.  They eagerly crane forward and celebrate him.  Meanwhile, Maximus looks at Tiger.  Only one man with a sword?  Maximus approaches, cautious but confident.  He stops a few feet from Tiger.  They lock eyes, salute each other and then turn to the Imperial Box, raising their swords.  The crowd waits eagerly for the immortal words...   We who are about to die salute you.  The crowd cheers and Maximus immediately turns and starts slashing -- Tiger easily blocks and strikes back --  The sword play is very fast -- they block and parry and hack like lightning -- constantly attacking -- they are perfectly matched --  As he fights Maximus becomes aware of a strange sound over the roar of the crowd -- a low rumbling -- then he feels something -- a vibration in the ground --  Suddenly traps doors swing open and four enormous platforms rise into view.  On each platform is a snarling Bengal tiger restrained by a chain.  Tiger's teams of \"cornermen\" hold the chains through a pulley system.  The cornermen are safely inside cages.  The platforms stop at ground level.  The four ferocious tigers now mark the four corners of the battleground.  Tiger takes advantage of Maximus' momentary confusion and assaults brutally -- forcing him back toward one of the tigers -- the tiger claws for Maximus -- Maximus just evades it claws -- rolls for a new position -- another tiger snaps at him --  Tiger attacks -- Maximus is on the defensive -- fighting off Tiger and evading the four snarling beasts --  And then all four tigers are suddenly closer.  The teams of cornermen are letting the chains play out, bit by bit, gradually reducing the size of the battle ground.  The crowd roars.  But the fight is hardly fair.  Whenever Tiger is near one of the tigers the cornermen pull back the tiger slightly -- when Maximus is near a tiger they let it out a bit.  Maximus and Tiger fight -- swirling action -- finally, Maximus has the edge -- he circles so that the sun stabs into Tiger's eyes -- then Maximus lunges forward under Tiger's swinging sword and SLAMS into him -- they fall -- a tiger swats at Maximus' face -- he jerks his head back -- he shoots out a leg and kicks Tiger's sword toward one of the tigers -- it is out of reach -- Maximus leaps up and stands over the winded Tiger, sword to his throat.  Tiger is gasping for breath, crushed.  Then one of Tiger's corners suddenly cheats -- they completely release a tiger -- it leaps for Maximus --  Maximus barely has time to turn -- the tiger crashes into him -- its claws slashing into his back, cutting through his leather armor -- Maximus shoves an armored forearm into the tiger's jaws and stabs with his sword --  Tiger takes this chance to pull himself up -- one of his corners throws him another sword -- the crowd boos --  Maximus wrestles with the tiger -- spinning it around with superhuman effort so it is always between himself and Tiger -- so that Tiger can't get at him --  Maximus finally kills the tiger and leaps for Tiger -- he quickly disarms him and tosses him to the ground --  Maximus stands over him -- ready to administer the coup de grace.  All eyes turn to the Emperor.  Commodus slowly stands and steps to the edge of the Imperial Box.  He raises his arm and gives the fatal thumbs down.  Maximus looks up at him.  And then defiantly tosses the sword to the ground, refusing to kill Tiger.  Commodus is stunned.  The crowd gasps -- a collective intake of breath -- and then an enormous roar building.  It cascades around the Colosseum.  It is a roaring celebration of the unexpected act of mercy.  And the delicious act of defiance of the Emperor.  Commodus slowly sits.  Maximus walks across the arena -- the people stand and cheer for him.  Cries of \"Maximus the Merciful\" can be heard.  It is the birth of a hero.   I was a General.   It doesn't take courage to kill.   I'm sorry.   I had a father.  He wasn't really my father but I cared for him very much.   Where is my army?  A drum beat is heard.  It increases throughout the following scenes, building momentum like a Roman gallery accelerating to ramming speed.  The conspiracy scenes are enclosed in a montage of scenes in and around the arena showing Maximus' growing popularity with the People of Rome...   I will not kill another warrior. There is no honor to it.  Maximus goes.  Vibius thinks about it, listening to the adulation of the crowd.  The drums continue...   Tell him we will enter Rome on the first day of Commodus' festival.   Yes.  But this letter must go to the lieutenant named Titus, no one else.    The Felix Regiment will never be defeated.  A beat.   I want Commodus dead.   Because one night an old man whispered to me about a dream.  I will die for that dream.  A long beat.   He did.   As will I, Commodus.  As will I.  Commodus unwraps the cloth bundle.  Inside is a small wooden sword.  He holds it up so the crowd can see.  A collective gasp.  The wooden sword, prized by all gladiators above all else.  Freedom.   I only have ancestors because of you, brother.  You killed everything that ever lived alongside me.  A beat.   This is the new home you cursed me to.  And I am safer here from your treachery than I could ever be outside.   Why don't you ask your father that?  Commodus visibly flinches at that, but still holds the wooden sword out.  The crowd is breathless.   I have more power as a slave in the arena than I could ever have as a free man.  As the Colosseum goes, the people go.  As the people go, the Empire goes.   No, Caesar... I will show you.  With that, Maximus does the unimaginable.  He simply turns his back on the Emperor and walks away.  And the crowd goes mad.  They cheer the defiant gladiator, their champion.  And, equally, they deride the Emperor.  They mock him by holding out food and trash like Commodus is holding out the wooden sword.  They laugh and jeer.  Commodus glances around at his children, lost.  Then he turns to the Imperial Box.  He sees Lucilla slipping out the back of the box.  He watches her go.  And the crowd continues to jeer.   The Felix Regiment will come from here.  We'll face the body of the Praetorians outside -- here.  Once inside, my archers will take up position to counter opposition inside the Colosseum.  I'll enter and join you -- we'll attack here --  Maximus draws a line to the Imperial Box.   -- a covert assault from within.   Probably.  A beat.   But if we aren't... think of the glory.  Do you remember glory, Gladiator?   Then be worthy of him.  The old Titan who would rather die bravely in a just battle than slink off to grow old and fat.   Was it Centurion...?  General...?   A soldier knows a soldier.  A beat.   No --   You said something to me once.  You said in this life, we all die.  All we can choose is how we die.  And how we are remembered.  Do you recall those words?   Then be remembered proudly.  This is your time, Proximo.  Stand at my side and be what you were.  What you truly are.  One last time.  A beat.  Proximo suddenly begins to weep rather histrionically -- Maximus is a bit taken aback -- Proximo dramatically flicks tears from his eyes -- and then can't keep the show up -- he bursts into laughter.  Maximus stares at him.   You pox-ridden bastard -- !    A quarter?!   You know, if you were half so awful as you pretend, you'd be a terrifying man.  Maximus shakes his head, smiling, and goes.  Proximo sits for a moment.  Then he rises and goes to a heavy chest.  He looks at the chest for a moment and then opens it.  Inside is his old Lorica Segmentata.  He gazes at his armor, considering what he once was.  And what he now is.   Lucilla --   Good.   You've told me this already.   Lucilla... why are you here?  A pause.   No.   Yes.  She leans against a wall.  A pause.   Yes.   Yes.    I will.  A beat.   And if I should not survive... swear to me that you will honor my family in your prayers always.   Shhh... my heart breaks enough.  He holds her closely, tenderly.   But --   We were betrayed.   You're not coming?   Old friend...   Where is he?  Just then Quintus emerges from the largest tent.  He stares at Maximus, unbelieving.  A long beat as they look at each other.  Quintus knows his destiny.  With quiet dignity he begins whispering a prayer.  Maximus moves to him, embracing him:   I forgive you.  He stabs Quintus with a dagger as he embraces him. Quintus falls.  A beat.  Titus goes to the dead Quintus and pulls the seal of office from his uniform.  He hands it to Maximus.  An enormous roar of celebration from the Felix Regiment.   Throw down your weapons or we will kill you.  A beat.  The Praetorian Officer glances at the formidable force against him.  He drops his sword.  His men follow suit.     Captain?  Proximo takes the sword.   (re: Commodus and the others Where are they going?!   For my wife!  Maximus strike hard -- Commodus barely blocks the blow --   For my son!  He strikes harder -- Commodus is losing --   For my father!  He strikes with everything he's got -- slashing Commodus -- Commodus sails back -- his sword falling --  Maximus stands over him.  Glaring.  Commodus is panting, defeated, glaring up at him.  A beat.   We who are about to die salute you.  Maximus raises his sword high -- Commodus raises an arm -- Maximus SMASHES the sword down -- and Commodus is dead.  A moment as Maximus stands over Commodus.  Then he looks at the series of counterweight ropes around the elevator platform.  He slices through one of the ropes and the platform begins to rise...   Rome... you are better than this. Look inside yourselves.  I challenge you to find your true voice.  Help the Senate speak for you.  Make them your champion... And dare to think what could be.  A beat.   I give you back the dream.  With that he slowly turns and walks down the steps to the arena sand.  The crowd is absolutely silent.  He goes to Titus:   When everything has calmed down, lead an orderly withdrawal.  Take them home.  Titus salutes.  Maximus return the salute and then leaps onto his horse. As he canters toward the exit he turns for one final look at Lucilla.  He sees that Lucius is now at the foot of the stairs, on the arena sand, gazing at him.  Maximus stops his horse.  He canters back to Lucius.  The boy looks up at him.  A moment between them.  Lucius thrusts up his hand.  Maximus grabs his hand and swings him onto the horse behind him.  A look to Juba.  Juba bows his head with respect. Farewell.  Maximus spins the horse around and begins cantering out of the Colosseum.  Juba disappears into the crowd.  Maximus and Lucius canter across the arena and through the huge doors...   It doesn't look it now... but soon we'll have it growing again... Next year there will be vines, and then there will be grapes... It will be alive.  We leave them, dreaming of the future.",

    "description": "Maximus is a powerful Roman general, loved by the people and the aging Emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Before his death, the Emperor chooses Maximus to be his heir over his own son, Commodus, and a power struggle leaves Maximus and his family condemned to death. The powerful general is unable to save his family, and his loss of will allows him to get captured and put into the Gladiator games until he dies. The only desire that fuels him now is the chance to rise to the top so that he will be able to look into the eyes of the man who will feel his revenge.—Chris \"Morphy\" Terry",
