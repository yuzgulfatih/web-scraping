Your left rear parking light is not illuminated.  I'm gonna give you a provisional citation. Get this repaired in the next 48 hours and you'll have no problem.    Have an enjoyable Holiday.  Is there a Ray Eddy here?  Can I speak to you outside for a minute.  It's not about that. I just have a few questions.  This is about the woman who was with you.  How long have you known her?  She's a smuggler.  Yes.  Yes, well, there is that element on the Reservation I'm sure you know.  How did you happen to meet her?  I just thought you should be aware of that. She's known to have smuggled illegal immigrants into the country.  If I were you I'd find a new baby sitter. You don't want her around young kids.  Well, you have an enjoyable Holiday.     As long as they're not on a watch list. Four months.  I don't think you have much to worry about judging from the look of them, probably brought here to work in the sex trade.  Not necessarily. They can apply for asylum.  Is there somebody I can call for you? To take care of your children.  A relative.",

Call me when you have the balloon payment.             ...what I think you'll find with the Commodore -- and you'll be the judge -- is that the vinyl wall covering is perfect for small children. There is never a need to repaint or even touch up-    What do you want?  Is this all of it?  I told you all or nothing.  Can't argue with that. You'll have to sign something, though.",
        "Bernie": "Lila. Get up. I got a job for you!  Lila! Get up.  They got two people out sick today, so if you get down there you got the job.  Get dressed, I got coffee. Let's go!  Get in, I'll tell you on the way.     Rita said you quit.  That's not what she said.  Then get some glasses.  Gimme a break.  The Tribal Council needs someone to answer phones.  Why not? You can answer a phone, can't you?    From who?  What do you need a car for?  You'll live. And you know what I'm talking about.  We got our own court system.  If we did, we'd have to arrest half the people on the Rez.  You can't start throwin' Mohawks off the Rez, Rosalie. There's only, what, six thousand of us as it is.  But she has a Mohawk son.  Jake was a big boy. He knew what he was doin'  We've had smuggling on the Rez since Al Capone.  Hi, Lila.  You're in a lot of trouble.  The council voted to expel you.  For five years. You can appeal, but you'll never be able to change Rosalie's mind.  They'll make your life miserable if you try to stay.  Believe me, it could get even worse.  If she leaves, they'll turn you in Lila. The troopers want somebody.  The Chiefs want her out, so there's nothing standing between her and the troopers.  If you leave she won't see her son again.  Lila, you're giving up on him and he's only one year old.  Jake wouldn't agree with that.  He wanted to keep you and little Jake safe.  Sure.  She's gonna kill me for taking this out of her car.",

Did you tell him you had it?  Jesus Christ! The glove compartment!? That's the stupidest place you could have put it.  Did he leave anything?  What are you gonna do?  You could look for him?  We should look for him.  The Rez,  So let's go, let's find him before he blows it all.  What do you mean?  But he'll lose it all.  He stole our money. Call the Troopers.  So you're just gonna sit there?  Another Christmas in the tin crapper.    I can get a job you know.  They won't ask any questions.  Come on, you don't think we can live on what you make at All for a Dollar do you?  I bet I could make more than you do.  Aren't we even gonna look for him?  That's it?  Aren't you even gonna look for him?  I can't believe you're not even gonna look for him.  The reservation.    If I get it working I can sell it.  Rentaworld called. They're coming to get the TV if you don't pay by four tomorrow.  Did you find him?  Where was the car?  I bet he went to Atlantic City.  Yeah, but you could figure it out. Just find out what buses came through last-  What happened to your face?  What, did you get in a fight with somebody?  You got in a fight, for real?  No way. I say we go back there and kick some Mohawk ass.  Where's your car?  You left it on the rez? That's so stupid.  I still say we go back there and kick some Mohawk ass.  That would be kinda miraculous since there's no food in the house.  Popcorn and Tang.  I'm not eatin' that again for dinner.  What about Rentacenter?  They said they're coming to get the furniture if they don't get a payment by 4 o'clock.  Look I don't see why you won't just let me get a job with Mitch.  He's got like this whole business he runs.  No, it's computers. He works on computers.  That's so stupid. We're gonna lose the TV while I'm sitting in some Christmas assembly when I could be-    -Hello  Is this Mrs. Irene ThreeRivers? -Mrs. Bonaparte, I have good news.  -I'm the business manager of Mr. E.F. ThreeRivers and I have been authorized to inform you that you have inherited money. -Are you still there? -Wait, I don't WANT any money, I want to GIVE you money. -That's right. You have inherited money from his computer fortune. -He was the second richest man next to Bill Gates. -He left you Twenty-six thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars.  My mom told me to give you her credit card number.  Well, my Mom might be late.  Where'd you get that?  No way.  It's been like two years.      That's what he wants.  For Christmas.    Air-Stunt-Challenge-Set.  What?  Yeah, \"just in case.\"  Is that why you bought Calgon Bath Stuff?   Yeah, right.   Be afraid. Be very afraid. What about Dad?   What are you gonna do?   No, but maybe he would call if you weren't so bitter.   That's what I mean. You're always on him. \"Where's your paycheck, do you need a meeting, give me your receipts.\"   You're still bitter.   Where are you going?   What about Santa Claus?    -Hi Mitch. It's T.J. No, T.J. from school. Yeah, man. Right. Uh, I was wondering if you still needed those numbers we were talking about `cause I got one. -How much? -Cool, but the thing is I don't really have any wheels at the moment. -On Moira road off 37. -Yeah, but there's one more thing...(he whispers into the phone inaudibly)...no the air stunt challenge set. -Yeah, exactly. Yeah, man. Thanks a lot. Bye.    Yeah, that's pretty cool. But it's gonna hurt when you sit down.  Now unwrap yourself, it's dinner time.  Close enough.  Hot Wheels.  I called a friend.  No, its not.  It's not like you were gonna get it.  Oh, yeah. I forgot.  Popcorn.  Sorry.  Shh.  What did he want? Did something happen to Dad?  Then what did he want?  The pipes froze so I fixed `um.  Yeah.  It's just a tin crapper.  So, we're gettin' a new one, right?  It's not yours, he gave it to me.  No!  Are you gonna shoot me now, too?  Maybe he didn't like gettin' shot in his own house. Maybe that's why he left.  Some accident you shot him in the foot.    So, he'd done it before.  You can't have it. It's mine.  Yeah, awesome dad. Robs us and takes off a week before Christmas.  Hello. Hi, Mom.  -Mom are you there? What's wrong? -What kinda trouble? -What did you do? -A smuggler!? Holy shit! -Are you in jail? -But are you're going to jail!?  -Yeah, okay. What does that mean? But why? I can take care of him, I do it all the time. But I don't see why we need-?  -Who?  A baby? No way. -Yeah I know where the stuff is. It's in the shed, but that's so stupid!.    -Okay. Bye.",

        "Ricky": "Is it here?  Is it here yet? `Cause I'm ready.  Wait, where are they going?  But why are they leaving?  That's our house!  Where's daddy?  Where did he go?  When is daddy coming home?  Mommy, I was thinking. What's gonna happen to the tin crapper when we get our new house?  Then what?  Then what?  And you can buy me some?  Yes!  Mommy!       Daddy is gettin' me that for Christmas.  He's bringing the new house.  Hey T.J., watch this!  Daddy?  Why is the police man here?  Can I have more corn?",
        "Lila": "Huh?  That? I found it.  The keys were in it.                           This camper belongs to my brother in law. He won't like this.  I thought it was abandoned, the guy driving it got on a bus.  New York or Buffalo, I'm not sure.    He'll pay more than it's worth.  Maybe two thousand.  He's always looking for cars with button- release trunks.  He don't need papers or anything.  All I know is he pays good for a car like this.  Through the woods. Not far.  He'll give me something for finding it.  Yeah.  Turn up there.  Where that stump is.  There's a path.  It's not far.  Not too fast. There's ruts.  Don't worry they already put out the Christmas trees. There's no black ice.  No, it's Mohawk land. The Rez is on both sides of the river.  There's no border.  Don't worry, it'll hold a Plymouth. I've seen semis cross it.  The only other way is the Cornwall bridge and they won't let you take that. (points at the gun).  They plow it and everything.  Not too fast, there are ruts.  You gotta pick up some speed to get up the bank.  It's just on the other side of those trees.  Honk the horn.  Just keep your mouth shut.  Just keep it shut. Okay?  Hi, Jimmy.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I know. Sorry.  Count it.  Just count it.  How much is there?    Just back up.  I'll give you half. Now let's go.  Let's go!  There's no border here. This is free trade between nations.    Why'd your husband leave you?  Maybe he wanted a younger women.  That's what usually happens.  I never have to worry about that. My husband is dead. Went down in the river on a run. They never found him. Probably tangled in river weeds.  You better slow down there are ruts out here. You could get stuck in one.  Keep going.  They won't stop you. You're white.  Pull around back then wait for him to come to the window.  Roll down your window.  Count it.  Let's go.  Turn down there.  Stop here.  Now open the door.  Open the door.  Now get out.  Get out.    Good. How's business?  How much for that one?  What?! I've been saving up.  Does Bernie Littlewolf run your whole life?  I gotta walk down 37 with the semis kickin' up snow and mud in my hair just to get to the work.  I don't like Chevettes.  I'll give you a thousand for the Malibu.  That thing has been sittin' here for six months.  He doesn't have to know.             I'll give you the money if you give me the car.  The money's gone.  It's gonna cost me to get that hole fixed. I froze last night.  It's not a crime.  I don't usually work with whites.  How many bedrooms?  How old?  I got a boy. Almost one.  He lives with my mother-in-law. (after a moment) She stole him from me.  Yeah. Right out of the hospital.  Tribal police don't get involved in stuff like that.  Thanks.  Don't worry about it.  Okay.  We gotta pick them up.  Not far.  An old casino through the woods. They used to have gambling there in the bootlegger days.  Keep that thing down.  Roll down the window and see what he wants.  Just roll it down.  Count it.  Open it.  To get away from the snakeheads.  The snakeheads pay to get them here and then they gotta work off what they owe .  Forty, fifty thousand. Depends where they're coming from.  Sometimes they gotta work for years to pay it off.  They always stink.  Yeah, but they can't stop you unless you give them a reason.  Once.  They gave me the choice of paying a fine or spending three months in jail.  I paid the fine. I made the money back in two nights of smuggling. But back then it was cigarettes and everybody did it. Some of the troopers were into it, too.  Yeah. But when they lowered the tax on cigarettes in Canada most people got out of it and the rest switched over to Chinese.  Count it.  Well, be sure it's right. I don't wanna get stiffed.  I got bad eyes.  What about mine?          Huh?       Where is it?  She fired me.  Well, she should have. I can't see to count the money. I told you that. I come up short half the time.  They make me carsick.  So where are we going?  No way!  Not there! Not with them.  I bought it.  Some white lady.  What?  To get to work. So I don't have to walk in the breakdown lane. Last week I almost got hit by the plow.  It doesn't have a trunk.  All right, all right! I'll go.  I think it's a \"T.\".  I told Bernie I couldn't see.  Nevermind. I'll go.  We gotta get extra fluid.  What for?  Mohawks don't celebrate Christmas.  Those are Christians. The converted.  From the Longhouse ways.  They're \"Pakis.\"  They're from Pakistan.  I don't know. What difference does it make?  If we wait much longer we won't be able to get back across the river.  Do you want the money or not?  They don't understand you.  If we keeps snowing like this we won't be able to get across the river.  We don't have time.  Is that a two or a five?  You gotta stop so I can fill up the wiper fluid.  It's a hundred feet deep out here if we get on black ice  What are you doing?  We gotta go back.  I can't believe you left it out there.  We gotta go back.  Look, there. Tracks.  Up there.  Slow down, I don't want to run over it. Stop. I think it was here.  It's dead.  It's dead.  Why?  I don't want to touch it.  I don't think it matters.  But it's too late.  Calm down.  Calm down. Just pull over.  He's got no reason to stop us, unless you give him one, so keep your mouth shut.  He won't, just remember you're white.    That's it?  It's moving.  Hello little baby.  He was dead.  He was dead.  That was the Great Spirit, not me.       Yeah.     Bernie!  I quit smuggling.  I got glasses and now I can see up close.  I don't want it.  I got enough.  How many bedrooms?  Wall to wall carpet?  Blow the horn.  You got a run for us, Jimmy?  How far?  A few times. Have you?  Up there. That's it.  Bruno.  No, Jimmy called-  We need to get paid, first.  You only got six hundred here.  It's six hundred apiece.  It's twelve hundred.    Let's go.    You're gonna get us all killed.  You should'a just taken the money from me?  We gotta get outta here, first.  It's all there.  Slow down a little. We gotta keep it under the speed limit.  We gotta get off this road.  Slow down!  We gotta get off this road!  Just up at the tree line.  They can't arrest us but if they catch us they'll take the money.  That ice is black out here.  I don't know.  We gotta crawl out the window.  Hi Bernie.  Expel me?  They can't do that.  They've already done that.  Let her go.    He might be better off.  It was all for a new crib. I wanted the baby to have a pretty new crib, not some handmedown. And he wouldn't let me go alone.  I was too fat to get behind the steering wheel.  Okay.    I need his coat.  Where's his coat?  Say goodbye to your Dudah.",
        "Ray": "Just give him toast.  Listening for the trucks.  Yeah.  I don't know how he found it, T.J.  I locked it in my glove compartment.  Yeah, I see that now, but the trucks were coming before the bank opened.  Duh? No, I guess he just sniffed it out.  He hasn't bought a scratch card in almost thirty two months. I thought it would be okay!  Nothing.  He could be anywhere.  Where?  With more than four thousand dollars, he's probably in Atlantic City by now.  I can't.  I just can't do it anymore.  T.J., we can't make him stop.  It's not stealing if you take it from your family. Anyway, he made some of it, too.  I'm sorry.          Hey, little sleepy head.  Wait a sec-        We're all ready for ya'.  We have it, it's just that they called Troy from Titus last night. That's where Troy works. The ski place? And anyway-  It was some emergency with the lifts. So he took off without thinking with the money. Completely forgot you were coming. So as soon as he gets back-  As soon as he can get here, I'll just run it down to you.  Look, Mr. Versales, I have a good job at ALL FOR A DOLLAR. They're probably gonna make me a manager after Christmas so I can handle the payments if you just leave the house-  I'll call you...  Listen to me. We'll get them back.  Ricky, I'll get them back. I promise, honey.  We're gonna get it back.    You're 15, T.J.  You're finishing school.  You're going to school.     He'll be back.  No! I'm going to work and you're going to school.  The only thing that changed is that your dad started gambling again. Everything else is the same.  He had to take a business trip.  And miss a day of work? No. Not again. We just have to live our lives. Now go get your backpack.  Go on!  I don't know, Ricky.  Where? Where do I look?  I told you, he could be in Atlantic City by now.  You're going to school.  Wait, wait.  Here. Lunch money.    I need to come on full-time.  What is that?  When I started you said it would be six months before I could come on full-time. And that was two years ago.  Well, I mean, you know, I do show up. Pat's late everyday. She's late now. She's always late.  See ya' tomorrow.  Just three...uh, no...two seventy one, two, three, four.    Did you see a Blue Acclaim come in here last night?  No, that's okay.  Thank you. Oh God, thank you, thank you thank you...  You son of a bitch!  I just need to look inside.  I don't want to play, I just need to look around for a second.  I'll stand right here at the door. I won't even go inside. I just need to see if my husband's in there.  He's gambling away the money for our house.  Long brown hair. Tall. Skinny. Ponytail.  Can I just look?  Hey!  That's my car.    You stole it.  So you just took it...?  We'll just see what the troopers say about that.      If you're in there you better come out.    I'm not kidding, honey, come on out.  This is New York State so quit the bullshit and give me my damn keys!    Did you see where the bus was headed?    I'm not leaving this here.  It's not for sale.  Why's that?  Does he use them to rob banks or something?  Where does he live?  What's in it for you?  If you try anything, I'm not afraid to use this.  Where?    I'm not crossing that!  That's Canada.  What about the border patrol?  I'm still not crossing that.    What's going on here?  Twelve hundred.  Wait, who the fuck are they?  I'm not moving until those people get out of my trunk.  I'm not taking them over the border. That's a crime.  This isn't a nation.  Fuck you.  What if the troopers stop us.  Twelve hundred.  You can't have my car.  You can't have my car.  No!           I told you not to use that thing when I'm not here.  I don't care. Don't use that thing when I'm not here!  No.  At the bus stop on the Rez.  You don't know that.  And then what? Chase him across the country. Miss work. No.  Nothin'.  It was no big deal.  Some Indian chick tried to steal your Dad's car.  It doesn't matter.  I'll get it tomorrow.  I didn't have a tow rope.  Forget it T.J. Did you and Ricky eat?  There's food.        They're gonna melt it down and make little toys out if it.  They'll send them back here so I can sell them at All for a Dollar.  That's right.     We just have to make it to my paycheck on Friday.  What about them?  You told me that already.  Here, lunch money.    He sells pot to kids?  You're fifteen, it's not gonna happen so forget it.  Your job is looking after your brother. Who's gonna take care of him?      I want my part.  I want my part.  No way.  Then I wanna get some more of those Chinese.  I just need enough for the balloon payment on my doublewide then I'm out of this. I'm no criminal.  You people can call it what you want to. I just want my double.  Suit yourself.  Three. I got kids.  Five and Fifteen.  Stole him?  Stole him?  What's going on?    Where's that?  What the hell is he doing?  What the hell is going on here?  Twelve hundred.  Why would they want to run?  What's that?  How much does it cost?  To get here?    God those are ripe.     Are they always there?  Have you ever gotten caught?  What happened?  What did you do?  Smuggling?  Right, I know.  Then why don't you count it?  You're welcome.  We're even now.                   It's okay. I got it right here. (she waves a wad of fifties and twenties). Two fifty five, right?    Wanna to go to the Price Chopper?    Is that so hard to believe?  Exactly, and that's why he gave me a bonus.  Do you wanna go to the Price Chopper or not?        What?  What is it, again?  -Hot Wheels Tech Trax, what?  I got something even better than that.  The double wide. But don't mention it to Ricky, just in case.  This time is for real.  Yes it is. We're getting a tub, T.J. It's gonna happen.   If you keep that attitude I'll never let you use it.   What about him?   Why, did he call broke yet?   Oh, here we go again with Saint Dad.   He's an addict, T.J.   You gotta help Ricky get the tree up tomorrow after school okay?   Christmas shopping.         Hi, it's me. leave a message, and maybe I'll call ya back.      Hi, it's me. I can't take the call right now, but if it's you, Troy, please at least tell me you are alive, because the boys are worried about you.  That's $87.50.  Sorry. Didn't go through.      I gotta get back before KMART closes.  I got nothing for under the tree.  Don't you people even take Christmas Eve off?  You could fool me the way they were all lined up at All for a Dollar today.  From what?  That's awful not to have Santa Claus-- for the kids, I mean.       Wait. They're not Chinese.  What does that mean?  Well where's that?  A big difference.  Look, I'm not driving just anybody across the border.  I wanna know what's in the bag.  What's in there?  Well, if they want to come over here so bad, they ought'a take the time to learn English.  Just hold on a second.  I'll take that. What are you doing?! Just count the money and let's go.  I just hope these aren't the ones that blow up themselves and everybody with them.    Shit!  I'm not stoppin'.  Nuclear power, poison gas,...you can't tell what they might have in there. I'm not gonna be responsible for that.  -Hi, I'm gonna be a little late. -I have to work. Is Ricky asleep? -Put him on. -Ricky listen to me, he's not coming until you go to sleep.  -No. Not yet. He's still flyin' over Canada okay? He's not even done with Canada yet, so he's not coming until you get to sleep. Now put your brother on. -I'll be home in a little while, okay? -No, I haven't got it,yet. What's it called again? -Hot Wheels Tech Trax Air Stunt whatever, right, right, I'll get it if I can! -I can't promise T.J. -There are more important things to get for Christmas this year. Be home in a little while. Okay, bye.       It was too heavy. We had to unload it.  What's the matter with her!?  What is she saying!?  It didn't feel like there was anything in that bag.  I can't believe they put their baby in a duffle bag.  If you'd let me search it I would never have taken it-  I know! I know that.                    (faintly heard though the  Come on!  Tap the bottom of his feet.  That's what they did to get Ricky breathing when he was born.  Well, I can't hold it and drive.  At least put him next to your body. That will warm him up.  Just do it! We can't give it back to her cold.      Shit!  Oh shit. What do I do?  What if he saw us go by before. To Bob's.  What if he searches the car. What do we say about-    Did I do something?  Okay.  Oh, I didn't know.  Thanks.  She looks after my kids when I have to work late.  Yeah, you, too.  Just a blown out tail light.  Yeah.      We gotta take it in.  What is it?  What? Are you sure?  He was just cold.  We found him.    He was just cold.  Okay, whatever, you brought him back to life.  All I know is Kmart is closed and I got nothing for under the tree.  What?  Look, I don't have time for that. I can't get deep about every little thing. I just have to keep on going. I only need one more run to have enough for my double.  Here.  Merry Christmas or whatever.         What's that?  Where'd you get it?  Mitch? Is that the friend you called? It's probably stolen, you know.  Well, I don't want you hanging around him. That kid is bad news.  Look , Mister, I got more important things to worry about than toys. I'm trying to get our doublewide.  Hey, you can lose the attitude. Anyway, Kmart was closed by the time I got off work.  What's that smell?  I told you to be careful with the microwave, didn't I?       Yes.  I haven't gotten the light fixed-  Sure.      Yes.  Not too long. She looks after my kids.  Really?  Wow. That's a shock.  Yeah, I've heard about it but I didn't know she was involved.  Uh, I think there was a sign for a baby sitter at the Wolf Mart. That's where I get my gas.  Oh my God.  Absolutely.  Thanks. You, too.     T.J. could you come out here for a minute.  No.  Did you have a fire last night?  You fixed um?  Did you happen to use the blow torch?  Look at this. We can't live here anymore!  No, it was our house.  Jesus, you could have killed yourself and your brother.  Put it down.  Put it down.  Put that thing down!  That was an accident.  He spent the food money on scratch cards,  Gimme that thing.  T.J. come on now.  He was clean for 23 months.    I know.  That's okay. I still wanna buy a ticket.  I got money.  I just want to buy some scratch cards.    He didn't mean to, but the pipes froze and he got that damn torch out -- which I told him not to do touch when I wasn't there -- and he tried to thaw them out-  There's a hole in my bedroom floor. We gotta move.  I just need one more run to get the double.  Look you can have the Acclaim. Okay?  What is it then?!  Are you still mad about that baby? `Cause it wasn't all my fault, ya' know. I mean who puts their kid in a duffle bag?  You're gonna need a lot of money to take care of a one year old baby.  Yeah, but you gotta get him first.  I'll help you. You can even borrow my gun.  You should see the inside.  Three. And it's got a jacuzzi tub in the master bathroom.  Oh yeah. But the best thing is the insulation. The pipes can never freeze.  I'll be back.  I wanna schedule a delivery.  It's three thousand but I want it delivered tomorrow.  Take it as a deposit. All you have to do is show up. If I don't have the rest you keep it.  Have you ever been there?  No, Troy didn't like to travel. He liked to work in his shed, mostly.  Can't miss that.  Okay. We'll take them.  Just open the trunk.  Turn around!  I want the rest.    No. But thanks.  Put it there.  He shot me.    Just COUNT IT and make sure it's all there!  Is it there?  Good.  I can't.  How much farther to the reservation?  What the hell? We're on the reservation.  Shit!  Will it hold us?  I gotta go.  No. You stay here.  I thought this was all legal on the reservation.    But, she's a Mohawk.  Listen, my kids got no one but me.  At least you got family to take care of him, ya' know?  It's just a few months, right?  I got baby stuff in the shed.  Get a good used single wide with insulation. Insulation is the key thing. Versailles will give you a hard time, but that will leave enough for you and the boys to live on for a couple of months. Ricky's allergic to penicillin. And you can't feed `em Pringles all the time. Okay?  Okay?  But you gotta get there quick, before the police, `cause T.J. will get scared. I don't want him to get scared, you know.  And don't let him jerk you around. Versailles, I mean.  Go with her. Okay?      How long is it for me. You know if I confess?  Will they get sent back?  Can I have a cigarette?  I got somebody.  A friend.  But I need to call my kid.",
