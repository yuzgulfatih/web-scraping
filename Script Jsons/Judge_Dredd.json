        "Judge": "Once again, Chief Justice,'you have served as a moral compass for all of us. I... withdraw my proposal. I hope ... for-good.  Judge Joseph Dredd. You are under arrest.  In here.  Stop Video.       they rush to open the cage and run inside!  You can't. He aims at Fergie!  ignoring the unarmed Fergie, he spins, FIRES -         McGruder, Evelyne. Council Judge. Authorize access to file, code name \"Janus\".  Esposito, Carlos. Council Judge. Authorize access to file, code name \"Janus\".  Dredd! I thought it was y-- That's all he says before Dredd K.O.'s him!     Totally caught by surprise.,.,they FIRE BACK for a second, but then Olmeyer's fusillade of RICOCHETING BULLETS sends them diving for cover!  While his comrades radio-report, he angrily stalks back to where Olme yer i s s i tting on the floor under guard.  You're under arrest, cadet. Anything you say will be held against you. Woozy from the blow to the head, Olmeyer nods, pleased.  You saved Mega-City, sir. You're a hero.",
        "Dredd": "strides calmly over to them.  He's firing a 64 laze pumper from six hundred feet. He couldn't hit me if I painted a bull's eye on my ass.  You - last. Dredd pushes Brisco behind Hershey. Turns toward Heavenly as re draws his massive LAWGIVER HANDGUN. Dredd speaks into the ::ny computer in the breech as he aims at the door.  Grenade. :'ï¿½BccM! The round knocks the steel door off its hinges. Dredd r:zxs :z aside and the Judges enter.  No. There.  This room is pacified. mcves carefully through the smoke. Behind him, Hershey and  spins around. Sees Brisco dead in the doorway. Snarls, enraged. Hershey whirls, KICKS down one of the wounded who tries to escape in the confusion.  You're all under arrest. Will you surrender, or would you like your trials now? a :.a_nsaw, and it's decimating Dredd's hiding place.        He's lost his Lawgiver! He reaches out for it - and gets kicked in the head! CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Twist, sudd enly courageous  Mega-City Municipal Code 334.8. Willful destruction of property. That's two years. WHAR:. He hits Zed in the face. Zed rocks, but stays up. He fries tc grab a nearby weapon, but Dredd kicks it away.  Code 11-5C. Illegal possession of assault weapons. Five years. Zed blocks Dredd's next blow; pulls him into a brutal embrace, slams Dredd against the walf. Again!  Code 7034-A. Resisting arrest. Twenty years. Dredd breaks free! Slams Zed once, twice. Zed flies back against the wall.  9804. Assault on a Judge with deadly intent.  We weren't expecting Zed's move. Dredd was. While we were blinking, he kicked a fallen weapon up from the floor and caught  No... Death. He FIRES at the same moment as Zed! Zed's shot hits Dredd's ARMOR, pings off. Dredd's shot hits Zed's heart.  Court is adjourned.  He made the mistake. Not you. Dredd cocks his head, listening. Somehow in the din and confusion he has heard something. He turns.      The guide wire in the floor isn't working.  Five! Four!  Mega-City Municipal Code 1286.4: Willful sabotage of a public servo-droid. That's six months, citizen. He grabs Fergie, pushes him against the wall.  - Let's see your Unicard.  FERGUSON, Herman. Forget six months: You've hacked into city droids, computers...  Cash machines, robot taxis... And you haven't even been out of jail for twenty four hours.  Not at all. You could have climbed out a window, worked your way down. Or found a turboshaft and shimmied down the cable.  Maybe. But it would have been legal. I sentence you to five years in. Aspen Penitentiary. Case closed. Take him away. s-': protesting, Fergie is hauled away. Hershey looks at Dredd.  Yes. And cowardice isn't one of them.   A rookie Judge died there, too. I guess he wasn't worth mentioning.    Chief Justice?  They were unavoidable, sir. Out there... that's the reality.  With all due respect, sir, how can you say that when you spend most of your time - D edd breaks off; he's said too much. But Fargo won't let him she hook.  At the Academy... Sir.  It.. doesn't matter what they say, Sir. You're the.Chief Justice of Mega City. If rt weren't for you and the others like you, we wouldn't have our justice system. There isn't a Judge in Mega-City who doesn't want to follow in your footsteps.  Kevlar nine helmet and body armor. WIDEN. Dredd is LECTURING to a group of CADETS who hang on his every word. We're in a TRAINING AREA like the one \"Q\" ran in the Bond movies. Dredd turns. A TECH nods: Target ready. Dredd FIRES a barrage of bullets at a mannequin in Judge's gear. The bullets ricochet off. The class OOOHS and AHHS.  Yours, when you graduate. If you graduate.   Lawgiver Two. Twenty five round sidearm with mission-variable voice programmed ammunition. Signal Flare. He turns, FIRES. The FLARE explodes on the wall. Again -000HS and AHHS.  Yours, when you graduate.  Now he moves to several Techs who are hurriedly tweaking the most awesome LAWMASTER CYCLE we've seen.  Mark IV Lawmaster, improved model. With on-board cannon, vertical take off and landing,. flight capacity and 500 kilometer range. The head Tech gives thumbs up while the other techs step back. The class waits, expectant. The lead tech throws a REMOTE. SPARKS fly. The motor COUGHS, dies. The class GROANS. Dredd glares at the embarrassed technicians.  Yours... if they ever get it to work. LAUGHTER. Dredd moves to a lectern. Faces the class.  All of these things are nothing but toys. Bottom line, final word, end of the day, when you're alone in the dark... all that counts... is this. takes something from the lectern shelf, throws it down. It's all-but holy book: THE LAW.  And you will be alone. Because when h T e': Frown; this is not what they expected to hear from a legend. They become increasingly unnerved.  For most of us t'here is only lonely death on the streets... or, for those few of us who survive to old age... the prouder loneliness of the Long Walk.     Life, Liberty, and the Pursuitof Happiness. Old and noble ideas. But they are what we give to (Xi others... not what we will ever receive for ourselves. Class dismissed. The class breaks up on a definite low note.      Really. How long since you saw any of them?  You've only been on the street a year. You're still in denial.  How many married Judges do you know?  Yes. Once.     Is this your car?  Of course not. Towing is the penalty for the first offense. This is your second violation.  Grenade.     They're Judge Hunters, Hershey. They're the ones who come out when a Judge has broken the Law. Hershey reacts; she's heard of them.  Judge Hershey. I don't have anyone else to ask... Will... will you be my defense attorney?  Murder. (X  That is the Law, Judge McGruder. I would expect no less.  Judge Hershey. I'm really glad I picked you to defend me.  I'm still glad. CAMERA FOLLOWS Hershey forward.  That kid barely knows me and he wants to save my ass.  They look at each other, as puzzled as everyone else. JUDGE DREDD 39 Rev. #2: 17/3/94  Do your job. She nods, stands.  You did your best, Judge Hershey. He stands, takes her hand.  Thank you.      Okay. W::.h a SNAP and without looking, Dredd jerks his elbow ba_xwards. The prisoner is knocked unconscious. As he sags in .is :hains, CAMERA ADJUSTS. The prisoner on the side of Dredd we haven't seen is Fergie. Now, he stares at Dredd. Then  I was convicted of a crime. Wrongly convicted.  No. You got the sentence the Law required. The Proper sentence.  The Law does not make mistakes.     Angel: Maybe if your youngest fruit hadn't taken those hostages he could be here for the family reunion. As one, all the Angels lunge forward as much as their short chains will allow. Fergie recoils; Dredd doesn't. But two GUARDS turn at the commotion. (X'  No.  Look out - Misunderstanding his intentions, the nearest guardZAPS him with his Stun Club! At the same moment, Pa Angel getsthe other guard's weapon, turns it on him! The guard DROPS.One of the Angel boys grabs the key card!  turns, charges forward - but two Angels have already whisked the key card over their cuff's ,canners! They tackle the guard!    punching, twisting, fighting the hands reaching for his throat. As the aircraft banks steeply, he slides alon the floor with his enemies. SEES a Judge's LAWGI trampled under the scrambling feet. Reaches for it - reaches - reaches -   Hack the shuttle, now! Fergie pushes the pilot's body aside, hits controls. Meanwhile the convicts are swarming against the cage door.  What the hell's wrong? JUDGE DREDD 52 Rev. #1: 16/4/94  CAMERA PUSHES IN on him.   Rico? That's impossible... O.S. SCREAM. Fergie wakes with a start, REACTS to the dramatic shafts of sunlight raking the cathedral ceiling.  You have just committed murder. The penalty isdeath. Reverend Angel HITS Dredd.  Ah... Fergie...  Actually, youre toast: I arrested the Angels oar Cannibalism. JUDGE DREDD 60 Rev. #1: 16/4/94  seeing this, he jumps up.    pulls the guy he's struggling with in front of him! The BULLETS hit him! Dredd wrenches the weapon from the man's dying fingers - SHOOTS the Hunter beside Fergie!  Fargo? BLOOD wells on Fargo's coat. e's been hit. As he sags, Dredd and Fergie rush towards him.H  No. You and the first Judges... you saved Mega-City.  But.., but the orphanage told me my parents were killed by lawbreakers -- they gave me that picture of them -  What do you mean, both times?  I have a... brother?     Like I trusted you?        To find Rico.   The vent from the city incinerator. There's a burst twice a minute. That means that there's 30 seconds for someone to run through the tube before it flames again.  Actually, they were burned to a crisp. But the theory's sound. Let's go. FOOM. Another FIREBALL belches from the city wall. As Fergie stares at it, Dredd starts forward. It's a few paces before he notices Fergie hasn't moved.  What's wrong?  Fergie. There's a maniac loose in  My fault?  The Law doesn't apologize.  I was when I sentenced you.  Run! C=ouched over, they race up the slight slope.  Stop counting!  FAINT light starts to fall on him. 'Then he SEES it, up ahead -the lights of Mega-City! Dredd pushes on - reaches the opening! Turns to look at..,-  He looks outside - so close - looks back - so far - it's impossible to save Fergie!  Dredd looks down - SEES  'v::.- a-= :he strength in his body, he RIPS the conduit free from =^e floor - YANKS it forward - As he shouts \"TWO\" he is whipped forward like a trout on a line!  Has landed half-buried in a mound of ashes. He looks around.  Fergie? Dredd hears a muffled SOUND beneath him. He reaches down... YANKS Fergie into view. Fergie spits out a mouthful of ashes.     I don't. But I trust the Council. When I tell them about Rico...        He shakes his head, gets up - sees Rico is gone, but Griffin is  You're mine.  They enter the training center and Dredd runs right towards the ,--_ Marie IV Lawmaster! Leaps into the saddle and kicks over the en=ine! Spins around and heads back the way he came, grabbing =ergie en route!  Turns again - he's flanked! He spins on the bike, takes the only direction left: Back into the training room - a dead end. Al; the Judges and Guards follow, BLASTING away.  He races directly for the WALL! His fingers stretch out, hit a control marked \"CANNON\".         Hershey. What is it - ?  You think I'm-part of this - r^ 40 CONTINUED: 24C        Him... and Griffin.  There is no Council, Hershey: They were all murdered an hour ago.  The same. Inhuman. Defective. He just broke down, first.  How many times have you said I had no feelings, no emotions? Now you know why.  It's not the same! They had parents, they embraced their humanity... they didn't hide it... fight it... question it!   Myself. Griffin. Fargo. Even Fergie. I've been wrong about so much...   Hershey. You just said I was never wrong about the Law. They took away my badge. I'm a convicted murderer. I have no authority any more - no legal authority. Pause. without the law as a safety net, Dredd is in uncharted emotional territory.  Will ...wi11 you help me, Hershey? Not as a Judge but... but... as my friend? ::'s the most ordinary request anyone could make... anyone but Dredd. Hershey understands how much it means. She fights back :ears, puts her hand on his arm.  Central, I order you to give me the location of the Janus Lab, immediately! By now the CAMERA is in Olmeyer's student pod. Olmeyer, Fergie and Hershey are in a corner, watching and whispering. : edd is on the other side of the cubicle, at a Central Station. ' r e's wearing his own helmet and badge again.     You're helping them?  But they're breaking the law! Who the hell programmed you?  Fine! I'll file charges!     Fergie, you've got to have something - a password, a kluge -  Come on, you cracked the food robot... the shuttle computer -  Scared..?  First that Goddamn computer turned on me. Then, you! CRASH! Fergie's head hits a LIGHT FIXTURE. The bulb EXPLODES.  That's the idea! Another BULB EXPLODES.   The Lab was top secret. It had to be in an out of the way place to stay secret. Right?     Red Quad, Section 5: The oldest part of Mega-City. Olmeyer turns, looks off.  What?  Almost at the flying cycle. Hershey hesitates at the shots. Dredd grimly pushes her towards the bike.               No.  Edsel, here still has another     I'm nothing like you.  Dredd reacts, startled to hear this twisted version of his own earlier words.  Drawn despite himself, he stands beside Rico, head turned up like his clone brother's. They never looked more alike. Dredd looks into the glass of the Incubator Chambers just above him. Inside, still forming HUMAN SHAPES, male and female, suspended in milky fluid.  You get nothing from me, Rico. You've betrayed the Law.  When Aspen thaws, Rico. Go to hell. Tense seconds. Rico grins boyishly, lowers the gun.  whirls, FIRES down at Rico. Rico dives for cover... manages to grab his Lawgiver! He FIRES back up at Dredd!  He's trying to keep Rico at bay, but he's clearly outgunned. Reloading behind cover, he SEES Fergie in the doorway. Crawls over to him. Fergie's ashen, his shirt soaked with blood.  Fergie.  I. I made a mistake. I... I'm sorry I misjudged you.  And I'll never arrest you again.    He's a one man mobile artillery charge, AIMING, FIRING and snou;..nq commands to his computerized weapon!       fumbling along in the smoke. Suddenly another half-formed CLONE rears up in his face! It mews horribly, clutches at him! Dredd FIRES a burst at it. It fa s away, vanishes in the smoke!  Rico. Dread is on top of a big console.  Here comes the Judge. - -IVES down on Rico! Each man grabs each other's wrists! h T e Lawgivers both FIRE wildly. Dredd and Rico carom off ec:uâ¢ pment , FALL!  The round HITS HIM like a pile driver! His SHIRT catches FIRE! He falls backwards over a railing as the SMOKE coils upwards!  On the floor below, chest blackened, trying to catch his breath. He REACTS as the lights go out. Seeing a LIGHT in the smoke, he crawls to it. His face falls when he sees its one of Central's  Central! Can you -  Okay, you win. I'll give myself up to Chief Justice Rico. Where is he?    That's for Fargo! That's for the u Co ncil! That's for Fergie!  Signal Flare! And as he SHOUTS it, he uses his last strength to smack the weapon away!  He watches his brother fall. Starts to climb up... a boot steps on his hand. He looks up. bruised, bloody - angry! Then - WHAM! A FIST SMASHES into her  .. It's over.  No. Just a Judge. I did my job.

We have reached a verdict. In the charge of Pre-meditated Murder, we the Jury find Joseph Dredd GUILTY as charged. GASPS from the audience. It's the fall of a Legend.      Now the street criminals are taking advantage of the situation. It's a nightmare!  Come on, Griffin! A new batch of test tube babies won't solve this crisis! We don't need reliable Judges 20 years from now when they're grown! We need them today!  Who knows if that's even possible?  Esposito, Carlos. Council Judge.

        "Ilsa": "Pathetic. She turns to leave... stops when she sees the amused eyes of the man watching her from four feet away: Rico.       The research ended when they condemned you. I live here, now. You showed me that facing death was the only way to live. Her eyes glisten as she moves towards Rico, touches his arm.  They... they told me you were dead. ?_cc reaches out gently. . .wipes a tear from her cheek.  Lights! About time - eyes narrow as Ilsa comes in from another area with a ï¿½oboard.  Since then I've learned innocence is just another lie. And that the best truths come only with pain.  And... speaking of painful truths... Here's our shopping list. She hands Griffin the digital notepad.  Mine too. Rico turns, whistles at the robot like it's a dog.  What are you doing?  I've test driven him. It's true.  I'd like to be a fly on that wall.     jumps to her feet - right into Hershey's fist!  still fighting. Ilsa gets in one, two terrific blows.  Bitch!",

She is exchanging her battered helmet. Now, she notices Dredd, lingers to watch, impressed witn his style.  Forget it, Olmeyer. I'm not gonna be the yearbook Centerfold!  No, let me show yoou a dummy. She turns his head so he can SEE his reflection. When he turns back - she's gone.  She sees Dredd at an end locker. Decides. Approaches him.  Judge Dredd? He looks at her, waiting.    Well, I think your truth is relative. I have a personal life. I have lots-of friends.     It's not that bad.  Uh, well, my class is young. None of them have found the right... person. e lust looks at her.  Has it really been like that for you? Haven't you ever been in - Haven't you ever had a... friend?  What happened?  Dredd?

You're under.indictment? For what?  Objection, Your Honor. This video is inadmissible as evidence.  That is the State's interpretation. Replay dialogue. _ï¿½EC rewinds. Then:  Stop video. Do you hear it? When Lily Hammond says \"Dredd\", it's part of the conversation. And when Vardis Hammond,,sa s 'Dredd' it could just as easily be the same. The suggestion that either has recognized their murderer is sheer supposition... or, in the case of the prosecution, wishful-thinking! BIG REACTION from the packed room. Griffin bangs the gavel for silence. THE DEFENSE TABLE 1r Hershey returns here to get another document. Dredd WHISPERS.  You only picked me because you didn't have anyone else.  It clearly shows nothing! Your Honor, I have here an affidavit from Cadet Olmeyer, currently a Junior at the Academy. Svc IN THE AUDIENCE 102 heads of the other cadets around him swivel to look at him .:_` new regard. He does his best to look cool.  Cadet Olmeyer is acknowledged by all his instructors to be an expert in the field of still and video graphics. His affidavit states that this surveillance video is of such low definition that even after all known enhancements are used, no positive identification can be made of the killer. Since the uniform of a Judge could be counterfeit, I repeat my objection to this video being entered as evidence in this case.  I ask for a ruling.  returns to the defendant's table as the court quiets down. Olmeyer WHOOPS a second longer than everyone else. Embarrassed, he quiets down, but not before Dredd notices him.,  Trust me. It's not your ass he's interested in.  They look at each other, as puzzled as everyone else. JUDGE DREDD 39 Rev. #2: 17/3/94   DNA evidence is irrefutable!  Your Honor... the defense rests.  Dredd. I... I'm sorry.  Dredd..!   Well. Baby Dredd.  She's puzzled - quite clearly, she has no idea who Rico is.           Central, I need to access the graphics database.  This should be a little faster:     Central? Central? Hello?  The Dance? You want me to go to the Go amn Junior Dance?  We're trying to save Judge Dredd, and you're using the situation to blackmail me. That's disgraceful!   Yes!  Yes! Just do'it!  Olmeyer, you stupid futz! You analyzed the wrong picture!  You were supposed to do this one! You just wasted three hours! c-_rrputer BEEPS. MESSAGES run by the bottom of the screen.  What?  You mean... it's not real?   Yes, patch me in!  You can start by telling me why Dredd's baby picture is a state secret. Pause. We can almost hear Central thinking. Meanwhile, behind Hershey, a figure in a Judge's uniform approaches her Bike...  Central. I want an answer.     Mc%,inc carefully, Dredd and Fergie walk down the corridor. Dredd's still in the stolen uniform. They come to a nameplate with Hershey's name on it. ,We WIDEN. The door has been forced oiler..  Up against the wall, now! The figure complies. It's Fergie.     Dredd! '_- a moment she's elated. Then her face hardens. She holds n steady.  Stay where you are.  They're dying out-there, Dredd. A hundred and eight Judges in 48 hours. Everyone who's left is on triple shifts and pseudorphin. I thought it was organized criminals, revolutionaries, something... then I was a target.  I don't know what to think anymore. Dredd moves like lightning - pins her gun hand against the wall - then freezes. It's a challenge, not a threat. She glares at him - counter moves - gets an elbow against his throat! But Dredd doesn't break her hold - or turn the gun on her. It's deliberate check-mate on both their parts.  Secrets can hurt more than anything. She relaxes her hold on him. Throws something down.  Tell me about him, Dredd. Make me believe in you again the way I did when I defended you.  And he's doing it again?  Griffin? We have to tell the Council - !  She's been on her feet for days and this is the last psychic blow. She sags. Dredd catches her.        No!    Dredd. The Janus project didn't do that to you. You did that to yourself. He turns, startled. Realizes she's right.  Never the Law, Dredd. Never the Law. That means more than anything else she can say to him. He looks into her eyes. Fergie comes in, ends the moment.  I'd be honored. Dredd reaches over, squeezes her hand. There's absolutely nc:n.nc sexual about it - and that makes it even more powerful.  Central. This is Judge Hershey. I hereby file formal charges of murder against Chief Justice Griffin and Council Judge Rico. And I order you to give me the location of the Janus Lab so that I may personally make the arrest!  Dredd, you're scaring him!  Central! I need to see the city power grid!  Scan through all the grid sections. Random selection.

S::rprised by the darkness, Ilsa falls, sliding on the slick floor. TILT up. Hershey, limping, comes towards her. :lsa foot-sweeps her to the floor!  Grenade. BLAM! The incubators EXPLODE.

        "Rico": "Hello, Warden.  Have you come for another... chat?  \"Innocent\"? A meaningless word. The innocent exist only until they inevitably become perpetrators themselves. In the end, \"Guilt\" and \"Innocence\" are merely a matter of timing.  Am I? When did you become a perpetrator? Was it the time you found money mysteriously transferred into your account? Or the time I was sentenced to death? You've been taking bribes for years, Warden. You're a criminal. And a stupid one: You don't even know who's paying you.

I see you're still researching the dark night of the soul.  Don't go woosy on me, Professor. We got work to do. He puts his arm around her. They step over her victim on their way out.

    "description": "In the year 2139, the Earth has changed into a virtually uninhabitable place called the Cursed Earth. All of the Earth's population have crowded into the cities across the planet, now known as Mega-Cities. The crimes in these Mega-Cities became so violent and so powerful, that the regular justice system was powerless to contain, then it collapsed completely. However, a new justice system came from the ashes, there were three justice systems in one (police, jury and executioner), they were called Judges. In Mega-City One (formerly, New York City), there was a Judge, named Joseph Dredd, who was the toughest and most stringent Judge in history. One day, he was charged with murder, and was tried and sentenced to life in prison because of it.—John Wiggins",
