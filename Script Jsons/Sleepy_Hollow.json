        "Lady": "You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?    Good morrow, Constable.  Returning to the Western Woods?  Use caution.  As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo. Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.  Doctor, he is awake.  No.  She has gone out.  She has taken the last of our grain to be milled. You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?  Will you look at this?  I cut my hand this morning: I sewed it myself, but I am afraid it will go bad.  Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?    I know you followed last night.  You must promise not to tell Baltus...  Have mercy on me.  Please... have mercy.  Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?  And, quite beautifully done, wouldn't you say?  It is almost over.    He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.  The precious servant girl Sarah.  I killed her and kept her body hidden, till I needed it.  And, when I return to the Hollow tomorrow, my version of the truth will come to pass. I mean, there I was that fateful day, following Baltus into the woods.  I did not know what he was up to... where he was going.  I worried for his safety.  Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.  This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me...  He will have that honor.    And, tomorrow is my grand performance, having barely survived the elements... By sheer luck I found my way back to the Hollow.  But... what do I find here... ?  My dear, sweet step-daughter Katrina is dead.  Why has God forsaken her?    You've been a naughty girl.  Little bitch.  Run, Katrina!  Fast as your pretty legs will carry you.  It makes no difference.  Nothing will stop him now!  Olly-olly oxen-free!  Should have stayed away, Constable.  Keep back, or I kill her.  See him...  You cannot kill what is already dead.  Yes... yes.  I think I will...  Say goodbye to her.",
        "Crane": "",
        "Magistrate": "Yes, must we?",
        "Philipse": "Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.  Cut off his head with his own sword. It's a legend told for twenty years.  Gather round!  Gather and quiet! The hour has come to choose for this night.  Each man's name is in this box and has been checked.  May the Lord watch over him... \"Jonathan Masbath.\"  Are you here?  Someone leave him a horse.  And now Jonathan Masbath.  He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.  Van Ripper there...  ... found the body this morning. You do believe now, don't you?  You need less big words, and more common sense.  My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.     Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.  We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.    No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...  What will it take for you to realize this is no laughing matter?  Oh my... oh my oh my oh my...",
        "Notary": "",
        "Hardenbrook": "Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.       I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.  Certainly... certainly.  Hmm?  See them?  Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.  A fine idea.  Damn... damn... damn...  Well... that might be... helpful.",
        "Killian": "Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.  No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.  Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.  The Widow Windsor.  It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.  Listen to me!  Do you want to save your crops?  Or would you rather see your farms go to ruin?     Do you deserve to be?           I am a bad habit.  There's nothing for it.                        Beth...            Beth... run!",
        "Reverend": "",
        "Steenwyck": "Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?  The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.  It is very clear why.  Citizens here have long tried to hide sins behind closed doors.  Their failed faith has saturated the soil and called forth one of Satan's own.  It is sacrilege!  Magistrate Philipse, surely you can stop this.  I will not allow it.  I will not!  Your superiors are two days away!  The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane. The Lord will not forgive your sins.  For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?  You all stand idle, while this man goes about with a book of secrets and a bag filled with magic.  You all stand idle, while the shadow of the Devil falls over our town.  I say, if you do nothing, you share in the blasphemy of Ichabod Crane!  How is he saving our farms?  How? Ichabod Crane has brought into our midst the soulless, moldering corpse of a heretic!  Let her burn!  Let her burn!  Are you Ichabod Crane's protector, Brom Bones?  You side with him in this?     You are astonishing, Constable.  Do you truly think your ridiculous accusations frighten me?  No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.  Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.  I am the Lord's voice in this town.  They need guidance.    You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!  My friends... dear friends.  Those of you still on your farms, I thank you for coming.  I... I address unfortunate business. I am forced to take my leave from Sleepy Hollow.  I will be moving on to do the Lord's work elsewhere.",
        "Beth": "Don't pick teeth.  You teach Thomas bad habits.    What are you doing there?  Don't let him get you.  You hide now... go...",
        "Ichabod": "Yes, it is me.  But, not only me... I found someone here...  Someone quite dead.  Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.  There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...  I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.  There is nothing heretical about science, sir.  The Chinese have written on it for hundreds of years... procedural study used to solve seemingly unsolvable crimes.  Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.  Without disrespect, look around you. We overflow.  As do our courts.  But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?  Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?  Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.  Chosen me?  Not for lack of trying.       Such a day for such a sad farewell. But, this is goodbye, my sweet.      Excuse me, Miss... They have a laugh at your expense.  I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.  Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.  I have been sent from the city with a letter of introduction. I am told you offer me room and board.  If we could speak alone.  An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?  I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?  The militia?  All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...  Pardon me?  Just a moment... Are you saying it is he?  Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?  Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.  While I will do everything I can to find your assassin, I will look for a man of flesh and blood.  Not some goblin-demon from hell.  You worry for naught, little man. Nothing will harm him there. It is problems here on the ground you people need begin to worry about.     Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?  Feel free to form your own opinion. Though it appears you already have.  Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...  Small talk.  Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.  The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call \"friend,\" he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.  Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was \"no\" at least once.  Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.     Are you so superstitious?  There is no such thing as magic.  Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.  The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...    Believe?  It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.  What is that you wear?  Well... so much for common sense.  Who took the meat?  These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.  Why did you move the body, Doctor?    Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?  To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?  There was not much blood, was there?  No bleeding.  This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....  It instantly burnt the wound shut.  I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.  I manage fine alone.    Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.  What are you spying on?     He is a behemoth.  More than enough, actually. I beg you, no more, please.  Tell me something. What becomes of Young Masbath?  Find yourself a place in the servants' residence and wake me before dawn. Our first task will be an unsavory one.  I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.  Protest to my superiors if you like.  Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.  Why was I not told of this?  Is that all you say?  Look at her.  What is the common thread between these victims?  We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.  The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ? Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.  In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.  You should step outside.                         Sorry for disturbing you.  I thought a forgotten candle was burning.  May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?  I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.  I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.  Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it. The bird seems to be in his cage.  He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...  Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.  If you want.  But...  Thank you.  No.  Here...    Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?  I know it.  Listen to what you say....  At times I do.  Philipse!                       No... mother... no... !              If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?  They have done nothing of the sort.  Two days... ?  For murder?  Does that look like an animal hanging?  Wait.  Give me a moment...      The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.  His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself. Someone out there cared for him.  Up.  What is it?    Look again.  Are you familiar with magnets?  Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.    I have others.  All I need is this.    If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.  Witches do not exist.  However...  Not long ago, I would have said the same for Headless Horseman.  No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...  You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.  The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.  There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.  It was not butchery.  I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.  To avenge his father, and the others.    What is it?    We have apparently arrived.  Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?  In a way, yes.  The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman? I should tell you... he has been murdered.  The Horseman.  Yes.  Can you help?  What... what are you doing?  Excuse me... um...  Are you alright... ?  We are leaving.  How could something named \"the tree of the dead\" fail to draw attention?  We should not go much further in this murk.  We are far from the Hollow. Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.  \"Let loose his silent shrieking.\" Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out. \"He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand.\" Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.    What God-forsaken hell is this?  Christ...  The wound is neither smooth nor cauterized, but jagged.  She bleeds like a fountain.  She did not go quietly.  What are you doing?  I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.  I hit him square.           She was with me, father.  She was with me that night.     May I see her?  May I see my mother?  She did not do it... please listen...  No, sir, please... she is innocent...  No.              Mother.          Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.  No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.  Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.  She is not your birth mother, is she?  What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?  Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now. Lord, how I hate this place.  I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.  Yes, actually.    Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?  I should be going... good day to you.  You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.    Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.  Quicken pace.  Ride on.  Halt and turn.  I have a pistol aimed at your head.  Katrina.  Why do you follow?  A woman should not be out alone in these woods.  Come along.  Blood.  Stay back.  Just... keep where you are.  He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.  Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?  Why this tree?     It cannot be true.  Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?  Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.  This is his silent shrieking... and his desire, to reclaim his head.  \"He who holds fast the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand.\" Someone controls the Horseman.  His next victim is chosen! Give me distance, then guide her back to the Hollow.  For what it's worth...  Look.       ... Brom Bones...  Bring Young Masbath here.  Bring him.         Man or woman?  Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.  Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul. We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?  Damn it.  Wait...  Panic has set in.  Sanctuary.  Or, so they hope.  Do you have these persons' wills?  Yes, sir... but, do you have these?  May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?  May we look at them now?  Maybe you should take this.  To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.  Master Hardenbrook...  Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?    Then look here at your father's will, and tell me why you are not listed.  Van Garrett had denoted his elder son in his last wishes; the same son murdered along with him.  But Van Garrett's wife and two infant children are not written... and they were spared. Do you see?  Philipse had no family to bestow his farm to.  But, here... The Widow Windsor was listed on her late husband's will.  After her inheritance, she amended the document to include her bastard child.  This is why the Horseman made absolutely certain to impale the unborn descendant.  Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.  No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.  Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.  Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?  Did your father take a loan?  Tonight, we answer questions.  And, to discover who moves about the Van Tassel house after dark... all we need is a candle.        Midnight seems an appropriate time.      Keep looking.  Then, hide in my room and bolt the door till I return.     Lady Van Tassel.  Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?    It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her. It is absolutely nothing.  Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.  Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.  Where?  Very little.  I must be going...  It appears well.  It has already clotted.  It is fine.  Now, I must...  What... ?  How did you hear this?  I appreciate your concern.  I thank you, sir.  Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.  Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must... Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.  Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.  It is only important what you are. An adulterer...  Wallowing in sin and lust...  Wallowing quite literally in blood.  He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.  You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.  Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.  Come with me.  Explain these.  I found them secreted away in the sewing room.  Why... why have I scrambled and run and clawed in all directions, only to find you against me?  It was you there?  And, what did he say?  What did he say, Katrina?  The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.  What would you have me believe?  The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.  Katrina...  Stop this!  The Horseman cannot enter!  It does not matter who he wants, he cannot cross the gate!   (looking at corpse,  You will stay at her side?  I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.     Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.     Half now.  Half when we reach the city.  This is farewell.  I cannot. You should not worry. Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.  I am sorry. Forgive me.  I failed you.                    Van Ripper, turn the coach about!  Turn around.  Now!  Pardon the intrusion...  I never examined these bodies.  Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.  Stains of blood.  Jagged flesh. The Horseman did not do this.  Here, Doctor.  Hold this just so...  No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.  When this cut was made, this person was already dead. This is not Lady Van Tassel.  Open the door.  Open up, damn it! Lady van Tassel is alive.  The Horseman is her puppet.  Please...  Listen to me.  Lady Van Tassel has faked her death.  I need able men...  No...  Van Ripper... do you have a gun?  May I see it?  Get down.  Hurry!  Sorry.  Katrina!  Climb up!  I know.  Hold on.  Christ.  I do not know.  Away.  We might make it to the church.  Damn it, boy, get back here!  Take the reins.  Masbath is right.  We must do something.  Keep him off!  Block him!  Take it!  Move forward!  Go!  Help her.  I doubt that's the end.  He moves too fast.  His horse.  There...  He's coming!  Hurry!  Get up those stairs.  Open the door to the roof and wait.  Keep climbing.  I will follow...    No. Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.  The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.  We have no choice.  Be ready...  Now!  Okay... come on...    Let her go!  No!  Horseman!  How are you?",

There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.  I was getting worried.  Who was it?  What was she doing?  No.  They are all missing.  There is more, though.  While you were gone, I could hear someone else walking through the house.  Here.  There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.  What books?  But, sir... what books?  Where are they?  If there is a secret place for books... it could be just as good for the missing loan agreements.  Constable.  Fie!  Here they are.    She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir?  Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?  Why... why are you like this?  Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.  Do not go, Constable.  How can you leave?  Hello?  Katrina?  Katrina. Is anyone here?  She commands the Horseman.  Then, whose body was it... ?  Here we are!

There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.  I was getting worried.  Who was it?  What was she doing?  No.  They are all missing.  There is more, though.  While you were gone, I could hear someone else walking through the house.  Here.  There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.  What books?  But, sir... what books?  Where are they?  If there is a secret place for books... it could be just as good for the missing loan agreements.  Constable.  Fie!  Here they are.    She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir?  Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?  Why... why are you like this?  Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.  Do not go, Constable.  How can you leave?  Hello?  Katrina?  Katrina. Is anyone here?  She commands the Horseman.  Then, whose body was it... ?  Here we are!  Lady Van Tassel...  Here he comes!  What can we do?  What now?  It won't hold.  Look out!  Jump?  Jump where?  Tired.",

Do you see the Redskinned bastard?  A diseased monster.      I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.               Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.  He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.  You need to sleep.  You need rest.  It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.           ... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.  What of it?  What?",

Spearheaded by the eager Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) and his new-world ways into the quagmire of secrets and murder, secrets once laid to rest, best forgotten, and now reawakened, and he too, holding a dark secret of a past once gone.—Cinema_Fan",
