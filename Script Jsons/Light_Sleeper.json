        "Teresa": "Have you ever been to a psychic before?  Do you need advice? John?  Be comfortable. How did you hear about me?  It's a lot of money?      Your livelihood is endangered. You're worried about the future. You don't have much money saved. What will you do?  I see a woman who has betrayed you.    Keep it in mind. I have a strong feeling about this woman, a woman close to you, she will betray you. You're in the entertainment business, aren't you?  But you're not happy. You want to do something else. Is it music?  You have a talent for music.  You still have it. It's strong. I see music in your future. A career opportunity will come in the music field. Take it. It won't seem promising. Take it anyway. You're full of stress. Are you exercising?  You should exercise more. You must let go of this stress. It's not good for your health. I'm not saying you're going over to the other side, but it's not good for you. You're still drinking, aren't you? You have a drinking problem? It's interfering with your health and your life too. You've had other problems. Drug addiction.  This was very important in your life.  You are in the balance. Everything you do -- positive or negative -- in this life is a drop that will carry over in the next. Every act, every decision matters.  What is it?  You're young.  I see a glow. Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside you.            Do I know you?    Step back. Again. Death.  This was not an accident. This person was murdered.    I can't see it.  Yes. Don't be afraid. Go home.  Nothing. Forget it. Let me sleep.",
        "Ann": "Darling.  Have we made New York safe for another weekend?  Any hundreds?  Goddamn cash machines.  These Wall Street kids deal with fake money all day, they think cash is a theoretical concept -- like it doesn't apply. I see 'em at two, shudder to think at nine they're buying and selling -- turned me off the stock market.    Sleep tight.        The face cream. Almond, marigold, chamomile, egg, aloe -- the \"Almilk\" formula. I remixed it.  Reminds me, if you get downtown stop at Enhancements and pick up some almond oil -- not the California. What should we order?  Darling, it's Saturday.  \"Hello. This is Ann. If you leave a message, we'll get back to you -- sooner than you think.\"    \"Ped Srilom\"? -- it's Northeastern. Duck.  Laugh, one day you'll be watching me on \"Oprah\" from a welfare hotel.    Good for the trees --    Take a coat. And you, clean up the product before the food delivery comes.        I'm not supposed to be around --  It's four years I'm clean. No alcohol, no cigarettes, no nothing.  It's still not easy.    But you're dealing.  What's in the bag?  What's that for? In case someone needs almond oil in the middle of the night?    Goodbye, John.           Shalom. See you next week. Don't eat any hot dogs!  It's all over the news.  We are careful.      One o'clock. CÃ´te Basque. Is that too early?  Fine.     Thanks.  Yeah.  I don't think that would be a good idea.  One of us has to be here.  I shouldn't.   She liked you. You know this will happen someday, but when it does... Your mother -- that was a shock.  A year.    It's... I don't want you to know about my life.  Details just open the door.  We were not.  He wasn't even a minister. He was an astrologer.  He was a Pisces.  It was not legal.  I was on the cusp.  We were miserable. We were either scoring or coming down -- mostly coming down.  You took off for three months without telling me and called once. That's how magical we were. You were an encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies -- I heard them all. Nobody could clear a room like you, John. And the friends, you may have noticed, turned out to be mine, not yours. I envy you. A convenient memory is a gift from God.  In rehab they call this \"euphoric recall.\" You only remember the highs, never the lows.  I was drowning.  You watched --  You did nothing -- \"It wasn't your business, you weren't responsible\" -- you still think like that. Actions have consequences; so do --  -- inactions.  You always meant well.  Yes.  Ann? I'll believe it when I see it.  Are you really straight?  Let me see your eyes.  Eyes are deceiving. Congratulations.  What do you mean?    You're crazy.  I have to get back.  You have any money saved?  What do you do with your money?    Kitty Ford once told me, \"Ann, the only person I know that lives as well as you is my grandmother.\" All the money I've made, all the money I've spent -- it never adds up. This last two years cosmetics' been taking everything.  You still go to meetings?  Ask Robert to make up a chart for you; the other person -- who is it?  What's the plan?  What you gonna do?  Too conceptual?  This time it's for real.  You took that before.    I have feelings too -- you may have noticed. I guess I'm worried. I'm tough, you gotta to be tough, especially in this business, it's one thing to act tough -- I've seen Zipporah twice this week.         It'll be strange without you around. I hadn't thought of it -- it hit me.    It's like a joke. It's not a real feeling. It's like a feeling of a feeling.  You tried to kill me. You took ten years of my life one way or another. I couldn't hate my mom -- I was too busy hating you.  I remember.  What it felt like. What this tasted like.  John.  Come. Come with me.  Not with you.  Such an erection.  Weird.  I'm dripping.  Kiss, kiss, kiss.  This is the end. It was wonderful. I'm glad it happened this way. It will never happen again. You will not see me, you will not call me again. I'm happy for you. I wish you the best. I'm leaving. I'm going back to the hospital. I shouldn't have left -- but I don't regret it. Please dress and leave as soon as possible. I have a key. Goodbye.  It's my fault.  Johnny, what is this? Your beeper broke, gettin' some shiatsu? Two hours: where have you bee?  How you gonna survive on your own? The U.N.'s got some conference in two days. The holiday's over -- ragheads everywhere trying to score. U.N. security at every hotel -- little creeps with lapel pins. Even I've been out. This is where our money is: Europe, Asia, not the streets -- you wouldn't know crack from crackerjacks.  Busting his ass. He's out doing your job.  Get confused on your day off.  Don't get wise. What do you want me to do? Suck your dick? -- okay. A raise? No way. Get out there. There's a list on the TV. I love you. Get your ass outta here before I kiss it.    Get out.      Have some shu mai. Just delivered.  About what?  What's wrong baby? You like like shit. Something wrong?  You can't fool me. I can read you.    Who knows what will happen?      It's --      Spring roll.  The Prodigal Son.  Where were you?     The label for the cosmetics line.    Yeah. Says you were supposed to show up again yesterday, but didn't.  Can't. He's the Ecstasy connect. No way I can fuck this.  This is business.  Tis won't deal with fags.  Just is -- so he's a bigot? What's new? So's everybody else.         It's going to be strange, not doing this. I mean I've had it, but sometimes...    You know, when we first started out of the place on Greene Street. Before deliveries, when you were still using. It was open house every night but Sunday. We had everything: uppers, downers, meth, six kinds of hash, all in that trousseau, remember? You could get in for a gram, stay all night -- everybody, music people, movies, Wall Street, fashion -- even politics. I think like five marriages came out of those parties, babies -- really. God. You stayed, you then Robert -- but he... I'da never thought you'd, what is it, twelve years? Others, lucky a year max, eight months, in, out, start using, unreliable -- nice kids. Remember when you first came: long hair, dirty fingers --  -- never washed --  I should write a book someday. Did you know somebody wanted to do my story? Ghostwrite. It was impossible, of course -- my lawyer freaked I even had the meeting. People envy me. They think my life is so glamorous, but they don't know. I know. Glamorous. It was for a while. Then came crack and fucked everything.  Why? It's out of the way. They're expecting you.    Oh. Okay.  That took long enough. What did you do, douche while you were at it?  You don't want to know where it's been. Cologne?  Phew. It smells like that stuff they give you on airplanes. It's no good for your skin. All chemicals.  What's that?  What?  What is it?    We are. He's here. He can't very well work out of his apartment after what happened yesterday, can he?       Twelve-oh-four.  I told you greasy fucks I don't deal with guns! I see guns, I walk! How dare you?  And you, beaner, whoever the fuck you are, kiss my fat ass!       Hi.  I look respectable. Any news?  It feels like forever.  I love your letters.  Robert quit. He went back to dealing. I think he thought it would be less work, more money. It's lucky in a way I got mixed up in it -- now I have to see this thing through. So it's cosmetics after all.  Me too.  What do you mean?    You had a hard-on...  You tried...  Me too.",
        "Manuel": "How'd you get in?  You buying?    Piece? Piece of what? Piece of candy?  When?  How much you spend?  He's got a 64 Smith-son. Detective Special. Nobody wants 'em.

        "Tis": "You got some valiums?  Just a valium -- a ten.  You won't believe it. What a nightmare. I brought in this chick. She O.D.ed -- man, I didn't even know her. I didn't have to bring her in. The cops are coming back to talk to me. I'm hyper. I gotta come down.  Make it two.  Thanks.  Who?  Yeah, yeah. Met her last night. A walking vacuum cleaner. What a nightmare. Underage.  (gestures toward suited man  Tour, sit. Take a rest. LeTour, this is Gabri, Tasha -- you know Thomas. They're here for a show.     No problem, but -- can you believe this? -- she's out of the hospital in one day, calls me up, wants to \"get together.\" Some people are just born for losing. Want to go in back?  Huh?  You know him?  No. Need help?  Forget it. It wasn't for me anyway. Who am I trying to impress? Make it tomorrow. A half -- no, three- quarters.  Nineteen is fine.  Tour, just in time. We were out. Nineteen, right?  Some, not the whole thing. You got hundreds?  I like that about Ann. Always takes the time to grind it. If you do it, do it right.

        "Robert": "Get a job.  Tens!  Did what's-his-name give you a hard time?  Yeah.  Fucking investment bankers.  It's over.  Pick up the trash.  Jack.  You pick up from Jealous?  We don't make the laws. Nineteen is carrying, twenty is dealing. Let him be stupid.    The Ecstasy connection. From Arizona. She's trying to get them to come here -- or, better, Europe.  All mark-up -- the \"Big One.\"  That's what she says. New Year's Eve and out -- no Acid House, no product, no deliveries.  Next year -- strictly Akasha.  Cosmetics.

They go way back -- before me. Did you cross him?  Don't. He's Ann's Ecstasy connection. She needs that score. What happened?  Don't mess with him.  Everybody's dangerous. We heard what you did to Eddie. Ann thought it was great. She was afraid that was why you didn't come back.  About what?  Tis who? Ann says you want a chart done. What's wrong?    What?  Compared to what? My thinking this or that is going to make any difference? There's a plan unfolding. \"Will my plane crash?\" \"Does life have meaning?\" -- why ask me? Thinking's a fear of living, negative living; living's something else. You're afraid. Let the plan unfold. Stop. Stop, live one day -- one day --  -- day at a time.

White drugs for white people. Twice the price, twice the safety.  Never made any big money either.  She blows it.  She always says that. We'll see, Jealous.  No way. I'm not the management type.

Is there anything? Is it dark? Have I run out of luck? Is there luck?  Jealous said something about a yuppie murder in the Park. You know anything about it?  Jealous said to be careful.  A hospital? What's he doing there?  The --?  Me?  No. Yeah -- sure.  I vote Japanese.    What's going on?    What is it?    She okay?  The girl.  You need a lawyer?  Any time.  Randi?    Serious?

We were happy?  You bought it for me. It's inscribed inside.  Ann's quitting. I've got to find something else to do.  It's true.  Yeah.  If I could do that, I could do anything.  We could do anything. We could start over.  I'm serious.    I'll walk you.    There's some. Not much. A thousand or two. Maybe more -- I'm not sure.  I don't know. It's not that much in the first place -- as you know.  Rent, utilities, phone, tips, CDs -- what about your money?  I wish I could help.  No, but I'm okay. What are the odds of meeting someone you haven't seen in years twice in two days?  Just a contact -- you don't know him.  The plan?  My future?  We had this conversation two years ago. We'll have it two years from now.    That was acting.  Why all this concern? Suddenly you care?  She helps you?  You --? Of course I will.

Undercover, whatever -- he's on you.      Nineteen is the top. I'll make two trips.      Marianne Jost, please.  Marianne Jost.  She was there yesterday.  Did she leave a forwarding number?  Thank you.  Mrs. Jost. JoAnn Jost. She's a patient.    Are the funeral arrangements local?  Thank you.  Can I help you, officer?  I hope I haven't made a mistake. You are a cop, aren't you?  Could I see a badge?  What is it?  My father's a partner in a powerful law firm. If you have anything in mind, do it by the book.    I wish I could help. I don't even know who's president.  Marianne...  Marianne...  I didn't...  It's...  How are you?  Yes, you. I can't think of anything, but if there was anything I could do...  I saw her.  Your mother. I came in the room.

What should I do?  Please. Am I lucky?  What do I owe you?  Bill Guidone, please. Homicide.  This is John LeTour. Remember me?  You said I should ask around, tell you something you didn't know.  It ain't much, but it's something.  A girl died last night. Lexington Ave.  The news said she was alone in the apartment when she went out -- she wasn't. It's a cover-up. There was someone else.  Who lives in the apartment?  That's all I know. You asked me to tell you something. I told you something.  Jack. Let me in.  I need some sleep -- not much. I don't want to go home just yet. A little sleep first. Can I crash here? Nice place.  Can I?  What do you know about Tis? What's his relationship to Ann?  No.  Nothing.  Is he dangerous?  It was something else. Tell me if you hear anything.  Tis.       That it'd be like this -- like, your life, you... that it would turn out this way? --  -- Robert --    Got a tub?  Great.  Manny. LeTour. Jealous. \"Jell.\" SOB's.  Burning Spear.   How's product?  I got a problem. I need a piece.  A gun.  Now. Anything. Am I speaking too fast?  The rate. What you got?  How much?  You're fucking me.  Where is it?  How do you use this?  I don't have much use for a gun. Never used one like this.    -- Dios.  Have you been to the police station?  I didn't know.  (wipes tear from her cheek  Look. Do you recognize anyone?  You know him?  It's me. Cologne. I'm a sucker for that cheap airplane stuff. Did Marianne mention him yesterday?  I don't know.      I'll try.  Sorry about last night.

You're gonna do it, aren't you? You're gonna quit.  When?    -- khaki pants.  I gotta stop home a second.  You know I got a bad vibe about Tis.  I want to get my lucky jacket.  Ann, you got some mouth on you.  For you.  Do me a favor.  Don't ask why, just promise.    It's my sister. Her husband's in San Quentin. She worries, you know.  I thought we were going to Tis'?  Tis there?      Hello.  Twenty minutes. You look terrific.  Sentencing's in ten days -- supposed to be. Because of the extenuating circumstances -- our cooperation -- they say it won't be more than five years -- maybe seven. With time served, good behavior, parole, I could be out in two years -- maybe. I hope.  It's not so bad. It's a relief in a way -- at least so far. I've been writing, reading.  How's business?    Did we ever fuck?  You know, make love.  We were naked, but did we --?  I didn't --  I was thinking about it and I realized we never really did. It's one of the things I think about. It's one of the things I look forward to. I've been looking forward.",

This nineteen-gram shit is a drag.  I can't believe Ann's been working as long as she has -- never busted. She's something.  Sure.  You believe that? What you gonna do after she quits? How long you been with her?  She's out. You should pick up her trade. You're too old to be a go- fer. They know you, they trust you.  Yeah.  Tour.  Normally this wouldn't matter to you, but you may get hassled.  You read the papers? The Park murder. All over the Post. Mariah Rangel -- nineteen-year-old Barnard co-ed bitch dead in Turtle Pond coked to the fucking gills. All of a sudden they're hot after mid-level dealers. They're buzzin'. You know her?",

Downtown's interested how a Barnard honors student with fancy parents got a quarter of uncut coke on her when she was murdered. I mean, we just don't see this girl cruising Alphabet City trying to score. Somebody sold her, somebody upscale and classy -- you're classy, I hear -- and that somebody knows something we need to know. Delivery boy!  Let me put it this way. Here's my card Ask around, take a week or so. Call me. Tell me something I don't know. Either that, leave town, or get your ass busted day in, day out.",

What a coincidence.  She would be so happy to see John.  The hospital lets us stay in her room.  You go, Marianne, it's my turn with mom.  Go. You haven't eaten. Go on. Go on.  Bring me a coffee.  I'm sorry. That's the way it is. You shouldn't have come. Marianne has been up all night, crying and crying. She wasn't there when Mother passed -- died -- she blames herself. It wouldn't have made any difference. She just slipped away. Marianne's -- I'm worried --  Don't try.  Me?  Thanks. I'm okay -- I guess. I mean, we've been expecting it. It'll hit me later.  Who?  Oh. I'd better get back. Marianne's probably flipping out.          You're not to blame. Don't blame yourself. You weren't responsible. She was always -- she loved you.  She scared me.  Tis.  His father's a lawyer. Did some tax things for Mom. He was at the hospital. What's that smell?    She jumped.
