        "Carmen": "is beautiful, just 18, and quite pleased with herself  because Johnny Rico is clearly infatuated with her.   They probably wouldn't say anything. Hiroshima was destroyed.  Johnny presses Â´\"SEND\" on his desk, and the cartoon appears across the way on Carmen's screen.    walk with their friends. Several COUPLES hold hands. Johnny tries to take Carmen's hand, but she demurs. Johnny broods.   C'mon, let's see if they've posted the math final test yet.    join other students around a MULTI-SCREEN KIOSK.   First thing Fleet Academy looks at is your math scores. Wish me luck !  Carmen enters her name, receives her score:97% !She beams.   Your turn...  Then she spots Carl across the way talking with MARCO, 17.   Hold on... I wanna talk to Marco. His sister's at Fleet !  Carmen rushes off. Johnny checks his score:35% ! Crushed, he makes sure no none else has seen. Carl walks up to him.   She's flying starships !   Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical   C'mon Johnny, we'll be late for Biology.   Eeuch !   But we 're intelligent. Human minds have invented art, mathematics and interstellar travel.   Excuse me...!  She heads for the door, hand over her mouth.    walk home from school together.   Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.   Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.   I don't want everyone to see.   How come that's all you talk about anymore ?    and Johnny stand together near a bank of TRANSPORTERS.   You can't walk me home.   I thought you were going to help Carl.   Johnny, my Dad's home today.  Johnny's face darkens with frustration.   It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.   Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?  Carmen steps into the flux.ZAPPP!She's gone. Johnny grins, happy to be in love.    and other students wearing orange and black sing the \"Uni High Song\". The SCOREBOARD says:REGIONAL FINAL. Across the field, fans wear red and gold and sing another song.   Are you alright ?   Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?   You're going to the Academy ? That's where I want to go. I'd love to talk to you abou that.  A REFEREE blows his whistle at Zander, signalling impatiently.   Don't you have to finish the game ?    dance. Johnny wants to kiss her, Carmen playfully avoids.   How do I know if this is love ?   Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...   I'll meet you outside.  Johnny heads over to Rasczak.   Johnny, this is Zander.   Good luck at the academy.  Zander takes back the wings and pins the to his tunic.    walk together along the river holding hands.   He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?   No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.   Zander is going for pilot, too.   Johnny Rico, you're jealous !   He's nothing like you.   Are you the boy for me ?   Oh, Johnny...    making out as they wait their turn. There are a few other people around including a POLICEMAN.   Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...   You're right. Let's never stop...    kissing at her front door. Johnny moves his hand tenatively to Carmen 's breast. She takes his hand, smiling, puts it under her shirt.   Shhh...  She puts her mouth on his and they melt together. The door flies open, and CARMEN'S DAD stands there.   Carmen, it's late. Get inside.   Sorry, Dad. See you, Johnny.  Carmen ducks inside. Her father looks Johnny over. He carries a terrible battle scar oon his face.   I don't want you around Carmen anymore. Get me ?   Carmen's gonna be a citizen. She don't need you and your rich family. The Federation'll give her everything she needs.   Dad, leave him alone...  Carmen's Dad slams the door in Johnny's face.    meet Carl in front of the induction center where a staedy flow of prospective citizens file through the main doors.    are routed into different lines, joining other hopeful civilians. A COLONEL makes a speech over the loudspeaker.    proudly takes the Federal Service oath with about twenty-five other people, a gleaming silver FLEET PIN on her chest. She looks around for Johnny, sees him grinning at her.    walk out together happily, hand in hand.   I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?   Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.  The Recruiting Sergeant is getting ready to go home. He's got legs now, and he takes a prosthetic arm from its case and snaps it on. He grins when he sees them staring.   I'm gonna go for pilot.   Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?    are stunned.   Games &amp; Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !   Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.   I can't wait to tell my Dad I'm in. He's gonna be so happy !   My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.  At the freight station, Carmen enters her Federal I.D. card and gets numbered tags for her bags.   Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.   You talk to Carl ?   It's exciting, but it's scary, too isn't it. Going someplace new where you don't know anyone.  Carmen heads toward a bank of transporters. Johnny stops her, takes her by the arms.   I'll miss you, too, Johnny.   Oh, that's me.  She scans her pass, but Johnny stops her again.   Alright, I love you.  Carmen kisses him, jumps into the transporter.   I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !  ZAPPP !The last thing he sees are her beautiful eyes.    watches the end of Johnny's letter. Ace continues to sing.    and the bald cadet race for the hatch past other recruits.    gets there first, jumps into the pilot seat. The Bald Pilot takes second seat.    Looking it down !  Two LATE CADETS duck in through the closing hatch door.   On my mark, in three, two, one...     blasts past a DESTROYER orbiting in dock, zips between CORVETTES and other slower fleet traffic in the crowded space lanes of Luna. The two late cadets are terrified.   This is nothing. Today, I get to fly that !  She points. Now visible from behind a host of smaller ships, STARSHIP ATHENA, of older design, but impressive.    arrives on the bridge, dark, cramped, all-business. She salutes the instructor, CAPTAIN DELADIER, 40s.   Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.   Yes, ma'am !  Carmen turns for her station, but stops in her tracks. Her supervisor is Zander Barcalow, now a 2nd Lieutenant.   Hey ! What are you doing here ?   Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you \"sir\" ?   It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.   Yes, ma'am.  All eyes are on carmen as she grabs the stick. The ship shudders under her hand. She winks at Zander.   In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.   Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?   Or...?   Oh, I see... teamwork.  Carmen jogs past lumbering freighters. Zander's impressed.   Hi, Johnny, I would've written sooner, but they've really got us going every moment here.   I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.  Johnny holds up his squad leader chevrons victoriously.   Look at that. Isn't it beautiful ? I had to show you. It's great to be out here on my own. I'm just not some little girl from Buenos Aires anymore. I'm gonna be a starship pilot, and I'm gonna see the universe...  And that's also the problem because I don't really want to get married, Johnny. I don't want to have kids. I want a command, a ship of my own, and you know, I don't think that's gonna leave a lot of room for you and me.  Johnny is stunned. All the other recruits suddenly seem to have something else to do.   I know that's not what you wanted to hear... but I have to follow my heart. I'm sorry. I'm afraid you'll hate me, and I couldn't stand that. Write me, alright ? Write me, so I'll know that we'll always be friends.  The Fleet Mail logo appears again:END OF MESSAGE. Johnny shuts the handcam off. Ace puts a hand on his shoulder.    works alone on the empty bridge. She yawns. Zander brings coffee for himself and Carmen.   Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.   No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.   Hey, check it.  Zander slides into his chair, runs a check.   Don't change the subject. Am I right ?   Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?   You and me, huh ?  Zander turns his chair so they are very close, moves a finger along her hand, up her arm and playfully around her breasts.   No, what do you want ?  Zander pulls her to him and they kiss passionately. She brteaks it off, gets serious for amoment.   I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...    It looks like an... asteroid.    Zander brace themseves as diamond hard particles pound the front screens. The ship continues to tumble.   Thank you, ma'am.   HeyJohnny !Johnny Rico !  Johnny looks up and sees Carmen. She lloks graet in uniform with the hat and the lieutenant's bars on her shoulders.   Oh... at ease. Guess I oughta lose the hat when I'm off duty, eh ?  Dizzy, disgusted, turns back to Ace and Kitten Smith. Carmen tucks her hat under her arm. Her hair is very short.   What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?   It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.   You don't look very happy to see me.   Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.  Zander leaves a group of FLEET OFFICERS to join them.   Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.  Zander puts his arm around Carmen, gives her a squeeze.   Johnny, wait...   Zander, please... Let's go !  Zander takes off his hat.   What's wrong with you ?    holds Rodger Young in tight maneuver. Suddenly, a burst of BLUE BUG PLASMA rips past the starboard bow.   Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.    watches nervously as deadly bursts of bug plasma fill the heavens around the battle group. Below, the surface of Klendathu fairly bistles with outgoing defensive fire.   Ticonderoga, this is Rodger Young requesting approach vector...  TICONDEROGA C&amp;C Affirmative, Rodger Young...one zero zero niner five two... welcome back.    stare at the BATTLE-SCARED STARSHIPS and BURNT-OUT HULKS that line the docks of Ticonderoga.   You know, we're lucky to be alive.  A bloody bandage wraps Carmen's head. Zander nods grimly.   You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !   There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...   So who's got time to get married ?  Carmen lets his hand go and leaps through the hatch. Zander falls back onto the conveyer belt, finds himself eyeball-to-eyeball with a horribly maimed trooper, scrambles to get off.   Funny...   No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.   Oh no.  Tears fill her eyes.   Excuse me...!  She rushes away. Zander looks at Johnny's name on the screen, shrugs, presses the ERASE button.   Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...  Zander puts an arm around her. She holds on tight.   No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.   No, don't you see ? No one can wait for anything anymore... You're right... We should get married...  Zander holds Carmen as she sobs, feeling lucky.   Johnny...! I thought you were dead !   Rodger Young, this is inbound shuttle De Ruyter with an official request from the Mobile Infantery to bombard Planet P-11...   Negative on your request. Fleet Command has the battle group on standby...  Carmen sees Dizzy lying dead on the deck.   ...I'm sorry.   No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.  She points out for a viewing port. Johnny looks. Fifteen battle groups, 100 ships strong, lay off Planet P, all of them dwarfed by the Sky Marshall's flagship, Buenos Aires.   I thought you were KIA, Johnny...   You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.   Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.   A funeral.   Yeah.   I don't know, Zander.    enters as Johnny speaks. Dizzy is laid out in dress gray. The surviving Roughnecks have gathered to pay final respects.   Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.   You knew and you sent them anyway ?   Hope you get your Brain Bug, Carl.   Take care, wilya Johnny ?   Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?   Prepare for warp !   This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!    and Captain Deladier run for the lifepods. An explosion flips the corridor. Captain Deladier's leg is crushed when an airlock closes on her.   No way, ma'am !    pushes into the chaotic life pod bay. PANICKED CREW shoving, screaming, fighting. The ship pitches. They tumble, landing near a pod. Carmen jumps for it, pulls Deladier in after.    navigates through a graveyard of floating wreckage, dead cap troopers, someone's trombone. She sets her beacon and the pod plummets downward.   Mayday, mayday ! This is Lieutenant Carmen Ibanez in lifepod RY63... I'm going in...    is shaken violently as the pod hits atmosphere.    hits and goes straight through the crust of Planet P.   This is Lieutenant Carmen Ibanez. Is anyone receiving ?    sees a warrior coming at her from out of the shadows. Carmen fires a burst and kills it. Now there are two. Carmen backs up firing, but there are too many.   My present location is 42 degrees South by 176 degrees East... situation is extremely hostile...    opens her eyes. She can hear BUGS CLICKING. She's in a pit filled with human dead. A nearby carcass wears a uniform from 4th Brigade Off in the dark she hears HUMAN MOANING.  She crawls over rotting corpses toward the sound. The moaning turns to SCREAMING. It's coming from outside the pit. She pulls herself up to peer over the edge.    sees hundred of bugs at work, WARRIORS, WORKERS and dozens of small  CHARIOT BUGS. Aworker walks pas, stepping on her, but pays her no attention.  She sees the source of the screaming:Captain Deladier is hold between two warriors, and she's screaming because of what she sees,    Johnny...!  Zander takes this in. Carmen sees him, then his wound.   Zander...! Oh, you're hurt.  Ace takes a look at his wound, makes a face.   I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?   Is it true ?   Which way ?   Zander, what are you doing ?   Zander, no...!  He grabs her and kisses her. Johnny drags Carmen away. Zander opens fire as the first warriors reach his position.    race desperately for the surface. They hear the chatter of Zander's pulse cannon and the screams of dying bugs.    and the surviving Roughnecks make it to the surface. WOMP ! A subterrenean nuclear explosion blows a column of earth and stone into the air.   Look... they got it.  Several of its delicate legs were apparently broken during the capture. Carl approaches it without fear, puts his hand on the thing.   To the best of my understanding, i",
        "Ibanez": "is beautiful, just 18, and quite pleased with herself  because Johnny Rico is clearly infatuated with her.",
        "Carl": "Gee, we always thought you were the supreme authority, Mr. Rasczak.  Laughter. Rasczak grins.   You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.   Others are waiting.  Carl points out Dizzy, talking with friends.   Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.  It's true. You can tell by the way she looks at Johnny.   You got it bad.  Carmen returns to Johnny as Carls heads off.   Don't forget about this afternoon.  He's always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss.  Carmen blushes, covers.    is hard-wired to the stacks of processing units that comprise Carl's basement workshop. Carl concentrates on the image of a playing card, the six of diamonds, displayed on a monitor.   Don't think about it... go on instinct.   Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.   Luck is not a factor. No one really knows why some people are sensitive and some aren't. Federal studies like this might provide a clue.  The next card up is the nine of clubs.   Cyrano, you big yellow turd !  Johnny knows this frog, scratches him on the neck.   Go bug Mom, Cyrano.  Cyrano's eyes widen. He hops off the table and up the stairs two at a time. Carl clears the screen.   I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.  From upstairs, CARL'S MOM shrieks.   Don't be afraid. Can't do humans... yet. C'mon let's go.  Carl, puts up more cards, Johnny misses them all.   Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?   Your father will never let you.   Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?   If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.   Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.  Carl puts a card up.   Well, what do you know about that !   Outa the way you two !  Carl and Dizzy dance by, Dizzy smiling bravely because Carl is a terrible dancer. Johnny goes in for the kiss again.   That's us. Where do we sign ?  He turns in his chair to grab the forms. Johnny and his friends see that he is also missing both legs. The Recruiting Sergeant catches them looking, smiles even wider.    are routed into different lines, joining other hopeful civilians. A COLONEL makes a speech over the loudspeaker.   No.   I got Games &amp; Theory.  Well, everyone's a little impressed by this.   Well, we're gonna be millions of light years away from each other, and chances are we'll never see each other again, but sure...   To defeat the enemy, we must know the enemy. Take for instance your basic Arachnid warrior. Minimal IQ, armored, completely lethal. You can blow a limb off...  Carl picks up apulse gun and blows one of the bugs legs off. The insect screams.   ... and it's still 86% combat effec-tive. But here's a tip: Aim for the nerve stem and put it down for good.  Carl fires again. The bug kicks and squeals as it dies. Carl tosses the pulse gun aside.   Now while you are out killing bugs, we want you to be our eyes and ears. The bugs use some kind of plasma burst to divert meteors and aim them toward Earth. We need to know how they do this. If you encounter any plasma, report it immediately to your superior. Good luck and good hunting !  The briefing ends as klaxons sound.   This conference is over. Do your duty, Lieutenant. That's an order.  Rasczak recovers, salutes stiffly.   Please continue, Sergeant.   Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...   Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.   A colony has to reach a certain size before it produces a Brain... we think 300 generations. Woulda too expensive to launch an operation if there wasn't a Brain...  Carl sees the way Carmen is looking at him, like he's a bug.   You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.   Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.   I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?   It's good to see you two. It reminds me of the way things were before...  Carl turns abruptly and heads away. His entourage follows.   It's afraid.  Johnny and Carmen approach the General.",
        "Jenkins": "",
        "Sugar": "Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?   Good luck. It's not there anymore.   Mine, too.   You never seen how they do it before ?  Johnny shakes his head. Swollen BREEDER BUGS gather around the plasma bug to inject it with their catalytic jelly.   It's gonna pop !  WOMP ! The plasma bug explodes in its cauldron. A blast of bug plasma streaks past them towards the heavens. Now a new plasma bug crawls into the pit to begin the cycle anew.   You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?   Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.   Fire in the hole !  An explosion in the mess hall closes the bug hole.   General ! GENERAL, stay with the wounded... Sir, the general...!   Here they come !  They turn and see a second bug hole open up.   Fire in the hole !  Sugar Watkins fires an H.E. round and seals the tunnel.",
        "Watkins": "Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?   Good luck. It's not there anymore.   Mine, too.   You never seen how they do it before ?  Johnny shakes his head.

        "Jean": "",
        "Rasczak": "The end of another school year, and for me no doubt another failure... Rico, pay attention !  The teacher JEAN RASCZAK, 38, a rugged veteran who proudly displays his missing hand, scowls at Johnny, bemused.   Here in History and Moral Philosophy we've explored the decline of Democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos, and how the veterans took control and imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since... You know these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You. Why are only citizens allowed to vote ?  Rasczak points at LANNY, 17, with his stump .  No. Something given has no value ! Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ? I guess they ought to revoke my teaching credential...  Laughter. Johnny's cartoon, meanwhile, is taking shape: Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship.   When you vote, you're exercising political authority. You're using force. And force, my friends, is violence, the supreme authority from which all other authority derives.  CARL JENKINS, 18, a superintelligent geek, jumps in.   In my classroom, you bet. Whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion, political authority is violence by degree. The people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it.  DIZZY FLORES, 18, athletic, pretty, no nonsense, chimes in.   Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that. You.  Rasczak points at Carmen.   Correct. Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor. The contrary opinion 'violence never solves anything' is wishful thinking at its worst.  While Rasczak looks away, Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful smile, and Johnny's gone, checked out, flying round Venus.   People who forget that always pay... They pay with their lives and their freedom.  Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face. So does Rasczak. He points at him with his stump, snaps Johnny to.   You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?   The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?   Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.  A bell rings. Rasczak shrugs, indifferent.   Well, that's it. Have a nice life.   What is it, Rico ?    Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.   Good for you. Go find out.   Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.   This is for you new people. I only have two rules. Rule one, everyone fights. Rule two, no one quits. If you don't do your job, I'll kill you myself. Do you get me ?   Get rid of the jewelry. I hate it. Welcome to the Roughnecks.   Alright. There's a new Sky Marshall and a new plan. We're gonna clean out the systems outlying Klendathu one planet at a time. Tomorrow we hit Tango Urilla. After Fleet glasses the planet, M.I. mops up.   Spread out, teams of three. When you locate a bug hole, secure it, gas it, and close it.   Sugar, in for pick up !  Rasczak and Sugar Watkins pull Birdie to safety. Johnny fires a rocket into the hole he's made in the tanker bug's back, and jumps clear. KA-WHAP ! The big bug explodes.   Gas that hole and close it !  The Roughnecks fire gas rockets into the bug hole. Johnny touches down beside Rasczak.   Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?   I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.  Rasczak turns away, gives Birdie prosthetic thumps up as she is carried past to meet an arriving skimmer.   Don't worry, Birdie, your next arm comes with a factory guarantee !  Dizzy and Ace gather around Johnny, clap him on the back.   Saddle up, Roughnecks. That's our trash !  Roughnecks head out on the bounce.   We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?   Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !   They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?   Heat it up.  Dizzy activates a tactical nuke. It makes a distinctive HIGHPITCHED SQUEAL.   Roughnecks, you may fire at will.  The Roughnecks open fire. Bugs are blown to pieces but they keep climbing. A warrior breeches their line. Sugar Watkins torches it. The nuke's ready light flashes.     Kill the bitch.   Tango Urilla is now bug free. Means the Roughnecks have killed  a helluva lotta bugs...!  Roughnecks cheer. Rasczak kicks open a CARGO MODULE. Beer kegs rool out. He kicks open a second module. Inside, musical instruments. Ace picks up a violin.   I expect the best, but I give the best. Habve some fun. That's an order !   Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?   Never pass up a good thing, eh ?  Gillespie appears.    is in holo conference with an INTELLIGENCE OFFICER   I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.   Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...  The Intelligence Officer reddens.   My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-   Yes, sir.   Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.   Who's that with you ?  Dizzy shows herself, grinning.   Report in ten minutes.  Rasczak slams the door shut on them. They fall back into one anothers arms, laughing as they resume lovemaking.   Keep trying, Sergeant.    Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?   Throw a rifle !  Dizzy tosses her Morita to Rasczak. Gillespie writhes in the hopper's claws. Rasczak fires, killing Gillespie.   I expext any one here to do the same for me... Rico, Watkins, Flores, Levy prepare for rear guard action. The rest of you make for 4th Brigade.  Johnny and the others cover the Roughneck retreat as hoppers soar down on the flat lands from the canyon walls.       Jeez, Command really humped the bunk on this one...  Rasczak turns away. Roughnecks engage in the sport of methodically killing the workers.   Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.    enter the radio room. A DEAD MAJOR is slumped over the console with hole in the back of his head. Johnny checks the equipment. It' dead, too.   What's that look like to you, Rico ?   Gas that hole and seal it.  Then they hear a sound. Tap tap tap. Rasczak signals for quiet. Tap tap tap tap. It's coming from the kitchen.   Pick up the general !  Roughnecks prop him up. General Owen tries to talk, but no words come out. Rasczak bends down to listen.   General Owen, sir ?  The old man grins, hugely relieved.    help the old General, now wrapped in a blanket, rambling.   The distress call... The bugs wanted us to rescue you...!   To all Roughnecks, this is Rasczak. Prepare for attack. Repeat. We are going to be attacked...!   Shut up ! Your soldier's dead and you're not !   I oughta !  And it looks like Rasczak just might, but just then Ace touches down next to Johnny and Rasczak.    and Johnny join other stunned Roughnecks to see THOUSANDS OF BUGS on the march from every direction. Bug batteries open up in the distance.   Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?   Ah, the hell with him...  Hoppers sweep into the compound. The Roughnecks open fire. General Owen make easy pickings for ones that get through.   Fall back... form a circle ! If no living bug comes over that wall, we cannot be harmed.  Dizzy arrives on thr bounce as the Roughnecks fall back into the compound. Bugs pile in over the walls. The circle affords them 360 degrees of kill zone.   Rico, Flores, Watkins, Levy ! We control the sky until retrieval !   Make every shot count !  Johnny looks up. A RETRIEVAL BOAT hurtles down through bursts of bug plasma, takes a grazing hit, rights itself with retros and lands within the circle. Roughnecks cheer, saved !   Sergeant, secure the boat !   Board the wounded !  Dead bugs ring the compound walls, forming ramps for living insect soldiers to enter the compound in greater numbers.   Move to retrieval on my command ! First group, now...!  The circle shrinks as Roughnecks fall back and board the boat. More and more bugs pile in over the compound walls.   Alright, Flores ! Levy ! Rico...!  Suddenly, the ground collapses under Rasczak. He falls in to his waist, vomits blood as something chews on him from below.    I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...  The compund wall collapses. A wave of bugs charges in.   Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...   This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.   C'mon you sons of bitches ! There's no bug alive can kill a real mAAAAAAA !  At the boat, Dizzy turns to look back at Rasczak. A hopper swoops down on Dizzy, it's claws ripping into her abdomen.",

        "Zander": "Time's running out.  Zander points. The SCOREBOARD showsTIGERS 19,GIANTS 20, three minutes and counting on the clock. Johnny grins.    looks up and sees Carmen, smiling as she offers him a hand. She helps him up. He holds her hand longer than necessary.   I'm getting better.    finds his shoe, straps it on.   So what are you doing later ?   I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.  Zander heads for the field. Carmen follows, interested.   I'm all ears.   You can never be sure.  Johnny scowls at Zander, turns his head to look back at Carmen. She waves, smiling. The Giants pull ablitz.   Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?   Always.   I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.  Carmen logs on. The ship recognizes her as a pilot trainee.   Only when I give you an order.   Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...   This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.   Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.  Carmen rocks the stick, and the view from the bridge spins smoothly away from the dense orbiting yards os Luna toward the outer system.   They revoke our flight status.   Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...  Space appears to bend. Zander and Carmen share a smile. They blur together, becoming one, then:WHAM !   Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.  He caresses her hair. She kisses his hand. Zander notices the plot map.   Profile's wrong... there.   Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?   You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...   Well, whad'ya know...   She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.   I have a feeling about us. We're good together, way ahead of the curve in every department. I seem to be able to anticipate your needs. You know what I want...  Carmen grabs him between his legs.   Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.  They start to caress again when suddenly ALARMS sound. Captain Deladier appears on the hot screen, still waking up.   Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...  Carmen and Zander frantically check their displays.    Sweet Jesus...!  Carmen breaks glass that reads EMERGENCY RETROS, arms the switch within and fires the rockets.   Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.   Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?   Best in the Fleet !   Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.  Johnny turns back to face Zander.   You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?   Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.   It's alright. What's he gonna do ?  WHAM !Johnny punches him right in the nose. Zander goes down, bleeding. Ace and Kitten Smith grab Johnny.   Drop is 35% complete, ma'am.  Two more bursts of bug plasma streak past.   That's it, we're empty ma'am !  Out the front screens, a blast from below hits George Marshall amidships and it reels into Yamamoto. Both starships begin to burn.    Give me hand, willya ?  Carmen takes his hand. Zander kisses her.   I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.   If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?   So ?    joins Carmen in the crowded common area where dead bodies compete for space with wounded awaiting triage. Survivors watch casualty lists scroll ba on a Federal Net terminal.   Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.   I'm not kidding. Marriage is -   Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.  Carmen looks at the words at the Net terminal: WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE ? She bites her lip, enters Johnny's name. In an instant, she has the news:  Carmen...?    finds Carmen, sagging against a wall, weepimg.   I'm sorry, Carmen.   You're upset, that's alright.  Zander kisses her hair. Tears roll down her face.   On whose authority, Corporal ?    enters, watches Carmen dress. She hums as she checks herself in the mirror, touches thr scar over her eye, smiles.   Where are you going ?   That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?   How do you feel about him now ?   I do.   This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?   Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.   The Rodger Young just burned up...  Johnny's face falls.   You know as well as I do she's probably already dead.  Johnny knows it's true, swallows bitterly, turns away. That's when he sees it. Nearby, the ground shifts, a claw breaks through, a hole opens up and bugs boil up out of the ground.   Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-  The entire area underneath the base camp collapses to form a huge new canyon. The Hercules boat topples, crushing Skimmers and unfortunate Fleet personnnel.    Thanks.   What do you think you're doing ?   That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.   Let's go.     Not a problem.   It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...   Been better, buddy.  Johnny sees warriors coming up into the tunnel by the score.   Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.  Zander checks his pulse cannon's available power.   This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...  Johnny nods, hands him the nuke. Carmen sees what's happening.   Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.",
        "Barcalow": "",
        "Katrina": "I'll bet he makes squad leader.   Improper Attitude ! They'll kick you out for talking like that...   I wanna be a mom. It's easier to get a licence if you've served.   Hey, what's going on ?   Hi, Carmen !  Johnny heads for the door.   Goddam bugs whacked us, Johnny.   Let's get out of here !  Now the ground opens behind her and a huge  TANKER BUG lumbers out of the ground, it's funnel-shaped snout extruding above multiple eyes.",
        "Breckinridge": "Sir, I guess maybe I do, sir.  Zim crooks afinger at him. Breckinridge charges. Zim knocks him flat. Breckinridge holds his arm, twisted now.   Sir, yes, sir. It's my arm. I think it's broken, sir.   Come on, Ace, back off the line ! Bacl off the line !  Now everyone's laughing, pushing Ace to the back of the line. Johnny has his grub. Dizzy comes up with her tray.   Well, my family is all farmers. I hate farming. Mobile Infantery's pure picnic by comparison.   Don't look that way to me.  Everyone look down at Johnny's crotch, laughing. Johnny blushes, grabs a towel and exits the shower.   Dunno. Display's fritzed.",
        "Johnny": "Com'on, let's go !ON THE BOUNCE  The cap troopers move out, among them DIZZY FLORES, 18, ACE LEVY, 19, and KITTEN SMITH, 18. The CAMERA pauses, unsure.      Oh, God... Oh, God, help me... please help me...  His eyes glaze over as he remembers   Sorry, Mr. Rasczak.  But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class, Johnny begins to sketch a cartoon on his desk's touch screen.   The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.   Uh, I don't know.    walk with their friends. Several COUPLES hold hands. Johnny tries to take Carmen's hand, but she demurs. Johnny broods.   How should I know ?    join other students around a MULTI-SCREEN KIOSK.   Good for you.   What's the hurry ?   Did you read her mind ?   Yeah, but I want Carmen.   Who ?   I have good reflexes.  Carmen notices the way Dizzy's looking at Johnny, doesn't like it one bit, takes Johnny's arm.   Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.   Better put your goggles on.  Johnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser. Green fluid sprays from the slit. Carmen turns away looking ill.   Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...    walk home from school together.   35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.   Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.   Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?   Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?   It's all I think about anymore.  Indeed, they are all alone now. The look in Johnny's eye says how about it. Carmen grins, reaches for Johnny's hand.   Why not ?   Carl can wait.   What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !   Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?    is hard-wired to the stacks of processing units that comprise Carl's basement workshop. Carl concentrates on the image of a playing card, the six of diamonds, displayed on a monitor.   Ace of spades.  The ace of spades appears, and the computer indicates \"no match\". Carl puts another card up, the jack of diamonds.   In addition to \"psychic dolt\" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.  Wrong again.   I wouldn't want to know what everyone was thinking. Four of spades.  Suddenly, A GIANT YELLOW FROG jumps onto the keyboard, fritzing the monitor. Johnny removes the blindfold.   He just wants attention. You don't play with him like you used to.  Carl concentrates for a moment.   How do you make him do that ?   Carl, promise me you won't ever do anything like that to me.   Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&amp;D ?   I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.   I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.   Eight point... no, uh, seven...   All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.   Queen of hearts.  The computer indicates a match. Johnny peers around at the monitor. It is the Queen of hearts.    and other UNI HIGH TIGERS, all exceptionally robust young man and women, suit up in their orange and black uniforms.   We tumble good, too.    and other Tigers listen as quarterback Dizzy calls the plays.   A lot can happen in three minutes.    runs back to join his team as the crowd cheers. The Tigers lead 21-20. Johnny frowns when he sees Carmen talking to Zander on the sidelines, shaking his head, smiling.   Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.   What ?   Just throw me the ball, Diz.  They make fists and break.    takes position again across the line from Zander who now grins at Johnny broadly. Johnny  doesn't grin back.    walks throuh rooms filled with elegant furniture. He's all spiffed up for the big dance. His MOTHER catches him preening in front of a mirror by the TRANSPORTER in the hall.   Aw, don't get mushy.  Johnny's FATHER enters carrying a FEDERAL SERVICE CATALOGUE.   A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...   It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.   Mr. Rasczak.   No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.   I'm eighteen. It's my decision.   Uh, no.   Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.   Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !   I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !   Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !  Johnny stomps out, the transporter goes ZAPPP !   Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...   You still gonna play for Brazil ?   Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.   Can't we just be friends, Diz ?   Uh, look, Diz...   You're the best.  Johnny heads for Carmen. Dizzy watches jealously as Carmen takes his hand. She looks around for someone to dance with. Carl, a nerd in a tux, waves shyly.    dance. Johnny wants to kiss her, Carmen playfully avoids.   Isn't it great to be in love ?   It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...   Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.  Johnny's confidence makes her smile. Johnny moves in to kiss her, but the music ends. Everyone applauds. The lights come up and people head for the doors. Johnny sees Rasczak.   Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.   Mister Rasczak ?   I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.   I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.   Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?    walks out and finds Carmen talking with Zander. He wears the blue uniform of a Fleet pilot trainee. Carmen examines his FLEET PIN, a pair of silver wings.   None at all... We won.    walk together along the river holding hands.   Yeah, sure, I guess.   What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.   You two have so much in common.  Carmen pulls Johnny to a stop, looks him in the eye.   I can't help it.   I don't even know if you're my girl.  Carmen smiles, leans in close to Johnny.   I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.  They kiss, tentatively, but the passion grows and they break apart, breathless.    making out as they wait their turn. There are a few other people around including a POLICEMAN.   Who cares ?    kissing at her front door. Johnny moves his hand tenatively to Carmen 's breast. She takes his hand, smiling, puts it under her shirt.   I love you, Carmen.   Maybe Carmen's gonna make her own decisions from now on, Mr. Ibanez.  Carmen's Dad reddens. He'd like to punch Johnny out.   meet Carl in front of the induction center where a staedy flow of prospective citizens file through the main doors.    are routed into different lines, joining other hopeful civilians. A COLONEL makes a speech over the loudspeaker.    and others in the line strip down. The guy in front of Johnny is DON, 18, athletic and cheerful.    grimaces as a TECHNICIAN installs an INTERFACE PLATE on his side, drawing fluids.   Here in Buenos Aires.  The Psych Officer checks Johnny's response on a meter.    is poked and prodded, subjected to aural, visual and pharmacological stimuli, and scanned from head to toe.   No, sir.   Courage, I guess.   I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.    sits across from a MAJOR who views a list on a monitor Johnny can't see.   Wow, that's great.   I want to be a pilot, sir.   ...of my own free will, without promise, coercion, or inducement, after having been duly advised and warned of the meaning and consequence of this oath, do now enroll in the Federal Service of the Terran Federation for not less than two years and as much longer as may be required by the needs of the Service...    walk out together happily, hand in hand.   Naw, I made it, Carl made it.  Just then, Don rushes past, shamefaced, crying.   He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...   Did you get Starside R&amp;D ?    are stunned.   I don't believe it !   Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !   Infantery, sir.  The Recruiting Sergeant beams, offers a prosthetic hand.   I'll go for that.   My father's probably gonna kill me.    stands sullenly as his Father rages at him.   I won't quit !   I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.  Johnny turns for the door. His father throws his last shot.    walks out, grim, sees his mother, tears in her eyes.   Well, yeah, sure...   Don't talk about my girl that way.  Johnny turns on his heel, heads for the transporter.ZAPPP !    looks for Carmen among hundreds of young people bound for Federal Service destinations. Recruits wear civilian clothes. Everyone else is in uniform.   You're late.   Me, too. I'm wearing everything I own.  Johnny loads them onto a conveyor belt.   Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?  Carmen's already moved to the next line. Johnny follows.   He left this morning. He couldn't say where.  Carmen logs in, enters her destination:LUNA - TERESHKOVA FLEET ACADEMY.The tickets station spits out a pass.   I'm gonna miss you.   I love you.   Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.   Do you mean it ?   Sir, yes, sir !  Zim points at the little WHITE PICKET FENCE leading to a transporter near the front gate.   Sir, yes, sir !   He's good alright.   Better get in line like everyone else, Ace.  Silence. There could be a fight. Zim, standing nearby, watches with interest. Ace opens his hand.   What an honor...   No thanks, Diz.   You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.   You saying you didn't ?  Johnny turns away. Dizzy watches him go, hurt.   Something... I've got...you don't.   It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!  They come to a trap, prepare to leap.   Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.   Well, maybe you better look again.   Aw, who asked you to be so nosey ?    pans the barracks with a little handcam, neat bunks in a row, other recruits lounging around in their skivvies.   I know it's not much, but it's home. Over there's my bunk where I dream about you every night...  Ace, Kitten Smith, Shujumi and Breckinridge dance around and moon the camera.   Hey, do you mind ?  Johnny moves the camera away from the guys. Katrina walks by from the shower with Dizzy, mugs into frame.    talk quietly now outside the barracks door.   Boot's pretty tough, and sometimes I think I won't make it, but then I imagine you're watching me, and that gives me someting... I try harder. Thanks to you, I think I might have a shot at squad leader.  The barracks lights go out. Taps plays over the public address. Johnny lowers his voice.   Uh-oh, I gotta pack it in. I hope you're having fun, hope you're careful. No training accidents for you, eh ?  I want to kiss you so badly. I want to feel you next to me, I-  Behind him , someone begins to sing , badly.   Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !  The letter ends. Carmen smiles. A BALD CADET PILOT smacks her on the arm as she runs by in a sleek blue pressure suit.   Man, they're defended... no way in.   What ?   Cover me.   Thanks, pal.   Sir, thank you, sir !   YEEEE-Haaaaaaaaaaaaa...!  Next in line, Ace scowls.   I just want you guys to know that I'll never do anything that I haven't asked you to do first.  Johnny approaches Dizzy.   Couldn't've done it without you, Diz. Friends ?  Dizzy smiles, shakes.   Bet it's from my girl.  Johnny's pals gather for a look. Carmen appears, dressed down to skivvies, in her quarters aboard starship Athena.   Shhhh...!   All it takes is the love of a good woman...  The image changes abrupltly. Now Carmen's wearing a trim blue flight suit. She stands the camera on Athena's gunnery deck. Outside , the rings of Saturn sparkle in bright solar light.   It's what I deserve.   I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.   Thanks, Ace.  Johnny turns for the door, flipping the chevrons like a coin. Dizzy watches him leave. She'd so like to comfort him.   Sir, yes, sir !  On a signal from Zim, the Live Fire Combat Range comes to life as the target drones take cover and disappear from view.    Alright, no more screw ups. Ace takes point. Diz, you and Kitten Smith cover the flanks. Djana'd, you're rear guard. Move out.  The squad resumes ist advance. Breckinridge bangs on his helmet. There is something wrong with his \"head up\" display.   What's the problem ?   Let me see.  Breckinridge takes off helmet, hands it to Johnny. Djana'd turns on Breckinridge. Her \"head up\" zeroes him.   Oh, God... uh... MEDIC !  Zim arrives with Bronski on the bounce.    stands before the C.O. braced by Katrina and Ace. Zim and the C.O.  are both saddened by the proceedings.   Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.   Sir, no, sir.   Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.   Sir, no, sir !   Sir... I guess I do, sir.  Zim looks out the window. Djana'd, dressed for travel, in civilian clothes, crying as she heads off down Washout Lane.    looks out the window to the parade ground where a POST has been erected. The recruits look up as Zim enters.    wears his civilian clothes, pcks as the other recruits get ready for the day's training. No one says anything. He moves stiffly, careful of his back.   I don't stay where I'm not wanted.   Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.  Corporal Bronski leans in, impassive.   Hi, mom.   It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.   I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...   Well, see ya.   What's that, Diz ?    signs form 1240/A. Zim stands as witness.    walks alone, sad. A skimmer hums by overhead and he looks after it. Out across the parade ground he sees the glint of Marauder power suits as recruits tumble the obstacle course.    reaches the little white fence that leads to the transporter. He turns back for one last look and notices people running to the Comminications shack. Kitten Smith runs by.   Hey, Kitten, what's going on ?    joins others to see what's on the Federal Net. Recruits, non-coms, and officers gatherwithout any sense of military decorum. People cry openly, among them Corporal Bronski.   Oh, jeez, is that Geneva ?   Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.   Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir.  Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.  Zim picks up Johnny's 1240/A off the C.O.'s desk.   Sir, yes it is, sir.   Yeah, well, I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill'em all !    and his friends drink at a crowded bar. Around the room there's singing and dancing, a mad sort of revelry bred of fear and excitement, but nearby a VETERAN drinks alone.   How can you tell ?   Waht's it like... combat ?   What do I want with a scar ?   Carmen... ?  Johnny remembers himself, snaps to attention, salutes. Dizzy and the others follow suit. Carmen salutes back, sheepish.   What happened to your hair ?   It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?  Carmen shakes her head, sadly.   I try just to be happy I'm still alive.   Should I be ?   I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?  Johnny turns to leave.   You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?   Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.  Everyone can see what's about to happen. A circle is forming, Fleet on one side, Mobile Infantery on the other.   Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.  Carmen turns away, stung. Johnny immediately regrets. Dizzy, for her part, couldn't be happier.    grinds his teeth as a laser mounted on a robot arm finishes slicing an intricate pattern into his arm.   It hurts...!  Dizzy, Ace, and Kitten Smith awtch, grinning, passing a bottle. Ace pours booze directly into the fresh wound.    Death to all bugs !    and his platoon, wearing fully armed MARAUDER POWER SUITS, wait to drop with other cap troopers. Their mood is grim. LIEUTENANT WILLY, 35, easy-going and confident, enters.    gets the shakes as the capsule bumps and booms toward the firing tube. Lt. Willy appears on the \"head up\" display.   Yes, sir !    takes in ENTRY DATA from the heads up display.    looks down as he passes out of the clouds and sees the battlefield. Plasma blasts exploode into the sky. THOUSANDS OF BUGS boil out of the ground to defend against the invader.    of bug batteries, screaming voices on the com, concussions shaking the ground. None of it compares to the sound of his own racing HEARTBEAT. Lieutenant Willy shouts.   Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?   Don't waste your ammon on the workers !  Shujumi can't hear. A warrior finds him, rips his leg off, hurls him back into the waiting jaws of the oncoming bugs.   C'mon, Katrina was right. We gotta get out of here !    and the other survivors on the bounce. The entire surface of Klendathu seems to be churning with insects as more and more bugs come to the surface to repel the invasion.   It's a general retreat ! The boats are coming down.  They come to the rear lines where the Net Correspondent and his CAMERAMAN are doing live coverage of the invasion.   C'mon, let's go ! ON THE BOUNCE !  The cap troopers move out. Kitten Smith looks up as a purple beacon  streaks acroos thr sky.     Medic... MEDIC...!  Now two more Arachnid warriors close in on him through the enveloping smoke. He fires his pulse rifle empty, and dropping it, crawls desperately, dragging his useless leg.   Oh, God... Oh, God, help me... please help me...!  A third Arachnid warrior rears up in front of him, deadly jaws slashing down toward him, when suddenly it is blown to pieces in the blinding blast of a point-blank pulse cannon.    floats, suspended in fluid, mouth hanging open, his skin white as death. A low underwater KNOCKING wakes him. He opens his eyes and sees Ace and Dizzy outside the tank.  Ace holds up a KIA list, pointing at Johnny's name, laughing: Rico, John V - KIA. Their voices are distant and garbled. Dizzy cups her hands against the side of the tank.    stows his gear along with Ace and Dizzy. Acroos the room, a collection of battle-hardened vets check out the newcomers.   He was our teacher... He was great.   Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?   I wouldn't mind.  CORPORAL BIRDIE, 24, turns, gives Johnny the once over.   I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.   We get you, sir !  He points at Johnny's earring with his steel hand.   Fire in the hole !  Johnny drops an H.E. round, and they're in the air when the explosion collapses the entrance to the bug city.   Looks like you've got a little bug problem, ma'am...    Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.   I'm gonna need a squad leader.   What about it, Diz ?    and the others look down a sheer cliff on the bug battery, a charred circular pit some ten meters across. Inside, something is moving.   What kind of stinkin' bug is that ?  Johnny jumps the magnification on his \"head up\". Down in the pit, a giant translucent PLASMA BUG rears out of one of the subterranean tunnels that ring the battery.   What's that ?   He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.   Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.  Johnny joins Rasczak, Ace and Dizzy and they blow away several warriors guarding the entrance of a large chamber.   All dead except one, sir.   Yes, sir.  Johnny signals. Dizzy's pulse cannon rips open the dying queen. Thousands of wriggling premature bugs come spilling out. Horrified, knee-deep Roughnecks set them afire.   Nah, I don't do that anymore...   I said no. Want me to pull rank ?   Yes, sir...   Hey, Diz...   May I have the honor ?  He pulls her out among the others and they begin to dance. Ace watches with a grin, puts some spirit in his fiddle.    are making love. The door pops open. Rasczak stands there. Dizzy ducks under the covers. Johnny manages a salute.   Yes, sir !   They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.    Yes, sir.    surveys the aftermath of the last stand with Rasczak, insect and human dead everywhere.    enter the radio room. A DEAD MAJOR is slumped over the console with hole in the back of his head. Johnny checks the equipment. It' dead, too.   Diz, see what you can do.   Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.    help the old General, now wrapped in a blanket, rambling.   Diz, what's with the uplink ?  Dizzy lokks up from where she is working on the radio controls.   What's going on, Diz ?   We don't have a minute !   All bands.   SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !   Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !   Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !  Johnny races out the door.   Boat coming down, sir !  The Roughnecks stop firing as they run out of nukes.   Not enough, I guess.  Sugar Watkins sees Genera Owen in the compound below, stumbling aimlessly among his dead soldiers.   Yes, sir !  Rasczak, Sugar Watkins, Johnny and Dizzy stand back-to-back in the center of the circle, sweeping the skies with the heavy guns from the towers. Hoppers are blown to pieces.   Yes, sir !  Roughnecks move to protect the boat. The hatch blows open.   Cover us, Ace !  Ace and the others fire from the boat. Johnny and Dizzy fire at the ground around Rasczak. Rasczak stops screaming. They try to pull him free.   Hit your jets, sir !   We're not leaving you here, sir !  Weakly, Rasczak picks up his pulse gun, checks the power.   Give'em hell, sir !  Johnny and Dizzy run for the boat. Rasczak opens fire, picking his shots, but soon the bugs are all over him.   Hang on, Diz... don't die on me...  A TANKER BUG breaches the broken wall. Ace jumps out to help his friends. The hatch closes just as the tanker bug sprays. The boat blasts off, dripping metal.    holds Dizzy in his arms, drenched in her blood, fighting G-forces as the boats heads for orbit.   No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !    slams into the cockpit. Out the front screen, violent bursts of BUG PLASMA fill the sky as they break atmosphere.   Get on the com and tell Fleet to glass that rock...!  The co-pilot turns around. It's Zander. His eyes narrow.   This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.  The pilot turns around. It's Carmen.   I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !  Johnny leaves. Carmen punches up Fleet Command.    returns to Dizzy's side as the medics struggle to save her. Blood pours out of her mouth. Her body thrashes.     We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.   That was just a mix up.   What happened to your eye ?  Carmen touches the scar over her eye.   I like it. It's kinda...you.   Dizzy bought the farm. She was my good friend, and friens are the best luck anyone gets... But in war, we must go on without our friends. We take with us their memory, and we are left to wonder if there is meaning in their death. Let me tell you what it is: Dizzy bough the farm so we can keep on fighting.  Several INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS march into the bay.   Officer on deck !  Everyone snaps to attention. Colonel Carl Jenkins strides into the room. His eyes are hollow, and he looks grim. He returns Johnny's salute, nods to Carmen.   Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.  Johnny nods to the GUNNERY CREW. They load Dizzy's body into a tube. Johnny steps back, salutes Dizzy. Everyone salutes.   Womb to tomb, cap trooper !   How are you, Carl ?   Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?   Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.  Carl allows himself a tiny smile.   The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.   I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.  KLAXONS sound. Suddenly, everyone has someplace to go.   See you on the bounce !  153INTRODGER YOUNG - COMMAND &amp; CONTROL - CARMEN  steps onto the bridge. There's a new NUMBER 2 sitting in Zander's chair. She's right out of Tereshkova, and she looks scared. Carmen turns to Captain Deladier.   I only have two rules. Rule one, everyone fights. Rule two, no one quits. If you don't do your job, I'll kill you myself. Do you get me ?    Who're all these kids ?   We're the old men, Ace.   We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.   Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...  Roughnecks boo.   Alright, cut it out. We will deploy from skimmers in teams of six. If the bugs open up a battery, we put it out of business. Any questions ?  A HERCULES CARGO BOAT hurtles out of the sky and lands on the high ground Johnny has intended forb his H.Q. Johnny scowls, marches over to the boat and confronts a FLEET OFFICER.   Would'ya mind moving your boat ?   You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !   You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down -  Suddenly, in the distance, bug batteries open fire, not one but twenty. Zander and Johnny share a look of concern.   Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !   What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?   Any survivors ?  Zander points. Far in the distance, a glowing pod plummets toward the planet. Johnny tracks it on his \"head up\".    grabs the handset from Ace.   Affirmative ! Carmen, this is Roughneck base camp... What is your present location ?    and Zander are horrified by what they hear.   We've gotta go get her !   We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.    and the surviving Roughnecks pick themselves up. The are now 30 meters below the planet's surface. Above them, bugs line the wide rim of the newly formed canyon.   Form a perimeter !  Through the dust, exposed bug tunnels can be seen in the canyon walls and piling out of them by the score, deadly Arachnid warriors. Johnny throws Zander a pulse cannon.   Make yourself useful, fly boy...  Ace, get on the com. Tell Fleet we need retrieval... Sugar, salvage some armor and suit up Lieutenant Barcalow.  Sugar Watkins tosses a bloody jump boot his way.   Looks like they're gonna hose us down...  Johnny chews on this.   Alright... Listen up, Roughnecks. We're gonna head west down through bug city, pick up any Rodger Young survivors we run across, and join A Company. Get me ?   I'm gonna save Carmen.   Yeah, that's right.  Johnny and Zander stare each other down.   Move out.  Johnny starts for the gaping mouth of an exposed bug tunnel and the others fall in behind him.    leads his deadly force through enemy territory. The Roughnecks kill everything that gets in their way. Zander lends his inexperienced hand.   Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...   Sugar, close the tunnel...!   You know what this is...?  Johnny makes an explosive sound. The Brain Bug slowly withdraws its palp.   Sure you do... You're a big fat smart bug, aren't you ?  Johnny moves toward Carmen. The Brain Bug's multiple eyes track him. The warriors holding Carmen threaten. Johnny turns on the brain bug, his finger on the nuke's trigger.   I'll take you with me.  The Brain Bug clicks. The warriors back off. Carmen collapses. Johnny reaches for her.   Take my hand !  Chariot bugs move the Brain Bug down a hole. Workers seal the hole behind it with amazing speed. Johnny drags Carmen back toward the tunnel he entered from. The warriors charge.   Roughnecks...NOW !  Johnny throws himself on top of Carmen as the Roughnecks burst into the chamber, guns blazing. The fight is furious, point blank, deadly to bug and Roughneck alike.  Sugar Watkins screams as a warrior rips his arm off. Zander takes a claw through the gut.   Weapon !  Ace throws him a Morita. Johnny catches it, pumps three rounds into the bug's nerve stem. He struggles out from under the dead warrior. Every bug in the chamber is dead.   Are you hurt ?  Carmen throws her arms around Johnny.   Can you walk ?   Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !  Various components are gladly passed forward. Johnny and Ace help her putting it on.   Yeah, if I live through this, they'll probably hang me. Now com'on, let's move out !   Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.  The tunnel floor drops out. FIVE ROUGHNECKS disappear into the hole. WARRIORS climb up into the tunnel.    How bad are you, pal ?   Alright, we're gonna carry you...   Don't be a hero...    race desperately for the surface. They hear the chatter of Zander's pulse cannon and the screams of dying bugs.     and the surviving Roughnecks make it to the surface. WOMP ! A subterrenean nuclear explosion blows a column of earth and stone into the air.    and the others enter A Company's perimeter. No one notices their arrival because everyone's gathered in a big circle watching the Brain Bug.   Sir, I'd like to turn myself in. Dereliction of duty by an officer during wartime.   Yes, sir.",

        "Shujimi": "",
        "Dizzy": "My mother always says that violence never solves anything.   Tesla's tough. They tumble good and they hit HARD.  Dizzy bounces a JUMP SHOE to Johnny. The spring fires and vaults it high into the air. Johnny catches it, puts it on, smiles cocky at the TESLA GIANTS who suit up in red and gold.   Kick three, fade left. On two.  They make fists, then breal for thevline of scrimmage.   Hut... hut !  Johnny takes the handoff, flips over a gauntlet of Giant guards. Zander hurls himself at Johnny, misses. Johnny scores. Zander tumbles into the crowd, loses a jump shoe.     orders up the next play. Johnny keeps looking over his shoulder because Zander's back talking to Carmen again.   Flip six, three hole. Rico ? Hey !  Dizzy slams Johnny upside his helmet with her forearm.   You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?   Hut !  At the snap, Johnny breaks for open field. Dizzy throws, Johnny catches it, trips Zander up painfully, and hurls himself into the end zone as a horn sounds the game's finish.   Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?   Too bad for her if she's not around.  Dizzy pulls him onto the floor, holds him close.   You know, it's sad... Most of us probably won't see each other again after tonight.  There is an invitation here. Johnny doesn't take it.   Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.   How come we never got together ?  Dizzy looks at Johnny meaningfully. He's distracted. Carmen crosses the room, stunning in her formal.   Sure.   Guess you gotta go.   Sir, recruit Flores, reporting for duty , sir.  She snaps Zim a salute and hands him her orders.   Sir, I heard it was the best, sir !   Hey, amigo, come chow with me.   What's your malfunction, Rico ?   What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?   Coming through !  Dizzy jumps over them from behind. Johnny and Ace tumble into the mud. They watch, chagrined, as Dizzy reaches the end of the course effortlessly.    enters as the recruits scrub down.   Well, some say he turned his back on the family fortune to be a citizen, others say he did it for a girl... missed a spot there, bucko... which is funny because Johnny says I joined up to be with him, but why would I do that ? He doesn't even like me.   I bet it's that girl I was talking about... Her name's Carmen, I think.   Flip six, three hole.   High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...  Johnny looks at the course in a new way, nods.   You got it.  Johnny tumbles open ground, vaults into the air. Dizzy takes out Breckinridge as he rises to fire. Johnny lands, knocks out Katrina, then Ace. He picks up Ace's fallen Morita.   Yeah, sure... friends.  Bronski walks through with the mail.   It stinks, you goin.   If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.   You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.   That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !  Dizzy turns on her heel and marches away.   Aw, Johnny, geez... It's home.   Yum, yum yum ...!   I like the jewelry. Hey, amigo, where can I get an earring like yours ?   What, your skin's too pretty ? C'mon, everyone's doing it !   Forget it, Johnny. Cap Troopers and Fleet weren't meant to mix !   Don't get any on you !   Ace, what're we doing ?   Look out !  The tanker bug sprays and hits Katrina. She screams, as her legs melt out from under her.   Johnny !JOHNNY !WHERE ARE YOU ? JOHNNY !Johnny...!  But Dizzy can't find Johnny, and soon she's lost in the smoke. Johnny looks down at the terrible hole in his leg where bright arterial blood gushes.   Two more days.  Johnny's wounds are now mostly scars except for his leg where delicate robotic arms culture layers of new tissue. Johnny gives a weak thumbs up. The knocking sound continues.  Johnny turns. A STEEL HAND taps the side of the tank. Johnny grins, astonished. The man wearing it is his former high school teacher, now a Lieutenant, Jean Rasczak.   The Roughnecks killed more bugs than any other outfit in 2nd Brigade... Only took 15% casualties on Big K.  They size up the Roughnecks. There are scars, power prosthetics, and one, big SUGAR WATKINS, 26, wears a bug claw on a chain around his neck.   Where you been besides Big K ?   We get you, sir !  He points at Johnny's earring with his steel hand.   Way to go, amigo !    Looks like I'm your girl, sir.  Tac Fighters reel by over head. WOMP ! Suddenly, BUG PLASMA shoots skyward from the flatlands below. Several Tac Fighters are blown out of the air. Flaming debris rains down.   That'd be me, sir.   I'm hot, sir !   C'mon...   You used to dance...   Well, excuse me, sir...  Dizzy heads back to the others. Johnny turns and finds Rasczak regarding him with an odd, sad smile.   What ?  Johnny takes her hand, bows implishly.    are making love. The door pops open. Rasczak stands there. Dizzy ducks under the covers. Johnny manages a salute.   Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?   Johnny, watch out !  A burning bug hurls itself at Johnny. Johnny jumps out of the way as Dizzy fires, blowing it apart. The deadly hoppers seem to be everywhere above them in the rocks.   It's here, sir.   I'm on it !  Dizzy goes to work. Rasczak checks the wound in the back of the dead major's head.   Workin on it...!   I got power ! Gimme a minute !  Johnny runs for the communications room.    has the board up. Outside the battle has begun. Nukes go WOMP ! and pulse guns chatter.   What frequency ?   Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...   300 rounds and counting, sir !    I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?   It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...  MEDICS push Johnny aside, go to work on Dizzy.",

        "Ace": "He'll have to get past me.  The recruits check Ace out. Zim sweeps Shujumi's legs, puts a knee in the little man's throat. Shujumi passes out.   Sir, I don't understands who needs a knife in a nuke fight anyway... All you gotta do is push a button, sir !  Zim yanks the knife out of the post.    I'd like to disable Zim...!   Aw, you either got what it takes or you don't.   At ease, soldier. It's all the same muck.   You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.   Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !  Ace makes a big friendly show of trading places with Johnny.   What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?   You rich kids... are all the same !   I'm going career... officer's training. That's why I wanna be squad leader. They look for that.   Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.   Carmen ! Ooh la la, Carmencita !   Hey, where you going ? Come back...! He's getting awy... Grab him...!  The picture goes all screwy, comes up again on:   I love you truly, so truly, dear...!  Ace, the singer, and the other guys peer down from the transom over the door, giggling, delighted with themselves.   Our love will grow, dear, year by year...   Zim hadda choose someone to be his brown nose, I guess.   Yeow, Rico, you don't deserve that !   Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.   Whad'ya talkin  about ?   You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.  Johnny smiles in spite of himself.   Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole, lotta dead bugs, am I right ?   Great scars.   I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.   Whoa, easy there, buddy... Nice punch.  Zander staggers to his feet, ready to fight, but Fleet Officers pull him back. Carmen looks at Johnny, the hate in his eye, the blood on his fist.   No, this hurts.   Mobile Infantery rules !    of every class maneuver in tight orbit around the orange planet. The \"Mobile Infantery Anthem\" plays loke Holst, pounding and relentless. The invasion has begun !   Officer on deck !  Everyone snaps to attention.    stream toward Klendathu from the rear tubes starships of Bull Run. We move down the line past Mannerheim, Dauntless, George Marshall, and Yamamoto to the Rodger Young.    I didn't see him !  Now comes a flood of WORKERS building ever advancing fortifications, and with them, hundreds of deadly ARACHNID WARRIORS.   I uh... uh...  Dizzy and the others open fire simultanously. The whole area goes white hot in the magnesium flash of so many pulse cannons. Shujumi fires wildly at advancing insects.   Retrieval !  A hopper pounces on Kitten Smithm, and he goes down screaming.    consisting of STARSHIPS, their tender, FREIGHTERS and other SUPPLY CRAFT.   Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...   Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.   Is your Lieutenant as bad as they say ?  Birdie belts him, and Ace goes down.   Sounds like he is quite a guy.  SERGEANT GILLESPIE, 28, steps into the room.   We get you, sir !  He points at Johnny's earring with his steel hand.   There.  Rockets take out warriors. Bug guts go flying. Dizzy sets workers on fire. Johnnx and Ace step over burning bug carcasses to the rim of the hole and fire their gas rounds.   No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.   Agghh ! It's making me sick...!  The plasma bug writhes in pain and begins to swell, color changing from yellow to blue in accordance with some violent internal chemical reaction.    leads a little quartet, plays a sweet fiddle. Roughnecks laugh and dance. Dizzy tries to pull Johnny into the fun.    sees something out of the corner of his eye.   Lieutenant, I think you're gonna wanna see this, sir.   Dirty bugs came in right when they were having chow !   Officer on the deck, sir.   Lieutenant, we got trouble !   Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!   Getting low here, sir !   Officer on the deck !  Roughnecks fall in. Johnny steps into the room. There are many new and much younger faces.   We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...   Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.    begins to take a toll on the battle group as the orbiting ships lay their eggs. Cap Troopers are scliced as they drop.   Fleet Command says retrieval's no go. The battle group's at safe distance... and we got another problem.  Ace points out a Tanker bug that's been brough up to the rim. Johnny sees another.

He points at the hole of the dead major's head.   Oh, you can be sure of it ! They were biding their time... waiting for the most opportune moment !  Rasczak's lost interest in the general. He's on the com.   They weren't gonna do it to me. Oh no ! I know too many secrets !  Rasczak looks at General Owen with contempt.    blinks as he steps out into the light. Roughnecks snap to attention. General Owen looks at the carnage that was once his command and begins to keen, collapsing to his knees.   Oh God...! My soldiers...! All of my boys and girls...!  The Roughnecks are shocked. They've never seen a general break down before. Lieutenant Rasczak slaps Owen hard.   I know... I wish you'd shoot me...   What's it thinking, Colonel ?

        "Owen": "Get out... you gotta get me out...!   At ease, Lieutenant. Thank God for you, for all of you...this is grand... so where's the boat ?   I was forced to hide, of course. The security of the Federation in this theater of operations was at stake !   They get in your mind... they make you do things ! Look here... They did it to Farley...!  He points at the hole of the dead major's head.   Oh, you can be sure of it ! They were biding their time... waiting for the most opportune moment !  Rasczak's lost interest in the general. He's on the com.   They weren't gonna do it to me. Oh no ! I know too many secrets !  Rasczak looks at General Owen with contempt.    blinks as he steps out into the light. Roughnecks snap to attention. General Owen looks at the carnage that was once his command and begins to keen, collapsing to his knees.   Oh God...! My soldiers...! All of my boys and girls...!  The Roughnecks are shocked. They've never seen a general break down before. Lieutenant Rasczak slaps Owen hard.   I know... I wish you'd shoot me...",

        "Zim": "is 40, astoundingly fit, and like all drill instructors, he carries a small baton. He addresses sixty shorn RECRUITS.   The problem with you is that none of you are good enough the way you are.  Johnny stands in formation with his squad, among them:  BRECKINRIDGE, 18, DJANA'D, 19, KATRINA McINTIRE, 18, ACE LEVY, 18, SHUJUMI, 18, and KITTEN SMITH, 18.    I am your senior drill instructor, Career Sergeant Zim.   Do you think I'm funny ? Do I make you laugh ? Do you think I'm a comedian ?  Kitten Smith shake his head  \"no\" , but he can't stifle himself.   The first and last words out of your stinking holes will be \"sir\". Do you get me ?   See the armory ? Run around it !  Kitten Smith squints. Out in the distance, a tiny building. Zim smacks him on the leg with his baton.   RUN, I SAID. Bronski, keep pace !  Kitten Smith runs. Big CORPORAL BRONSKI, 28, takes out after him, laying a baton across his backside every time he slows.   You are now all brothers and sisters in the same family, my family, the Mobile Infantery. I will be your mother. I will be your father. If you do not please me I will throw you out of my family because I hate all slackers and negative hackers. Do you get me ?   Anytime you think I'm being to tough, anytime you think I'm being unfair... QUIT ! Grab your gear and take a stroll down \"Washout Lane\". Get me ?   I wonder if there's a handful of guts in the whole bunch. Who thinks they've got what it takes to knock me down ?  Breckinridge, a big guy from a farm planet, steps forward.   You alright, Breckinridge ?    Good. Who's next ?  Shujumi steps up, assumes a fighting stance. Zim looks him over. There's not not much to him. Shujumi attacks Zim, counters his counter, dances out of range.    Some of you may not Â´make it.  Djana'd hits a tower and falls to the deck hard, dropping her rifle. She holds her knee, hurt. Zim races over to her.    You might think I am unfair.   Is that all you got ? You hit like kitten, Smith ! This is a punch.  WHAM !Zim knocks Kitten Smith for a loop.   You will not like me.    watches the recruits face simulated 3-D OFF-WORLD FOES. In one room, CYCLOPS SOLDIERS of Antilles, in another, red DEATH WALKERS, and in a third, screeching ARACHNID WARRIORS.   But if you survive you will thank me because you will be born again hard. You will be a new person. You will be a Cap Trooper. And then, MAYBE, you'll  be good enough...    throws a knife, buries the point in a narrow post.   ...to serve in my family.   Put your hand on the post, private.  Ace obeys. Zim throws, sticks his hand to the post.   The enemy cannot push a button if you disable his hand. MEDIC !  Zim pays no attention to Ace who remains stuck to the post. A recruit trots up. Johnny stares, surprised. It's Dizzy.   I see you specifically requested transfer from Fort Cronkite to this training group...  Dizzy grins self-consciously at Johnny.   It is the best... BUT WHAT MAKES YOU  C'mon, move it, you apes !   The object of this exercise is to capture your enemy's flag before your enemy captures yours.  Bronski passes out Morita SmartRifles.   These weapons have been modified for this exercise. If your enemy hits you, your suit will fail. You will be unable to move. You will be as good as dead.    watch Johnny firing both Moritas simultanously and taking out the remaining Red Team defenders. He grabs the Red Team flag and hurls it into the air like spear.   Kid's got some moves...   Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !   Don't stand there dumb... GO !  Johnny jumps, plummeting toward the earth.   With the Marauder's visual capabilities, all you have to do is look at something to hit it, so you will exercise EXTREME CARE on my firing line. Do you get me ?   The live firing combat range is the closest simulation of actual combat we can provide. If you do not hit your target, it will shoot you...  Fifty blackened AUTOMATED TARGET DRONES fitted with pulse guns are presently visible along a gauntlet of low walls, gullies, and three-story building facades.   The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?   Perfect score for this exercise is 300. B company came through last week with 285. I expect you to do better.   Rico, you are relieved of squad command. Levy, McIntire you will escort private Rico to the C.O.'s Office.  The recruits watch Johnny leave, stare aghast at their dead comrade. No one looks at Djana'd, who stands alone sobbing.   Alright, let's go, Rico.  Johnny takes off his shirt. Ace who now holds the chevrons of squad leader, watches, feels bad for his pal.   Bite on this. It helps. I know.    and other staffers watch the grim news unfold. Animation illustrates the insect treachery.   I'm serious, sir. I'll go anywhere. I want combat.   Yes, sir, I get you.   Is that your signature, Rico ?   Doesn't look like it to me.  Zim gives the C.O. a look. The C.O. shrugs, turns away, watching the news of the coming war. Zim tears up the 1240/A.   Get outa here, private."
