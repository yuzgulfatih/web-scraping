        "Megan": "Uncle Mike --  But I have to go now!  Lowrey is standing just outside, portable phone in hand. He's trying to keep his voice low. BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94                                57.  Uncle Mike!  Uncle Mike.   I did it!",
        "Burnett": "-- And I'm Marcus.  No chest hair. And packin'.  Maybe you can come. Get off after you get off?  Lowrey!  (scraped, bruised,  Burnett and his young wife, THERESA, are jarred awake by the CLOCK RADIO BLARING on the night stand. Theresa gropes for RADIO, shuts it OFF. Burnett playfully gropes for her.  We're always saying we should spend more quality time together. Well, I got the time... and you got the quality...  I can remember when we used to do it every morning.  Been over a week since I've had some quality time!  Pandemonium. There's the two-and-a-half-year-old, MEGAN, who's taking bites of food and spitting it back out, looking at it, then putting it back in. Six-year- old JILL, who is playing refrigerator magnet games on the fridge. And Marcus in the middle of it all, deftly side- stepping his eight-year-old boy, QUINCY, who appears on roller blades whizzing through with a hockey stick and ball. He body-checks Jill against the ice box.  Kids, knock it off... or your momma's gonna whoop your butts!  Burnett's following Lowrey and the kids out his front door when his neighbor, DICK, accosts him from across the hedge.  Hey, Dick. How many times I gotta tell you? I don't work robbery. I'm in Narcotics.  Oh, baby.   Damn.  Twins?  What special effects?  Your kids are lookin' sharp, Francine.  And the women really go for that. Really, they do.  This can't be happening.  How's O'Fee?  Because maybe this guy knows if you kill a cop the whole department'll get up his ass hard and fast.  You're not sayin' this was an inside job. Cops wouldn't pull this shit.  He walks to the center of the room and kneels to those four bolt holes in the floor. He fingers the paraffin filler, then looks above to the air conditioning grate.  What about the air conditioning?    Why me?  Don't say nothin' about my clothes. I paid for these.  Not on a cop's salary.  Burnett crawls up with some help from Lowrey below, stalling the oscillating fan with his cuffs and crawling through. The first thing Burnett notices are the track marks from the bobsled cutting through a coating of dust.  Yeah. I got some weird track marks in here.  There's gonna be a lotta cash when the dope hits the street. We want you to put the word out through your bank and hustle the account.  You help us, maybe we can see about getting those R.T.C. auditors off your ass.  Not a fucking lead. So now that we've done the obvious, we need a shortcut.  Huh uh. Not this time. I'm tired of you working pussy into everything we do.     Huh?  A cop.  You know? I'm a cop. I shot somebody just last week. Didn't kill him, just shot him in the ass.  Green ain't the color I was thinkin' of. More of a coco puff. Just real shiny, thick...  Damn! The woman's got fuckin' radar on my ass. Sensed me lookin' at another woman. Bet she wants me to pick up Huggies 'stead of those baby Garanimals that they wear.  And I plan on living to be old just like 'em. Rubbin' Ben Gay on my joints and everythin'.  I don't have a death wish like you. I  got a family that counts on me.  A mortgage to pay. And I'm not sayin' it's me, but most of the guys in the station think you're some rich kid playin' cop.  I love you, man.  Well, we can leave a note or we can break and enter --  Aw, man.    Did you cut one?  Not me.  Dead guy.  Where are the drugs? Where... are... the... drugs? He ain't sayin' nothin'. He must be guilty of somethin'.  Whoa. Watch where you're swinging them dead arms, Orona. You're gonna fuck up your own crime scene.  Watch what you touch.   That's evidence.  Not touching. Browsing... Mr. Orona. You've got the right to remain silent. Anything you say'll surprise the shit out of us.  Anything?  Lemme guess. Guy does the air conditioning contract for the P.D. He'd have the plans.  Works for me. Now can we go? I'm gonna puke.  enter. But Sanchez and Ruiz are already on the scene.  Looks like you're already doing that.  He drops the sheet on Eddie's body, then moves over to Max's. He doesn't know it's her until --  Jesus, no...  I wouldn't fuck with him right now.  Uh oh... Alright, you check out Lois, then check in --      Theresa, I know it was my idea. I know I was the one who wanted a little quality time.  It's just that this can't wait.  Can't I just wake you up when I get home?  Theresa.     I gotta go.   I can't be Lowrey.  Yo, you are live with Lowrey... Yo, you're live with Lowrey.  Mike Lowrey.  ... 'Cuz I'm Mike Lowrey.      I'm a cop. Wanna see my badge?    What the fuck was that for?  What do you mean I'm not Mike Lowrey? You never even met him! Me.  I'm undercover.  Okay.    I'm way undercover.  I knew her from way back. From time to time, you know... We'd get together. Mess around, you know?  Okay. Okay. So I exaggerated. It's a man thing.  You know what? You don't wanna believe me? That's fine with me! Go it alone.  You don't got any more golf clubs or bats, do you? Nothin' that you can swing at me, do you?  Then lemme introduce myself. I'm Mike Lowrey. And I'm here to help you.  Yeah, well neither are you.      You swing like Barry Bonds.  Alright. Look here, I need to know if you've called anybody. Or if you told anybody else where you are?  Good.     You got a back door?  Protective custody.  Let's go!  Fuck the dog!  Racing through the apartment toward the back door, Burnett wheels with the GUN and FIRES just as Kuni rounds a corner with the SHOTGUN. The room ERUPTS with plaster spray and NOISE. Julie shrieks, and Burnett shoves her through the back door, then spins and FIRES. Kuni tumbles and dies from multiple hits.  Fine time to bark. Where were you when they were comin' up the walk? Shit. Bet they got a look at my license plates. If you saw him again, would you remember the guy who shot Max?  I told you, I'm putting you into protective custody...  Yeah.   I noticed.    My place? Okay, good.   No, wait. My place is wrong.  I mean right. As in good. My place is good. We'll go there first. My place.  Wait here.  He told me I could use the place tonight...    I forgot I had those switches moved. Welcome to Casa del Lowrey.  I uh... I invest.  -- My father invests... Listen. You must be tired --  Fair enough. I'm not on the take. Satisfied? Good. So... why don't you make yourself at home? Here's the T.V. remote. Watch yourself some 'Gilligan's Island' reruns or somethin'.  Heh -- all these damn things look alike. Well, gotta run... There's probably a couple of good steaks in the fridge for the dogs. Help yourself to whatever. I'll check on you in the morning.  Uh, back to the P.D. I got paperwork back on my desk to go through that's about this high. And now there's you, so that makes it this high.  Why shouldn't I? Are you a thief or a vandal?  I didn't ask.  Okay. Important lesson. Julie's not a call girl. Can I go now?  Don't mention it.  It's uh... It's uh...  Lock the door. Don't open it for anybody.  Listen, Chet. The girl? She's a witness. I'm gonna be gone for about an hour. Do me a favor. Keep your eye out, okay?  Just keep an eye out.  As Doris storms toward her bedroom, Burnett trails her, apologetically --  -- I swear, baby, it's nothing. I was on the job --  No!   No!    I got it right here...  If you were a real partner, instead of some no-backup, hot doggin', car chasin', skirt sniffin' motherfucker, I would be gettin' down to business with my wife instead of stuck in this situation.  Chief. I tried to set   the girl up with a sketch artist  but she won't. I tried to get   her to come in and look at the mug  books and she won't come in.  That's right. So let her deal with the real Mike Lowrey! Who, I might add, shoulda been there to take the call instead of runnin' off like a hot dog without any backup.  I had to stash her somewhere! She's scared shitless... just like her dogs.  Big computer.    Expensive --  So what about me? I can't    tell my wife I'm shacked up with a   female witness! Besides, I think    they made my car last night... I   gotta stay close to home, just in   case.  My house ain't no zoo!    Cleveland's where they collared the dealer. And that's where I gotta go to testify.  Honey. I wouldn't go if I didn't have the most trustworthy man I know to look after my family...  Yes, Lowrey. I trust him with my life and, I most certainly trust him with yours.  Baby. It's a Federal subpoena. I'm the witness. I'm the one who has to testify. Case closed. I'm the one going to Cleveland. Lowrey's staying here.  Theresa stands at the door with arms crossed. Meanwhile, Burnett throws his bag in the trunk of the Porsche. He and Lowrey trade car keys, the Porsche for the Volvo.  Don't forget to put Snail Guard on my lawn.  Bye-bye, Theresa. Be good, kids.  Shut up before I step on you... Julie?  Julie!  Yeah.    It's me. Mike.    Special Narcotics Division.  We find the dope, we find our shooter, too.  Man, when this is over, I'm gonna get me somethin' better than quality time. It's gonna be me'n Theresa on a boat --  Mug shots. We got mug shots to look at. 'Scuse me, I gotta hook into the P.D. computer.  That guy? Well, that's Marcus Burnett, my partner.  There's the two of us, see?     Me'n'... ... My partner.  Yeah. Okay. Sure, I can see how it looks that way... But you see... you see... It's uh... a cop thing. That's because I've put a picture up there for every time Marcus has saved my life.  I save his life. He saves mine. He's got the same thing in his house. Pictures of me. More, even. Good family man, that Marcus.  Me? Gay?   Are you outta your mind?  It's a good thing that I'm secure in my manhood to see that you don't mean that. You know how many women I've had in that waterbed? Check the waves as they go by. Count 'em. Now, mug shots?  The shooter said four days until he makes the deal. What else did he say?  Just a few more and we can take another break.  A what?  What had a name.    You sure?  Lowrey is on the phone.  Your dog took a shit.    You cleaned my clothes?  You cleaned my clothes?  What's this??  This is my favorite shirt.   My lucky shirt.  Not going to happen.  Slab of fear?  Alright. I left my wallet at the office so I'll give you some cash tomorrow.  Noah's car is parked down the block.  I'm tellin' you, I've      had it with this witness. I wanna       go home and get back to my life as      it was. I got married so I could      stop lyin'.  Yeah. I know, it's a little big on me. But cool. I figure, what about it? If I'm gonna be Mike, might as well dress like Mike! I wanna be, I wanna be like Mike. Swish.  The wife?  Gimme that phone. Hello, Theresa? Theresa!  Hey, man. Don't mess with me! That's the mother of my children. Don't break up a happy home.  Hey. Don't ask me to find it for you. You're the expert on my wife.  You don't even know where you're going. You're in the wrong aisle.  You think you know what Theresa needs, man, but I do this every month. Just look for 'Fresh Days.'  So? He's a new recruit. Keep looking, will ya? 'Fresh Days.'  Hey, this what husband's do.  Hey, man, look! You're not even reading. These are panty liners, okay?  That's a whole 'nother category of thing! Man, for a guy that spends all his time chasing pussy, you sure don't know much about the woo woo. Here it is. Fresh Days. You pay for it.  What are we gonna be today? Postal Inspectors or Water and Power?  What do you think the chain's for?  Well, the anchor just moved.  AAAAAAAAAAA-Animal Control!  That's too bad. Because his lion's tied to your trailer. So you gotta move the beast. Or move the trailer.  Well, little kitty's gonna be gator bait 'less you suddenly remember where your brother is.  It's me, Julie...  Yes. We were going to a club.     As in me and my partner.  What?  How did you get in here?    You don't quit stalking me, Yvette, I'm gonna place your ass under arrest! -- 'Bye!  Just that crazy Yvette, stalking me again.  That woman's into some weird shit.  We, as in Marcus and I, are going to Club Hell. We're gonna nail this Noah guy and get him to give up Max's shooter. Anyone got a problem with that?  Yeah, well this case is messin' with mine, too.  Hey, man. Got some bad news. Your car got busted into. There's some uniformed boys in the parking lot wanting to ask you some questions.  Sounds good to me.  Gin and tonic... ... And add twenty for yourself.  Bartender says he works here. But she hasn't seen him all night. I gotta make a pitstop.  Oh, man.     Budweiser...  Musta drank about a million Budweisers tonight, waitin' for my ol' friend Noah to show. Wouldn't know him, would ya? Guy practically raised me up from nothin'.  Too bad.  Burnett's gun lays amongst the flapping carp and sea- weed on the floor. Both Burnett and Casper go sliding across the wet floor and into a stall -- both reaching for the gun. Burnett's there a second too late. Casper's got the gun. He swings it onto Burnett and squeezes the trigger. But nothing happens. Burnett in turn, grabs Casper's ears and hammers the big guy's head into the toilet until he falls unconscious. Burnett picks up his gun.  Next time, learn how to work the safety with your punk ass. Now where's my no good, no back-up partner?  Don't even think about it. Julie?  Burnett sees that Noah's on the run. So he cold-cocks Ferguson with the butt of his pistol and joins the chase.  Appear at the door, charging down the steps toward the valet and commandering a Taurus that just pulled up. All three dive in. Burnett behind the wheel.  I'm driving.     Buckle up.  Do I backseat drive when you're tailing a hitman?   There goes our only lead to the dope. We better call Howard.  No more. Fuck this. I'm               Chill, I'll handle it. not goin' with it... No, I'm                (starts after out. I'm out. Somethin's                     Julie wrong with her. Crazy woman!          Julie! Just wait a Burnett keeps moving and grousing while Lowrey chases Julie down and snags her by the arm.  Jesus.   What kinda shit was in there?  We'll get a sample and drop it back at the lab. Meanwhile, why don't you two go on back to Club Hell and see what you can dig up on these bad guys.  As Lowrey is checking the upstairs, he finds himself staring in on the sleeping kids.  That's perfectly alright --  Sure.  I'm on protective duty. And I want you to feel... protected. So I'm dressed and ready. It's okay. I've done it before.  Sure he would. It's a cop thing.  You do?  Well, I drove.  I shot the gas tank on the car.  Theresa.   Why?  What's that supposed to mean?  Funny?  Yeah... I feel a little funny.  What kind of funny?  I gotta call Marcus.  I'm different. I'm a cop.     And now I gotta kill a guy.  From the top of the stairs we see and hear...  I got some jewelry for you.  Just shut the fuck up. I won't be long. Try and keep out of sight.  Lowrey climbs under blanket on sofa, the back of which faces the window. Exhausted, he turns off light and closes his eyes. A beat. Burnett's face pops up furtively in window, his nose pressed against the glass, looking for evidence of adultery. He can't see Lowrey asleep on the couch. His head drops below the window frame, only to reappear in another window. Seeing nothing, he moves on.  Burnett skulks into the side yard.  The light in Theresa's bedroom is on. He sees her sil- houette against the curtain getting undressed.  He climbs the trellis to second story; boosts himself onto ledge, inches along. Stops to peer into a window when the ledge under his feet crumbles and...  falls. Landing flat on his back on the awning. His eyes close with a look that says \"saved.\" But then as he moves. Something CREAKS.  Seemingly stuck, once again, he attempts to move. Another, even LOUDER CREAK, then --  He crawls to his feet and as he looks up at the damage he's done --  He sees Lowrey in his underwear and Theresa in her night- gown as they part the curtains and look out.  In the bushes.   He assumes the worst.  ... You doin' Theresa?    Theresa!  I hope you used protection... 'cause I don't want a fourth kid that looks like you!      Yeah, I wouldn't want to spoil your little arrangement!  She's in the car. Got her cuffed to the steering wheel.    Okay.   What are we doing about it?  A tow truck has pulled up to the sedan and hooked it. Sanchez operates the winch and Ruiz GUNS the ENGINE.  On the front lawn. Satisfied grin on his face, he returns to the house.  enter.   Just as file cabinets are hand-trucked by them.  Hey.   What's goin' on here?  Yeah. I guess you're tellin' the truth.  Yeah, but Julie told me his ship comes in on Friday? You wanna tell me who can cut a hundred mil worth a dope in five days? You'd need whole lotta time cards to make that kinda date.  Hey, Jojo.  Hey, calm down. A little rap, that's all. We're lookin' for someone who can step on a shitload of heroin. And do it real fast, and real well. We're lookin' for a pro.  We're not playin' around with you, Jojo. You know what we want.  Now there's a lotta dope, Jojo. Who can cut it quick?  What are you doin', man?  We don't got time for            Mike. Chill with that. this. Jojo, I'm gonna            No. Don't do it! This kill you, man. I've got          is illegal! He's just fifteen bullets and I'm          a white ganja-smokin' gonna fill your rasta            motherfucker. He ain't ass fulla some hot               worth it. shit... Wait. Wait. Burnett pushes in one last time and tries to talk Lowrey back. Lowrey acts like he lost it. He pulls another gun and points it at Burnett.  Back up. I'm gonna bust          Right on. Jojo, you're your fuckin' ass too.            on your own. Talk to me. Tell me what         I was on your side. I'll I want to know. I'll do          just be over here. I you man, say it. Come on.        don't want no skull    What?    Be nice. After tomorrow we might need 'em for a job reference.  Oh, that's not how you frisk a potential lawbreaker. You gotta start at the waistband. See if he's carrying a piece.  Not.  Now, some rent-a-cops have licenses to carry weapons,  where others do not. Which might   you be? You wouldn't happen to   have those permits handy, would  you?  I bet you miss your wife, kids... I bet you miss them a whole lot.  Theresa gives a peek out the window.       There's another suspicious car on the street.  Sanchez and Ruiz are on protective duty in front of Burnett's house.  Coral Gables stakeout. Julie's passed out and, once again, sleeping in the rear of the car. In the glow of the faltering streetlights and the approaching dawn, she couldn't look more beautiful. And from his post in the driver's seat, he's looking at her with a longing that goes well beyond lust. Then Burnett breaks the silence.  Two o'clock.     The red Civic.   Let's just hope he didn't come home for a nap.  They've made us. Let's move.  Lowrey's driving in his typical, pedal to the metal style while Burnett talks on the radio.  Yeah. Tell Howard to assemble the troops. We just made the dope lab. We'll be at the P.D. in one hour.  Typical pandemonium. Theresa is making/serving breakfast while the TV BLARES. Quincy is channel surfing on the TV when he comes up with the news footage of the explosion, followed by more footage of Lowrey, Julie, and Burnett at the scene.  Bang, they're through the door.   Grubby and tired from the all-night stakeout.  Third drawer down. Hey, Julie. Do me a favor and see who that is.  Theresa.     It's not how it looks.  Theresa. She's a material witness! It was orders!  Pushes Theresa back into the elevator, making her lay on the floor as BULLETS CUT above.  Into the open elevator, Burnett slides his gun over to her.  Go upstairs. And don't let anybody in but me... Do it!  Appears behind Lowrey. Lowrey waves him in another direction. Burnett hauls one way. Lowrey the other.  He rolls, makes it to one knee.   But his other leg gives way.  We lost the girl.  Bogus address?  How'd he know we were gearing up to go? It's like he's known all along where we're gonna be and when.  Three little angels. Julie kept talking about his three little angels.  Where out pops a picture of his three children.  (looking at his  standing over her desk.  He wanted someone inside the P.D.?  Anything you can tell us about him?  Call Howard. Tell him we're gonna need lotsa back-up.  We can make better time if we cut across the Biscayne Bridge.  That's it. That's where they're making the deal.  Mouths shut, feet moving.    Now, walk.  Easing through the wreckage, ever-so-cautious.  Signals between the two. They split wider.   Moving toward those locked doors.  Each placing their faces against their own sleeves.    The smoke is thicker, swirling in waves.  Let her go and you'll walk. You can keep the dope and the money. Just the girl and we all get out of here.  As he looks back on the conflagration.  Sanchez and Ruiz...  UNLOAD their CLIPS in a CRESCENDO of GUNFIRE.    Fouchet crumples in a heap.  Hey, hey... Let's go get our jobs back.  The front door opens and all the little Burnetts come screaming out...  Daddy Daddy Daddy the hero!!!  Daddy's home!  Uncle Mike, Uncle Mike.  Baby!  Hey.    Where are the kids goin'?  You mean...",
        "Casper": "Aw, man. You got blood on my new suit.  As they try running across the harsh-tiled roof...  Now look. My fuckin' shoes.      My fuckin' Italian shoes!     Excuse me?  Sorry.   Never heard of him.  Okay, hardon!    Tell me where the girl is!  Burnett's gun lays amongst the flapping carp and sea- weed on the floor. Both Burnett and Casper go sliding across the wet floor and into a stall -- both reaching for the gun. Burnett's there a second too late. Casper's got the gun. He swings it onto Burnett and squeezes the trigger. But nothing happens. Burnett in turn, grabs Casper's ears and hammers the big guy's head into the toilet until he falls unconscious. Burnett picks up his gun.  Casper spots Burnett nearing the house.  There's our guy. Watch him.  Casper and Ferguson look curiously as the lid rolls into the street.  They can't believe their eyes.  Casper sees the girl.  Sonofabitch!   There's the girl!  Move to open the doors. They give a good shove.   Still nothing. So they bang and shout.  Hey! Wake up out there!     Open it up!  charge.   GUNS BLASTING.  Looking through the flames. Shielding their eyes.     Ruiz and Sanchez appear from behind.",
        "Noah": "As they try running across the harsh-tiled roof...  The plates on Burnett's Volvo.     Each moving through the crowd toward Lowrey and Julie. Guns with silencers held tight to their sides.  Noah's already up to 70 MPH, races through a yellow light, hangs a left. As the light turns red --  Noah is waving a SHOTGUN out the back -- FIRES --  His wheels catch the island and the snaps, and rolls right into --",

So he cold-cocks Ferguson with the butt of his pistol and joins the chase.  Casper spots Burnett nearing the house.  They can't believe their eyes.  Wanna explain what this shit's about?

Capone had the place fixed up with secret passages and hidden stairways. Can you dig it? People were actually killed within these walls.  Wow, Maxi. I thought you dropped off the edge of the earth and died. Either that or you moved to California.  No. Don't go yet. We can party. Just us three. Look at what Eddie's got to play with.  Just a hooker --    You fucker... fucker fucker fucker!!!  Hey, man.   You need me.  Fouchet UNLOADS THREE MORE SHOTS.    BAM BAM BAM!!!   Blood spatters onto Casper.",

        "Theresa": "Marcus, what are you doing?  That was how we got a three bedroom house filled with little Burnetts.  Quincy, never-you-mind. And take those things off in the house! Jill, stop with the book and eat your breakfast. Marcus, why do I always have to discipline the kids? You play bad cop for a second.  Don't kiss me, Lowrey. I don't know where those lips were last night.  Don't go tellin' my son about your sleazy sex life?  I don't want him knowing about it either! Gives him ideas. Hello? Oh, sure. Which one of them do you want?  Not so fast. You were going to take the kids to school today, remember, hon? I have a job interview...  Marcus... I need you to stop at Save-More on the way home and pick up exactly what's on the list.  You never had to go to Cleveland on police business before.  But what about us? The neighborhood's had all break-ins. I won't feel safe if you're --  Oh, no,   Not Lowrey. Not in my house.  Why don't they send him to Cleveland?  Why's he taking your car?  Where you think you're going? I got a list here of things that Marcus was supposed --  Standing in the doorway.   Hands on her hips.  Thank you, but I'll tuck the kids in. Say good night to Uncle Mike.  If you were my husband, I'd poison that.  Twelve years I'm married, Michael. And I never let Marcus bring his work home.  We don't need any violence in this household and we certainly don't need any more heroes. What we need is a father and a husband.  You wanna know why I page him? Because until that phone rings, I don't know whether he's dead or alive. And lemme tell you. Those three minutes I'm waiting for him to call back? Those are the hardest three minutes for a cop's wife.  Sheets and pillows are in the hope chest. I'll see you in the morning.   (starts crying  You think he'll like it? I mean, I want him to, you know, want to...  Yeah.   Good night, Uncle Mike.  The light in Theresa's bedroom is on. He sees her sil- houette against the curtain getting undressed.  Theresa hears SOMETHING and runs to the door and calls out.  Mike!  I heard a noise... I think someone's outside...  He sees Lowrey in his underwear and Theresa in her night- gown as they part the curtains and look out.   Mike?   Are you okay!  Kids, you go over to the neighbors' house. I'll be right back.  Mommy's going to Cleveland.  Announce this!  Oh, I got plenty in me to kill 'em both. But it's the short one I'm gonna divorce.  Save your crap, Mike.  It ain't Cleveland, neither.  You stayed away from home just one night too many, Marcus.  Into the open elevator, Burnett slides his gun over to her.  Marcus, I love you.  Didn't you know? We got us a new babysitter.  It's quality time, Marcus.",

        "Lowrey": "Good evening.    I'm Mike --  We're lookin' for a couple of our Latin friends who checked in a little while ago. You might remember them?  Oh, didn't they say? There's going to be party! It's  Police!   On the floor!  appears soon after, walking down the hotel steps, leading the Latina in his cuffs, and wearing his jacket.  What?       Ah, family life. Reminds me why I stay single. Uncle Mike!   Uncle Mike!  Hiya, kids.   Mornin', Theresa.  I promise, Theresa. I only tell your husband about my sleazy sex life.  You're live with Lowrey. 'Scuse me, Captain. I think you mean to say, 'Get the fuck down here, please?'  Don't get your sticky fingers all over my windows... and keep your feet off the seats, I just had the leather conditioned.  If I'm lyin' I'm dyin'. Her sister came down and posted the girl's bail. And later? Man, talk about special effects.  Tell you later -- Mornin', Francine. Where's the smile?  If it ain't the leftovers from Miami Vice. Fashion casualties, lost somewhere in the eighties.  So I guess we should start with the C.I.s and the perps from the original case. But hell if I know any dope dealers with the balls to pull this off. They're either dead or in the lock-up pending trial.  Hey, fuck you and your cheap, off- the-rack suit.  Nothing like a little old-fashioned incentive.  I think you should go ahead, crawl up and give it a good look.  For one, it was your idea. Two, while my suit's fresh, you're dressed for the occasion.  And I don't?  Anything?  Listen, Cedras. You and I both know you're the number one importer for the Simona Brothers. And I'm tellin' you there's a buttload of H on the move and someone's gonna wanna stick their dick in it. So it better not be yours. You hear something? You call us. You hear nada? You better get the fuck outta town.  Okay.   So we talk to Max.  You got a better idea?     Raincheck, darlin'. Gotta talk. Anyplace we can go?  Sorry to come around only when I need something.  Hey, I didn't open my mouth. Listen, there's some major, major ill shit happening down at the P.D. Lotta heroin involved. There's gonna be a lotta cash involved, too. Gonna be some happy motherfuckers around that wanna party.  Just make a coupla calls. See what's what. Don't be doin' no wild shit. Just call me if you hear something.  You know, that was really smooth. Think you could do that again? Ohh. I'll tell you, when the wife gets meaner, the grass gets greener.  I don't think anybody could be that married.    You gonna let every old motherfucker pass you? Or just the ones with big-ass trailers draggin' behind? A-c-c-el-er-ate.  Who said that?  If somebody's talking about me, I wanna know... Man, I'm so sick of this. I don't apologize for nothing I do. I get up early and take it to the max every day. I'm always the first guy through the door. And the last guy to leave a crime scene. So fuck 'em all. I could give a shit what those boot lickin', brown-nosin', ass kissin' motherfuckers think of Mike Lowrey.  Oh, fuck you, Marcus.  Yeah. Roger that. Gimme the address.  The air conditioning business has been good to Orona.  Wait. Hear that? I thought I heard Orona beating his wife.  Uh oh.    No alarm.  No, man.    Musta been you.  Dead guy.  Now what?    He trades the plans for his paper and gets popped by the perps.  enter. But Sanchez and Ruiz are already on the scene.  I think we    got us a witness. Over here    I got two different shades of    lipstick on one champagne    glass.  Whatcha got?  What?     Who is it?  I shoulda told you to be careful.  Eddie Dominguez. I want his phone calls.  I'm sorry.     Maybe I wasn't polite enough.  Three calls to Lois Fields. I'm going to stop by her place and tell her a bedtime story. You can catch a ride with Howard.    Laying next to him.    It SQUAWKS LOUDLY...  Burnett's Volvo pulls into the circular driveway of Oceanview Terrace.  The door opens, Burnett gropes awkwardly in the dark for the light switch. Finally finds it.  Hi. You're live with Lowrey. Leave it at the beep.  Yeah.   Thanks for the get-well card.  Hey. I'm not the one who left a strange hooker alone in my apartment. You know, she's probably on the street sellin' all my shit as we speak.  Dogs, too? I got Persian rugs, man. I'm going home... explain the whole thing, take her to the Motel Six, she'll understand...  Yeah, I got a computer and you shouldn't touch it. It took me weeks to get it set up the way I want it and I don't want amateurs messing with it.  No way!   I'm not living in that zoo.  Just leave Cleveland the way you found it.    -- that Marcus was supposed to do. That's right. Marcus. Not Mike. 'Cuz Mike's a cop on a case with no time to waste.  Burnett enters and instantly those DOGS of hers are  Burnett and Julie are sitting at the computer looking at mug shots dialed in from the police database. She fiddles with, but does not eat her salad, while stealing sideways glances from the computer screen to the nasty, bologna sandwich Burnett is eating.  Captain Howard, please.    It's Lowrey.  Lowrey is standing just outside, portable phone in hand. He's trying to keep his voice low. BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94                                57.  I just talked to Marcus. The girl just I.D.'d one of the shooters --  Okay... Hang on, Cappy. This is Prudence and she has to go potty. This is a potty. Everyone has to poop and when they do they use the potty. Mommies poop. Daddies poop. Captain Howard poops. Even doggies poop.  Burnett is cleaning up dog shit    from one of Lowrey's Persian rugs. The stain won't     come out. So Burnett tries a can that he's grabbed.     It foams. Julie appears with a pile of clean laundry in    hand.  ... so your daddy and I are trapped in this crack house in Little Havana. These dudes were real mean mothers... and they start coming at us with knives... Now I'm scared, thinkin' I'm out for the count when in comes your daddy like a Miami hurricane --  Oh, hi, Theresa. Just tellin' the kids about --  G'night, gang.  If you were my wife I'd drink it.  Just a harmless bedtime story. Thought the kids deserved to know about the hero they have for a dad.  Husband? Theresa. He's your personal errand boy. You beep the poor S.O.B. every hour on the Goddamn hour? And why is it always about some useless bullshit that can wait until later. I mean, the guy's gotta job to do.    The CAMERA STARTS ON a beautiful SHOT of Julie sleeping in the bedroom, then PULLS BACK AND SWIVELS to reveal Burnett on the couch. Gun laid across his chest. He lays awake while Luke and Duke sniff at his feet.  You should recognize trunk. It's the one you came to America in.  Oh, please. Big fucking deal. You know what I had to do? I drove your kids to school this morning. Your son forgot his homework. So I had to drive him all the way back in that junker of yours -- What's that you're wearin'? Is that my new silk shirt? Is that my shirt?  Ugh.   I gotta call the wife.  Yeah, what's up, baby. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. What else? You want me do what?  Mmm. Uh-huh. Hectic down here. I'll be in, nine. Nine-thirty. The kids alright? How's that potty thing? Yeah? Okay. Alright.  Say, why don't you rent a movie or somethin'? Uh-huh. You're so silly.  So, baby.   What you wearin'?  Man, it's off. It was a joke.  Marcus, this is crazy. We are five minutes away from picking up this asshole and returning to our lives. And we're here doin' this shit. Where the fuck is it?  You know, this is like some really bizarre shit that you're on right now. Your wife asked me to do this, and I'm doin' it. Besides, I'm you, remember?  You're unbalanced. Listen, I read the parole jacket on this guy Noah. Armed robbery. Attempted murder. He's a violent offender somethin' like nine times. Sweet guy. Not a single drug bust on his sheet.  You know, it is a damn shame she makes you buy this stuff.  Terrible fuckin' job. It's like shaving cream. They're all the same. Fresh. Free. Confident. Secure. Super wide? What the fuck? We're takin' this one.  Water and Power.  I dunno. Maybe some kind of hurricane anchor.  We're undercover! Now, we're lookin' for the owner of that animal.  Everglades. Only part of South Florida that's zoned for Wild Kingdom shit. 'Course, the crocks down there'll probably eat your brother's cat.  Lowrey and Burnett pull up in the unmarked police car. Chet is there to help with the door.  Keys in the door and Burnett and Lowrey enter the apartment. Julie's DOGS run up to them, YAPPING.  Very nice.   The occasion?  What's that on the rug?    Looks like... a stain?  And have you ever heard of a new invention called the 'coaster'?  No. It's not my place. My wife. She's a designer. She decorated the whole place at a discount just for Mike. And when she hears about how he's been taking care of -- Off the couch!  Where the lock on the front door turns. The door opens. A mysterious WOMAN in an overcoat, sunglasses and spiked heels enters.  'The hell's going on out here??  Yvette!? You didn't just send away Yvette?  You are ruining my life!  Julie, still dressed for the evening, paces back and forth. Frustrated, she rips the tag from her dress, and sits back down at the computer. She plays with the keyboard and Noah's mug shot pops back into view. She stares at it a little too intently. Images flash in front of her, the sights and sounds of Max's death replaying itself in her mind. Snapping out of it, determined, she gathers her bag and exits.  I say we split the room in half. Make our own moves. Hook back up at the bar in twenty minutes.  Anything?  He's been watching the  fish in the tank, but turns back toward the bar just at  the moment of Burnett's impact. The tank cracks on the  bathroom side and water begins draining, unbeknownst  to Lowrey.  He sees Julie charging across the dance floor.   She's heading right for him.  What the hell are you doing here?  (starts moving her    The music's too loud.    What you say about angels?  Launches himself off a nearby table, soars over the frightened crowd and comes crashing down upon Noah. Both Lowrey and Noah tumble to the floor. Noah's gun skitters into the crowd. Noah chases for it, but can't find it. But --  No shit!  Appear at the door, charging down the steps toward the valet and commandering a Taurus that just pulled up. All three dive in. Burnett behind the wheel.  Lemme drive!  You're gonna drive through that, aren't you?  Hold that.  C'mon, lemme drive --   I think we protected your uninvited butt pretty good back there.  No more. Fuck this. I'm               Chill, I'll handle it. not goin' with it... No, I'm                (starts after out. I'm out. Somethin's                     Julie wrong with her. Crazy woman!          Julie! Just wait a Burnett keeps moving and grousing while Lowrey chases Julie down and snags her by the arm.  Hey, hey. Just relax! Okay. It's true this whole thing started with missing drugs. But somebody I cared about. A lot. She got killed. And I'm not gonna lay down until this guy is dead or put away... And I promise you, we'll take care of you.  Hey. What do I gotta say?     I need you, okay? I need you.  Nah. Some smooth shit I got on my own.  Smells like some kinda chemical.  One day, bro.    Gotta get yourself some of them.  Hey, hey.   That's not cryin' I hear.    Okay. Just a minor fashion faux paux. Those cappuccinos at lunch can do that to you... See what else we got here.  Burnett is preparing the couch with a pillow and blanket when he sniffs at the air. Something foul. Burnett lowers his nose to the cushions. The smell gets worse.  Burnett crawls into the bed, fully clothed. This is awkward. Julie calls out from the bathroom.  That's right.    Turn around.  Want to? Baby. Someone I know's gonna burn you right to the ground. Get ready! You're on the mic with Mike... Hello?  CAMERA is TIGHT ON Burnett's face. He's angry as he stares at the phone. His worst fears have been confirmed. He hangs up.  An angry Burnett, pulling on a jacket, he throws some clothes at Julie.  G'night, everybody.  Hey, Sanchez. It's me Lowrey... Yeah? Same to you, pal. But listen. I got something you'll want a piece of.  What's the matter?  Go into the kids' room, turn the lights out and wait there until I come get you.  Tumbles into the flower bed. Lowrey reels with     an elbow, dropping Burnett to the lawn. But Burnett rolls     and clips Lowrey's legs. Lowrey falls. Crawls for      his gun. Gets hold of it, turns and is ready to fire when    --  Marcus!   What the fuck --  What?   Me and Theresa?    This whole deal has turned you stupid. You're seeing things that aren't there.  I'm fine, Theresa! Will you get the hell out of here before she sees you! You're supposed to be in Cleveland.  And where's Julie? You didn't leave her again.    Good. So who do you think's in there? Ed McMahon come to tell us we're sweepstakes winners?  We're doing nothing. I've got it handled. In the meantime, you better get back to where you belong before I shoot you myself.  On the front lawn. Satisfied grin on his face, he returns to the house.  Burnett enters with Julie in tow. He looks defeated, grass stains on his clothes, mussed hair. And here comes Chet.  enter.   Just as file cabinets are hand-trucked by them.  Wait a minute. That's my desk!    Or one really smart sonofabitch.  Good runnin' into you, Jojo.  We don't got time for            Mike. Chill with that. this. Jojo, I'm gonna            No. Don't do it! This kill you, man. I've got          is illegal! He's just fifteen bullets and I'm          a white ganja-smokin' gonna fill your rasta            motherfucker. He ain't ass fulla some hot               worth it. shit... Wait. Wait. Burnett pushes in one last time and tries to talk Lowrey back. Lowrey acts like he lost it. He pulls another gun and points it at Burnett.  Back up. I'm gonna bust          Right on. Jojo, you're your fuckin' ass too.            on your own. Talk to me. Tell me what         I was on your side. I'll I want to know. I'll do          just be over here. I you man, say it. Come on.        don't want no skull    Man. Will you get off this? You're making me sick.  Yeah.   Somethin' yummy.  Oh, man.     It's the fuckin' pretend police.  Excuse me. One moment. Let's fuck with these bozos.  Now, where were we?  Whoah. You better watch it, fellahs! You know, it would be very bad if you shot and killed two helpless pimps and a call girl... But it would be even worse if you shot two policemen and their witness on a stakeout.     I don't worry. They're in good hands.  Coral Gables stakeout. Julie's passed out and, once again, sleeping in the rear of the car. In the glow of the faltering streetlights and the approaching dawn, she couldn't look more beautiful. And from his post in the driver's seat, he's looking at her with a longing that goes well beyond lust. Then Burnett breaks the silence.  I'm on him. Hey, buckle up back there.  Lowrey's driving in his typical, pedal to the metal style while Burnett talks on the radio.  You're gonna keep your sweet ass nice and quiet back at my place.  Mike's place.     I said Mike's.  Bang, they're through the door.   Grubby and tired from the all-night stakeout.  Julie is framed in the bedroom doorway, somewhat sadly watching Burnett and Lowrey scramble to get ready for the bust.  That's the plan... So, Mike. Loan some of those ass kicking clothes.  Man, I can't wait to see the look on Howard's face when we tell him... Holy shit! Hi, Theresa... honey.  Mike what?     What'd he do?  Where's Julie?  Julie's inside. She hits the close door button.    But Lowrey's there to catch it.  Julie. We wanted to tell you... I especially wanted to tell you --  Julie --  We still need you.  The elevator doors open and Julie makes for exit. She sees a cab parked outside, slips back on her spiked heel and starts to run for it when --  Julie!   Drop now!  Slips behind a pillar as BULLETS WHIZ past.  Swings around the pillar, gun leveled and running after them.  Julie!!!!  Into the open elevator, Burnett slides his gun over to her.  Fouchet shoves Julie into a waiting car. All three bad guys pile in and the CAR PEELS RUBBER just as Lowrey makes the doorway. Lowrey doesn't stop. He doesn't even wait for traffic. In nothing but his underwear, he appears from the building, turns the corner out the door, launches into traffic like a shot, spinning off bumpers, chasing Fouchet's car on foot.  Turns the corner, running up over car roofs and hoods. He lowers his gun and tries to draw a bead on Fouchet and the gang. They've got Julie and now they're running.  enters. He dives to the floor as Casper stops and FIRES. BULLETS RIP through the salon walls and mirrors. Lowrey ends up under an old lady's dress.  Don't ever say I wasn't there for you.  At least I'm me again. I'm Lowrey.    He jolts at the sound of GUNFIRE.  He's in a vice.    Duty or the girl.   Then --  You twisted motherfucker... Jojo, you sonofabitch. When I get my hands on you, I swear, I'm gonna kill you. The snitch who tipped us to the dope lab? Turns out to be a bogus address.  You know that once he sells the dope, he's gonna kill her just like he did Max.  If she dies, I'm done with it. The whole cop thing.  standing over her desk.  So you were alone?  Yeah. But does he still trust what you tell him?  Move it or lose it!  Easing through the wreckage, ever-so-cautious.  Julie!  Signals between the two. They split wider.   Moving toward those locked doors.  Each placing their faces against their own sleeves.    The smoke is thicker, swirling in waves.  Either we O.D. on the air or the whole place blows. We're dying anyway.  Drop, Julie!  (hands up for all  UNLOAD their CLIPS in a CRESCENDO of GUNFIRE.    Fouchet crumples in a heap.  Stick around. I'll give you a bullet to bite.  Manana, partner. Peace. Okay, kids. Pile in. And watch the leather and windows this time?  You see anybody complaining?  Little Megan is on the potty.   She catches Lowrey as he passes.",
