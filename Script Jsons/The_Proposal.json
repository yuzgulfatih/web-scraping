        "Ramone": "You are a naughty devil. Ramone goes to work another part of the stage, and when he turns, Margaret jumps off the stage and joins the ladies.  Hey Richard.   Hola mi amo. Margaret recognizes Ramone, the male dancer from last night.     68.  Charged up, ready to go, number changed. Ramone throws Richard a phone.  No problem. Ramone gives Margaret a flirty wave.   She awkwardly waves back. Richard pushes the cart out the front door and does not pay. Margaret is confused.           ...of Richard and Margaret's true love... \"True Love\" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the audience notices.  ...before their family and friends. \"Family and Friends\" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and Geoffrey.   She purses her lips.   He holds on to his chair in order to keep himself seated.  For it is family and friends who taught Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only right that family and friends all celebrate that love here today.     98.  And if there is anyone who has cause why this couple should not be united in marriage and love, they must speak now or forever hold their peace. Gilbertson stays quiet.   Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask. Ramone is about to continue, but something gets his attention. He's not sure what to do.  Mi amo, do you have a question? We reveal that Margaret has her hand halfway up, eyes squinted shut like the new kid in class not sure of herself.  Then why is your hand up?  Can it wait âtil after?",

        "Bob": "Ah.   Our fearless leader and her liege. Margaret smiles.  Pardon?  What?   What are you talking about?  You can't...  It is.   He doesn't do publicity.  But...           This is because I'm your competition. Because I threaten you!",
        "Spaulding": "",
        "Gertrude": "Your dad made me come.  No.   I live here now.  I moved back about six months ago.   I'm teaching second grade.   At Baranof.  Uh, no.   I, ah, got divorced.  Me too.   But hey, we're being rude, I wanna meet the bride. Gertrude leaves Richard and goes to Margaret.     39.  Hi, I'm Gertrude.   But call me Gert.  A family name from hell.  Oh Please.   Ancient history.   So tell me everything.   I hear it wasn't exactly love at first sight?  Is that a salmon down your pants? The room laughs as Hank works his crotch millimeters away from Margaret's face.   Margaret remains straight faced.  They can be a little overwhelming, but they're great people.  Around the solstice they don't watch the clock.   Pretty much party âtil they fall over.  I actually missed it when I was in the states.  Yeah.   Since college.  Six months now.   Call me crazy, but I love it.   Think I'm back for good.  Neimans?   Starbucks?   Escalators? Margaret laughs.   She likes this woman.  Yeah.   I miss it.   Believe me, growing up I never thought I'd end up divorced and back here teaching at my old elementary school. That was always Richard's plan.   No.   I was going to teach, he was going to run his dad's business.   He was like a little old man.   Had it all worked out.  What do you mean?         Did he ever tell you why we broke up?  Oh.   Well I should shut up...  He proposed to me.   When we were seniors. Margaret laughs.  He bought this sweet little ring, and got down on his knee.   It was so cute.  ... freaked out?   Oh you bet.   I broke up with him on the spot.  After getting rejected the first time, I can't imagine how hard it was for him to get up the courage to ask you. Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is being so honest with her.  Anyway.   The idea that my little old man could be a player...   It's just not the Richard I knew.   Good thing you're making an honest man of him again.     52. Gertrude toasts Margaret and knocks back the rest of her beer in one swig.   She has a hard time finishing it off.  Well I'm empty.   I'm going to go get another.   I think I hear Ramone wrapping up, let's get back to the girls.  Class, this is my old friend Richard.  Richard and I used to be in this very same classroom together.   We even had your old teacher, Mr. Megher.  That's not a nice thing to say, Patrick. The BELL RINGS.   One girl gets up.   Gertrude eyeballs her.  Marcia?  OK, everyone is excused for recess. All the kids pop up and head to the door.   Mrs. Whiting directs traffic outside.   Richard makes his way to Gertrude.  It's still not a nice thing to say.   And actually, Mr. Megher smelled like wet dog and...  ...Matanuska Thunderfuck.   But let's keep that between us.  That was your fault.  You tried to kiss me.   A girl has to defend herself.  No Top Gun.   Please.  No.   You loved your Top Gun.   I just smiled and laughed like a good girlfriend.     No.   Nothing's wrong.  I wish there was a better way to say this.  I made a huge mistake.   With you.   Breaking up with you.   I'm sorry.  Yes.  This is something big.  I think...  I want you back.   Oh God, he's making me say it again.  I want you back.   Like... we should be together.   All the time.  I know this isn't the best time to bring this up.  I'm not talking about dating!   You should move back here.   We can have the life you always talked about in High School.   I'm ready for that now.  I know that the timing here sucks.   But we are meant to be together.   I know it.   I think you know it too...  Oh.   Hey Margaret.  Yeah.   See you at the wedding.  Promise. Margaret walks back into the house.   Alone.  So here's the deal.   I'm going to have a million questions for you tomorrow... Gertrude sits down next to Richard.     102.  ...but for now I thought we'd just sit here and drink beer.   OK? Richard nods.   Gertrude hands him a beer.  You have been practicing.  Well.   Margaret told me that you, uh, turned into bit of a man whore down there. Richard looks down.   A bit ashamed.   Gertrude makes light.  You're gonna have to put that in check if you move back.   Cause me and Beth Cable are the only two real options up here... and I'll kick that bitch's ass. Richard gives her a polite smile.   He's not really in the mood to joke.   Gertrude notices.  So no jokes yet?   Too soon?  That kiss didn't seem \"confused.\" Richard takes a beat to collect himself.  I don't know.  Find out what?  Well.   OK then.   What's a girl gonna do?  I guess you want who you want. Gertrude gives a melancholy smile.  Uh-huh. Richard gets up.  I'm fine.   Really.   Go. Gertrude nods her approval and Richard runs off to the party.     104.",
        "Margaret": "I knew you would call!   Now come on, tell me what I want to hear.   Give it to me.  You should get paid extra for being so darn funny. Margaret straightens her jacket, answers the phone, and walks out the door.  This is Margaret.  You've been thinking about our talk because I'm right.   Everyone does publicity.   Roth, McCourt, Russo.   Hell, Chabon practically whores himself.   Know what they have in common?   A Pulitzer.  Yes, I know you haven't done it in twenty years, but that's how long it's been since you've written a book this good.  I'm not pushing so you'll sell more books, I'm pushing because it'll be a crime if the world doesn't hear that you wrote a genius piece of literature.   Do the publicity. Margaret waits for an answer and smiles when she hears \"yes.\"  You're making the right decision!   Great news.   Going into an elevator, think I'm going to lose you... Margaret hangs up.   Never give them a chance to change their mind.        Cancel the call, move the meeting to eight,      6.   I got Frank to do publicity.  When I want your praise, I'll ask for it. Is Bob here?  We're going to his office.   Grab your pad. Richard calmly backs out of the office...  That's cute.   You gonna call her today?  Are you bored here?   Do you need little distractions like that to get you through the day?  You have another late night out?  I'm firing on all cylinders and you've got hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head, and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday.  You'll magically unwrinkle?  You have magic pants?  Does this work on more than just your pants?  Buy me some.  I don't care what or who you do on your own time, but when you walk through that door you represent me, and I will not have your personal life affect you at work.   If you want me to think of promoting you to editor, I need you sharp, focused and professional. Got it?  Great.   Now you're just a prop in here, so don't say a word.     8.  Hey, Bob.  I'm lettin' you go, Bob.  You're fired.  This isn't working out.  I asked you repeatedly to get Frank to do publicity.   You said it was impossible.  I just talked to him.   He's in.  No more buts, Bob.   I've been chief for a month and a half, and this is the third time you've dropped the ball.   You didn't even call to ask him.  All you had to do to was pick up the phone. That's it.   Now I'll give you two months to find a new job, and then you can say you resigned.   I won't tell a soul, my lips are sealed. Margaret nods at Richard and he opens the door.  What's he doing? Richard turns around and takes a peek.   Bob gets out of his chair and comes to his door.  Oh Bob, don't do it...  What are you doing?   I gave you a civilized way out of this.  Oh, Bob.   You could never threaten me.   I'm firing you because you're lazy, entitled and incompetent.   I'm firing you because you don't work hard.   So if you know what's good for you, you'll shut up, take off that ridiculous bow tie, find a bar and get drunk.   Because if you say one more word, Richard here is going to call security and have you thrown out on your ass.   Are we perfectly clear? Bob nods.  Good.   Now I've got work to do, so if you'll     10. Margaret and Richard walk away and speak in hushed tones.  We need to call his authors and explain what happened.   And get Frank's publicity schedule figured out pronto.  I gave you the weekend off?  She tell you to quit?  Who is this guy?  Go get him.   But he's out of here in five minutes, we've got work to do. Margaret leaves and goes into her office.     Yeah.   Well, those announcements are silly, aren't they?   Like everyone who needs to know doesn't know already. Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man, but now gives up.  Have to admit, I can't place where we know each other from. Gilbertson smiles.   He didn't expect her to remember.  Don't have it...  Oh my God, you read that manuscript with me? That book is legend.   Without a doubt the worst ever written.  It was a fever dream!                                         900 offensive and pointless pages, with like 30 characters, who all had some weird disability.   The paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering scientist?   Oh!   And there was the asthmatic alien chapter -- written entirely in his alien language.  Did you see the pass letter I wrote him?  You wrote the book.  You're Dante Dickens?  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.   You obviously were spending a lot of time writing, I just thought you should channel all that passion into something else. Gilbertson smiles as he pulls a BADGE from his coat pocket.     13.  Excuse me?   What?   This is a mistake.   I've lived here since 1981.   I'm applying for citizenship.  Yes.   And all the papers are in. Gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down.  I'm a threat to the sovereignty of the United States?  \"Affect me at work?\"   I'll lose my job!  Oh, no.   No, no, no.   I won't do it.         Well then, get it published at another house.  All?  I'll be fired and laughed out of the industry if I publish that book.  I will never publish your book.   Ever.  This is blackmail.   I'll go to your boss.  Know what, Dante?   I'm not going anywhere! We're getting married! Richard has no idea what Margaret is talking about.  We are!  Stop playing around, honey. Margaret is all smiles.   Richard is very confused.  Mr. Gilbertson is from the INS.   I told him about us.   About us getting married.   We're in love.   We tried to fight it.   When it's right, it's right.  Nope.   True love.   Got it bad.  Of course we are.  What?  C'mon.   Answer.   You don't have a choice. Richard doesn't want to do this, but relents.  Are we done here?  No one.   With us working together we decided it would be too much of a scandal if anyone knew.     We're telling his family this weekend.  Yes.   We are.   We're surprising them...  ...at his Grandma's 90th birthday party.     18.   At Richard's parent's house.   In his hometown.  Why don't you tell him?   Yes.   Of course we're going to Alaska. That's where Richard is from. Gilbertson begins to walk around.   He's getting worked up.  I'm sorry, Dante.   Did you not prepare for that? Margaret puts her arm around Richard and waits in silence.     19. Enraged, but with no recourse for now, Gilbertson checks his appointment book and writes down some information.  There are no \"T's\" or \"I's\" in \"Love\" Mr. Gilbertson. Gilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard.   Margaret goes back to her desk like this is all in a days work.  Why are you from Alaska?   Sweet Jesus, that's inconvenient.   So here's what's going to happen.   We'll play boyfriend and girlfriend this weekend for your parents and that should be enough for this INS interview. Richard doesn't react.   Margaret doesn't notice.  So you need to figure out the travel, schedule a justice of the peace for next week, and get my lawyer on the phone. Margaret takes a sip of her coffee and makes a face.  But first, run down and get me another coffee from your girlfriend, this is cold. Margaret holds out her coffee cup.   Richard doesn't move.  Hello?   Richard?   Richard! Richard says his first words since Gilbertson left.  Richard, come back here. Margaret tries not to make a scene.  Richard.   Richard. Richard pushes the elevator button in front of reception.  Come back to the office! Richard can't take it.   He gets up in Margaret's face.  Well, we need to talk.  Well I'd rather poke my eyes out than play pretend girlfriend, but this is the big time.   Sometimes you need to sack up.  You wanna be an editor?   You need to make     21.  I'm doing what?  You work for me!  Look, I came to this town alone and with nothing.   I've worked my ass off for fifteen years and this guy wants to ruin me because he wrote the shittiest book of all time?   No way.  Fine.   You take me to Alaska this weekend, and I'll make you editor.   Deal? Margaret puts out her hand to shake, Richard takes it.  And I'm not sleeping on your parent's hide-a- bed, we're staying in a hotel.   Do they even have hotels in Alaska?  Are you done with the press release?     So what do I need to know up there?   Bullet points.     I'm sorry, I hate it when people stare at what I'm reading.   It's just... I worked on that book.  Edited it.   It was one of my favorites.  You don't see many guys with that book. You, uh, read a lot of love stories about Roman concubines?          There you are.   Give me my lap top. Richard untangles the bags and gives Margaret her computer bag.  I know, Richard. Richard turns around and puts the bags in the overhead compartment.   The Handsome Man turns to Margaret.  Sit together with who? The Handsome man nods at Richard.  You mean him? The Handsome man nods.   Margaret tries to set the record straight.  No.   No.   No.   He's my assistant.  Well, he's... indispensable.     25. The Handsome man isn't buying it.  And gay.   Takes care of me everywhere I go. Call him my queen mother.   Aren't you my indispensable gay queen mother? Margaret shoots Richard a nasty look.   He has to go along.  I have to go now.  Have a great life. Margaret walks toward the group.   Richard puts out his hand and silently pleads for Margaret to hold it.   At the last second, she takes it.  Me neither. Debbie picks up some of the bags and starts walking toward the exit.   Everyone else follows her lead.   Uh, is everyone coming to our hotel?  Surprise?   Another surprise?  I'm really not good with surprises.  What?                                                              What?  Are you witches?     I'm a lucky woman. Margaret does her best to smile.  I'm not getting out of this car until you tell me where we're going.  Who are you people? Richard lets Margaret wonder.  I thought it was the dragon lady?  Uh huh.     32. Out of nowhere, a small HUSKY PUPPY startles Margaret and jumps on her.  What a great name.   Balzac's \"Lost Illusions\" is one of my favorite novels.     Thank you.   Where's Richard's room?  Oh, let's not upset Grandma Annie.  Great.   You know, I've gotten used to his breathing at night.  I'm about 15 seconds from bitch.  What is going on here?  You had no idea they knew about us getting married?  Well, we just gotta tell âem.  Tell âem the truth.   About us.     34.  What do you mean no way?   This is crazy.  Well I don't like this.  Selfish?  How is it selfish to tell the truth?  Fine.   But if we do this, you need to stop lying to me.  Why did you tell me that you were poor?  Well, you never told me you were rich.  I don't know, how about, \"Hi, my name is Richard, I'm an Alaskan titan of industry.\"  No I wouldn't.  I'm not anti-rich.  I earned...  Hey.   Watch it.   You're still my assistant.  Sure of that?  Well, come on.   If we're going to do this, we might as well put on a show.  I went to Union college in upstate New York. It's a small liberal arts school that no one has ever heard of. Richard comes to the group and hands Margaret a drink.   Lime?  Since I graduated college. Richard comes back with the lime.   Margaret takes it and doesn't say thank you.  Oh, who's counting... Geoffrey could let it go, but wants to push her.  Well, let me see.   That would be sixteen or seventeen years.   Exactly.     37.  Just turned thirty seven.   Born on May 20th. I'm a Taurus. Geoffrey and Margaret give each other a smile.   I need some protein.  Thank you, honey.   You're being so sweet. Richard is surprised, but remembers they're a couple.  I'm editor in chief, now. Richard tenderly puts his arm around Margaret.  You're a Gertrude?  I'm sure it's been a curse.  Not exactly...  Can I tell this one, honey?     40.  I'm an early, early riser and go for a run everyday.   Well, it was our six month anniversary and I was out for my normal jog in the park, when who do I see in a horse drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting for me halfway through my run?   Richard!   So I ran up to the carriage and asked him what was going on, and he put his finger to his lips and says, \"shhhh.\"   So there I am in my jogging clothes, next to the most handsome mute in the world - have you seen him in a tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and smiling ear to ear.   Couple minutes later, we arrive at Tavern on the Green.   Best part, we're the only people in the place because Richard got them to open up early. Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just as the sun starts to peek above the trees, this beautiful man gets down on one knee, and says \"I didn't want one more sunrise to go by without you knowing that you are the light of my life, and that I would be the luckiest man in the world if you would be my wife.   Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry me?\" The group is silent, waiting for the clincher.  I said yes. The group gives a collective \"ahh\".   Grandma Annie takes both Margaret and Richard by the hand.  Oh please.   I'd wonder too.   Honestly, my lawyers have been dealing with all of this. When you told us at the airport it was the first time I'd heard about it.   I'm so embarrassed.  Excuse me, I'll just be a second. Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that lead to the backyard.   She leaves the door open, and doesn't notice Balzac follow her outside.  Don't be a cliche, Frank.   Don't be the wishy washy writer who changes his mind every two seconds. Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him.   The dog starts YAPPING to get attention.   She walks away, but Balzac continues barking. Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear.   Sit and be quiet! Balzac sits and pouts.   Margaret walks away and puts the phone back to her ear.     42.  I fired Bob because he didn't have your best interest in mind.   Our job is to help you succeed.   He wasn't doing that. Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she notices an EAGLE soaring in circles above her and Balzac.   Not sure what to think, she looks back at Balzac and sees him peacefully sit in the grass. She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone.   Margaret shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when -- WHOOSH!   The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and takes off.   Margaret jumps. There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle. She stays calm on the phone.  Could you hold on just a second? With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the eagle suspended 20 feet above her.   The eagle drops Balzac and Margaret catches him.   Balzac looks frightened. Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone and picks it up.    Frank, I don't want to sell you on anything. But know this.   This book is your legacy... Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac again.   She runs.  ... and-I-think-you-should-be-the-one-to introduce-your-legacy-to-the-world. Call me- tomorrow-with-your-decision.   My-phone is- always-on.   Talk-to-you-soon. The eagle bears down on them with talons out.   Just as the eagle is about to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone to fend back the eagle.   To her surprise, the eagle grabs Margaret's phone and flies off.   Margaret freaks.        Take the dog!   Take the dog!  This is a delicious dog, Mr. Eagle.   C'mon, bring back the phone. Richard calls out from the house.  The eagle took my phone!  Your dad was right!   The eagle tried to take the dog, so I saved it, then it came back and took my phone.     44.  Frank's going to call me on that phone.   I need it!  Oh.  I'm not going anywhere.  Definitely not a salmon. The women encourage Hank on as he moves Margaret's hands to his wiggling ass and gives her a feel.   She can't help but give and embarrassed smile.   Finally, the song ends and Hank goes into the splits.   Thrilled, the room gives him a standing ovation. Margaret plays along and gives Hank a kiss on the cheek.   She begins to get off the stage, but Hank takes her by the hand.     45.  What's going on?  What's that smell? Margaret finally takes off her blindfold, and finds Ramone about an inch away from her face.   Ahhh!!! Margaret falls out of her chair and her scream frightens Ramone. After the initial scare he composes himself and wags his finger at her naughty behavior.  Good lord.  Want me to do it?  What?   I'm just working on my tan.  It's been a long day. Margaret looks inside and sees that the party is still raging.         Chicago, right?  And now you're back?  Really?   I don't know.   Don't you miss...  For you to get divorced?  Are we talking about the same guy?  Well, Richard's such a player. Gertrude looks confused.  I mean he was a total player.   Before we started dating.   Six months ago.  That surprises you?  We don't really talk much about stuff like that.  No, no.   Please.   I mean, we are getting married.   I want to know these things. Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed.  I'm sorry.   I didn't mean to...   He proposed to you in high school?  You must have...  I would hope so.  I'll be right in. Margaret smiles and turns to the ocean.   Gertrude goes inside. Then, to herself, Margaret silently whispers.  We are awful people.  I am so tired. Balzac GROWLS when he hears Margaret's voice.   He's still mad. Margaret just smiles.  Think I'm going to take a shower and clean off Ramone's bubble gum body oil. Thanks for a great night. Annie and Debbie smile graciously and wish her good night.   Once she's gone, they turn their death stare back to Geoffrey.   He looks genuinely unnerved.        Richard, is that you?  Richard, are you... Then out of nowhere, Balzac  startles Margaret.  I'm sorry bout the eagle.   But I saved you. Balzac won't listen to reason and barks angrily.   Margaret grabs the ceramic top of the toilet tank to protect herself.  Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                        Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The two quickly separate and spastically try to cover up.   A rapid fire back and forth ensues.  Why are you naked?                                                   Why are you wet?  Don't look at me!                                                    You tackled me!  It was the dog!                                                      You're blaming the dog again?  Will you just hand me a towel! Richard looks for a towel, but forgets he's naked.   When he looks under the bed, Margaret shrieks and covers her eyes..  You're flashing brain! Richard quickly changes positions.   Out of desperation, he pulls the entire comforter off the bed.   He throws it Margaret's way, and she wraps herself in it.     56.  You can cover up any time! Richard cups the beans and franks and backs up to his clothes by the window.  Explain yourself!  You didn't hear me?  I didn't jump you.  I didn't mean to jump you.   I didn't know you were here.  I was running from the dog! Richard looks at Margaret suspiciously.  Oh please!   Don't flatter yourself.  Go take a shower.   You stink.  I'm never gonna to get to sleep. Richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down outside the window.   The sunlight is instantly blocked out and the room is pitch black.  Oh.   Well.   Thanks. Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed.   The two silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling.  Can we not talk about this?  It wasn't weird.  Because we're... like teammates.  We are teammates.   And teammates see each other naked in the locker room.   All the time.   It's not a big deal.  Good night, Richard. The two lay awake in silence for another beat.  Yes?  Okay...  Get some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow.     Who is it?     59.        You don't have to go to all this trouble. Really. Debbie sweetly looks back at Margaret.     You just take all this for granted?   Your family, this house... Richard takes another big bite and turns to Margaret.  Why are you doing this to them?  Why am I here?   You didn't have to bring me here.  I didn't make you do anything.   You could of said no.  I get why a not rich person would do this. But you've got everything.   It doesn't make any sense.  I wish it wasn't my business.   But unfortunately, it has become my business, because I made a deal with someone I thought I could trust. Richard stares at Margaret for a beat.   He's exasperated.  Fine.  I'll be ready in 20 minutes. Margaret angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it down on the plate.   She goes to her suitcase and looks for clothes.   A beat passes, and she comes back to the rolls.  These are really good. She takes a cinnamon roll and leaves.  That's great to hear.  But I don't...  Is this really necessary?  Why is he handcuffed to the machine?  Nice. From the decapitator, fish are fed into the gut puller, where their bellies are slit and the intestines are pulled out.  You know, I shouldn't be here.   I was a vegetarian for six months in college. Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime line, where a long line of 20 workers give the fish a final cleaning before they are frozen.   With great speed, they take the fish from the gut puller line and clean out all the left over intestines.  Gimme that. Up to the challenge, she takes the knife and grabs a fish. Margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much distance as possible between her and the salmon.  Is that why you're still pissed at him?   You loved this?     I wasn't gonna forget. Margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on its way, and grabs another fish with more confidence.  What kind of things changed?   You mean, like, Gertrude?     The creepy teenage proposal?  You were a freak by the way.  And she was right to break up with you.  For a little while?   Don't sell yourself short.  So you moved to the open arms of New York City?  With scheduling my pilates?   ...To Kill a Mockingbird.   It's all about To Kill a Mockingbird.  So we're \"getting married\" so you can give daddy the finger?     67.     Oh yeah, we're good.   By the way, you're more screwed up than I am, Paxton.  One more question...  That wasn't my question.  Can we stop gutting fish?   I need my phone.    You know him?  Of course he was.   How many people are on this island? They start to fill their cart with cases of champagne.  Feels smaller. With the cart full they head to the checkout.  Why's Ramone letting you steal his stuff?  That must have been handy in High School.  Should you leave the cart?  I've come to realize that being my assistant gave you more access to my life than I ever imagined, but there are a few things you don't know about me.   I told you never to talk about that.   Did you know I took disco lessons in the sixth grade?  The Y.  Uh, my first concert was Kool and the Gang.  I won tickets on the radio and saw them at the fair.  You know.  Cherish the love we have, we should cherish the life we live... Richard shakes his head.  Well they were good.  I really like \"The O.C.\".   Not fake, ha, ha isn't it funny I like this trash.   I really like it.  Allergic to pine nuts.  Afraid of penguins.  Haven't slept with a man in a year and a half.  Kool and the Gang gets nothing, but that gets a Holy shit?   I've been busy!  That hurts coming from Mr. Magic Pants.  Yeah, well, I'm not good at that.  No, not that.   I'm great at that.   Aces. Top notch.  Yes.   You will.  I need a computer and the internet.   Now.  No, no, no.   I need on now.   I've got a Booker prize winning author demanding I send him an e-mail in the next forty five minutes explaining why he should stay with a publishing house that \"makes\" him do publicity. The Pirate looks at Margaret like she's speaking Chinese.  Listen to me asshole... The Pirate looks around to make sure his boss can't hear.  I didn't know there were a lot of pirates in Alaska!  I'm sorry, but could I have a minute alone     73.              Hey guys. Holy shit.   Did Margaret hear anything?   Her face gives nothing away.   Gertrude and Richard act like nothing just happened, but look guilty as hell.  Yeah.   We'll see what he says.  You ready to get back to the house?  Well let's go.   See you at the wedding, Gertrude. Gertrude just smiles.  So, what did you and Gertrude talk about? Richard lies.  That was it?   I was gone for awhile...  I was going to go for a run first, it's been three days since I got out, I'm feeling crazy.  What now? Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT.   She soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a SHAMAN dancing around it.   He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a carved bear's head mask and tribal make up.   His belly shakes as he spastically moves around the fire. The Shaman sings a song that sounds centuries old.  What, ah, are you doing?  Ya know, I've got to get back.  I'm a big fan of the nest. Geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher.  OK, OK.   I \"accept your circle.\" Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire.  I'm gonna head back.  I think I am. Margaret begins to leave.   Geoffrey calls after her.  Me what?  Chant what?  I can't...  I don't know any chants!    ...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...        ...to the wall... More sand.   More fire.  ...to sweat drop down my balls... Geoffrey stops dancing.   What did she say?  ...to all these bitches crawl... Margaret's eyes are closed, she doesn't realize that she's broken out into a âLil John song.   She continues to dance.  ...To all skee skee motherfucker... Geoffrey takes the bear head mask off.  ...all skee skee got damn... From the trees, the moment is broken when Debbie shouts out.  He told me I had to chant!  Just buttoning up here.  Yeah, it's a little snug.     It's beautiful.  How'd they stay together?  No, no, no.   I can't.   Really.  Well.   Thing is... Margaret deliberates spilling her guts to Annie, but can't.  ...the dress is just a little tight.  We need to talk.  Well I'm freaking out.   I need to get away from here.   From everyone.   Now.  No!   I did that.   It did not help.   We're not going to need any of this if I don't get out of here.  Move over, I'm driving. Margaret cuts in front of Richard and grabs the wheel.  It doesn't matter.  Where are we?  I'm fine.  Yeah.   I'm a control freak.   Fine.  This coming from the sociopath.  I'd never bring me here.  I mean to Alaska.  You're sick.   Doing this to them.  They love you.   Do you get that?  And you're still willing to lie to them?  Didn't know what?  I didn't know!  You think I'm stupid?     What it was like!  To have a family!   I forgot what it was like to have a family.   I've been on my own since I was thirteen, and I'd forgot what it was like to have people that love you, and make you breakfast, and give you necklaces...     89. Suddenly, Margaret has a hard time speaking and is short of breath.   She goes to the side of the speed boat.  I'm going to take a walk.  Alone.   I need alone time.  I'm, uh, about to lose my shit.   Big time. I need a second.    I'm going to be over there.   Away from you. Just sit down, turn around, and act like you're not here. Richard goes to speak, but Margaret motions for him to sit down and turn around.   He does.   Margaret gets off the boat and walks away from him on the glacier.   You can do this.   Couple more hours, and then you'll never see these people again. Eventually you'll write a letter. Apologize.   Send the necklace back.  No talking!     90.  Again, you're not supposed to be... Margaret doesn't finish her sentence.    Oh, thank God! Richard tries to control himself, but BURSTS OUT LAUGHING. Margaret is really scared.  Wh-, wh-, why are you laughing?  Don't do that.     91.  The thing that doctors do in E.R. when they tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to death that they're going to be OK.   Don't do that!  Uh-huh. Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now.   He's checking the ice to see if it is stable.   He slowly walks her way.  I'm really cold.    You said it was \"no biggie\".  Yeah.   I'm fine. Richard smiles.   Margaret smiles back. Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms.   She fits just right.   Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully.     Yeah.   While I was getting my camera. The two stare at each other for a beat.   There's a real spark. They might kiss.  And?  Yeah.   I was.  Put me down. Richard puts Margaret down near the boat.   She tries to regain her composure.  You wanna call it off?     93.  Fine.   It's over.   We'll tell them when we get back.  It's fine.  It's OK.   Tell him.  He's only doing it because he loves you.  Just stop.   Think about this.     Matches the shoes. Margaret pulls up the dress to reveal running sneakers.   Nice song. Richard shrugs his shoulders.  I guess so. Margaret and Annie stop at the end of the aisle.   Looking up, Margaret sees the justice of the peace, Ramone.                      (Yes, the same guy from the liquor store and the strip club.     Oh, you bet. They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits.  Ramone.  No.  I have something to say.   It's not a question though.  Uh.   Um.   No.  Hey there, folks.   Thanks for coming out. I've got a little announcement to make about the \"wedding.\"  Not sure the best way to tell you all this. But, uh... I made Richard marry me.   This is all a sham. Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air.     99.  I was going to get kicked out of the country -- so I told Richard that I would destroy his career if he didn't marry me.  Richard.   Please.   Let me finish.  Richard wanted to stop this when we got off the plane, but I wouldn't let him.   Don't blame him.   This is all my fault.  Could you get the band started?   And give these people something to drink.  And you.   Meet me at your dingy in ten, you're taking me to the airport.  Take care of him.      Uh-huh.   Yeah.   That's great Frank.   Good news.   Talk to you on Monday. Margaret hangs up.  Yup.   He's in.   For now.     100.  Yeah.   Right. Margaret starts collecting her bags.  Thanks.   Fun weekend.  Wasn't sure if your mom would want me to strip the sheets, so I just left them.  It was getting too messy.   We weren't going to be able to keep it up.  I heard you and Gertrude at the school.   I think she meant what she said.   She's a great girl, you should stay.   It's the right thing.   You're perfect for each other.  Don't worry about me.   I'll survive.  Yup.   This is it.     101. Margaret walks to the door, but stops.   She turns to Richard. Despite her best effort to act cold, she can't help herself.    Goodbye, Richard.  I'm not doing great in the dignity department, can we not do this right now?  I'll publish your book. Gilbertson smiles.  Yes, of course. She unbuckles her seat belt, about to get out of her seat.  Tell him I'm not here.  Oh, good lord.   What the hell are you doing? Everyone in the tower smiles.   They're making progress.  About what?  As boss and assistant.     Is that the best you got? Geoffrey hits Richard, as if to say \"see, that's what I said.\" Richard composes himself.  What's your point?  This wasn't supposed to happen. Richard looks Margaret in the eye.  I'm not the kind of girl who gets saved. Richard smiles, and without warning, Margaret grabs him, and plants a long, deep, and wet kiss on him. The long kiss is interrupted by the Handsome Man and Gilbertson.   Hey!   Do you think getting arrested might affect you at work? Gilbertson has no retort.     115.  Oh, and I'm not going to be able to publish your book after all.    I've got some explaining to do. Margaret and Richard walk down the steps and stand in front of Richard's family.   Hi.   I'm Margaret.   I've known your son for years, but we've just recently begun to see each other romantically.  I want to get to know you all, and spend some real time up here in Alaska.  I'm not sure when you are going to see him get married, but I promise as long as I'm with him, he'll be happy. Passengers cram up to the plane windows to see what will happen.",
        "Tate": "",
        "Gilbertson": "Margaret.   Good to see you.   I know how busy you are.   Congrats on the promotion.   Read about it in P-W.  Three years ago?   We worked together.  Remember \"Dandelion's Desire?\" Margaret gets excited.     12.  You think?  I believe there was a glossary... Margaret laughs, caught up in the memory.     I did.  One of my nom de plumes. Gilbertson paces.   Margaret stays seated, at a loss.  Ms. Mills, I'm with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and I'm deporting you to Canada.  You need citizenship now?   After the big promotion?  Well, my office is going to reject your paperwork on Monday, while we investigate whether your behavior is well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.   We must protect our sovereignty.  Yes, and unfortunately my investigation will take awhile, so you'll be deported while your case winds through the system.  Will it affect you at work if you aren't allowed to enter the U.S. for the next two to three years?   Ahhhh.   That's a shame.   Too bad we can't work something out. Margaret stops looking at her file.   It all becomes clear.  Do what, Ms. Mills?  I've edited it down.   It's better.  They all just don't get me.  Well not all.   Two hundred fifty, two hundred sixty-one.   Ish.  I'm at the end of my rope, Ms. Mills.   I'm an author.   Not some bureaucrat who brings a lunchable to work everyday and lives in his brother's garage.   You're the last stop, and I'm desperate.  There's no need to make this difficult.   I don't turn in your file until Monday...  I've spent two years preparing for this day. Don't you think I've thought of that? Now Margaret is pacing, while Gilbertson happily looks on. Suddenly, the door opens and Richard bursts in, acting like there is an \"emergency\" so Margaret can end the meeting.  You are marrying your male secretary?  You are marrying your male assistant?  And this has nothing to do with my visit here today?   You.   Is this true?   Are you marrying this... woman? Margaret comes over to Richard and holds his hand.         Five years in prison and a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine.  If I prove you're lying, you go to federal prison for five years. Gilbertson takes out a pad and takes notes.   You.   Do you know what you're getting yourself into?   We're going to put you in a room and ask you every detail that a real couple would know about each other.   Do you even know her favorite color? Richard doesn't answer.   Margaret encourages him on with a thinly veiled threat.  You mean purple?  Favorite flower?  Childhood pet name?  Who knows you're getting married? Margaret interrupts.  Have you at least told your family?  How convenient.   So you're not telling anyone that you are getting married?  Pathetic.   Four questions and I've got enough to send you to prison...  And where's that going to be?  And where's that located?  Is that on Long Island? Only Richard has the answer.   Margaret tries to cover.  You're going to Alaska this weekend?  You think you can beat me with this B-S story?   Forcing your secretary...  ...assistant to marry you and then conveniently telling his family for the first time this weekend?  The INS will see you both in ten days for your official interview.   Your stories better match up on every account. Mr. Gilbertson gets right up in Margaret's face as he gives her the piece of paper.  Cross all your T's and dot your I's with this ruse, Ms. Mills.  Hey there kids.   Good to see ya!     94.   We made a deal and dad here flew me up.   Now you tell the truth, and get off scott free. It's like it never happened for you.  Oh quack, quack, quack.   Just tell me what really happened, and I'll be on my way.   No one gets hurt, we all get what we want. Margaret takes Richard's hand.  You got it! Margaret nods, hands Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks back up the aisle with all eyes on her.   She stops when she gets to Gertrude and leans down.  I want you to say the words.  Say it. Margaret closes her eyes.   Hating that it's come to this.  Now was that so hard?  ...I want my book launch to be special.   I'm thinking we throw a soiree at the Nevsky Monastery.   In St. Petersberg? Margaret stares at him blankly.   Where Dostoyevsky is buried?   Hello?   I thought you were a professional... Margaret closes her eyes to numb the pain.     108.  ...so next topic.   Celebrities.   Let's invite the Bill Clinton's and leave out the Paris Hilton's, OK? Gilbertson smiles as he looks out the window and sees the plane leave Sitka.     109.  ...you know those two hundred pages I took out?   I'm going to put them back... A flight attendant comes to Margaret and interrupts.  What's this about?     110.  Are you thinking about going back to him? Margaret doesn't answer.  We have a deal!   You can't back out now! The flight attendant steps in, annoyed that Gilbertson is trying to break up Richard and Margaret.  I will do no such thing.  Who said that?  Listen sweetheart...  I'm a federal officer, so why don't you get me another cocktail and mind your own... BUZZ! ZAP!                                                            400,000 Volts of electricity surge through Gilbertson.   He twitches violently and crashes to the floor. Behind him, The Handsome Man holds a stun gun and a badge.  So you are getting married this weekend?",

It's not like he hasn't told her that he used to call her the Dragon Lady.   They're getting married.  Oh, we cancelled your reservation.   You're part of the family now.     Family doesn't stay at a hotel.   Also, we've got another little surprise for you two.  ...you're getting married this weekend!  The whole kit and caboodle. Margaret gives both these women a look that says \"what are you talking about?\"         ...or friends...  Engagement party tonight...  Just quaint.   During the solstice it's good luck.   It's an Alaskan thing.  I'm old, Margaret.   I don't have much time left.   Richard lives so far away, and I never see him.   Now I find out he's getting married, and I have a chance to see my one grandchild's wedding day.   It's a dream come true for me.   A dream come true.   Please let me see Richard get married before I die. Please. Long beat.   Richard doesn't know what Margaret is going to say. Margaret doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.   Finally, she goes to speak, but can only get out... two big thumbs up. The crowd cheers.  To tell you the truth, we had a lot of the plans made already for my birthday.   Just a few changes here and there, and we made this weekend a wedding. Margaret stares at Richard.  Help him with the bags Geoffrey.  Let's get you two settled. As Richard and Margaret move towards the house, Annie shoots Geoffrey a look that says \"be nice\".  Now Richard, what I want to know is how you proposed. This grabs the group's full attention.   Everyone loves to hear a story like this.  You are a good boy Richard, and you make me very proud.   I love you Richy.  Just sit there dear.  Ramone was the only male dancer on the island for years. No one has the heart to tell him to hang it up.  Thank you dear, but let's keep it our secret.     46.  Is she singing about balls?  Oh, you poor dear.   Geoffrey, you can't do this!  He's an eighth Tlingit, dear.  This was my dress from 1929.   My mother made it by hand.   Amazing how things come back into style.   How does it fit? Margaret speaks through the door.  Drum roll! Grandma and Debbie enthusiastically make drum roll sounds. Margaret opens the door and smiles.   She's unsure of herself, but looks fantastic.   The dress fits great, except...  Your boobs are bigger than mine ever were.  Debbie, please.   We've got work to do.  You go work downstairs, I'll finish this. Debbie tries to calm down, but can't.  Go! Debbie nods in agreement.   Smiling from ear to ear, she leaves in tears.   Margaret and Annie watch her go.  Had to get rid of her before I gave you this.   Don't think she woulda recovered. Grandma Annie comes from behind and puts her arms around Margaret's neck.   When she is done, a stunning blue necklace lays on Margaret's neck.  You needed something blue.   It's silly, but I didn't want to take any chances.  It's hematite.   Alaska diamonds.   The blue ones like this are very rare.   My great grandfather gave it to my great grandmother when they were married.   They were quite a scandal, you know.   He was Russian and she was Tlingit.      85.  Back then, you had to get approval from every person in the tribe before you got married.   It almost broke them up.  Don't know.   But I'm sure happy they did, none of us would be here if they hadn't. Grandma and Margaret admire the necklace in the mirror.  I want you to have it. This is awful news for Margaret.   She might as well be stealing from Annie.  I don't want to hear it.   It's yours. Grandmothers like to give their stuff away to their grandchildren.   Makes us feel like we'll always be a part of your life, even after we're gone. Take it. Margaret puts her hand to the necklace, and for the first time feels like a complete and total fraud.  Are you feeling all right, dear? Margaret doesn't speak.   Annie patiently waits for her reply.  Oh, don't worry about that.   We've got these seams by the arm, this'll be easy. Annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk.  We can fix this no problem. Margaret smiles, but knows that Annie couldn't be more wrong.     86.  If I were one to brag, I'd say that dress is perfect.  Those'll be your best friend.   Wedding shoes stink.   You ready?  Is that your song, dear?  It's me, Ramone. Margaret gives Annie a kiss, and then turns to Richard.   They whisper while they walk up to Ramone.  That's all we ever wanted. Grandma Annie gives Margaret and Richard a big hug.   Debbie joins in.   Then Geoffrey.   Passengers cheer.",

Are you feeling all right, dear? Margaret doesn't speak.   Annie patiently waits for her reply.  Oh, don't worry about that.   We've got these seams by the arm, this'll be easy. Annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk.  We can fix this no problem. Margaret smiles, but knows that Annie couldn't be more wrong.     86.  If I were one to brag, I'd say that dress is perfect.  Those'll be your best friend.   Wedding shoes stink.   You ready?  Is that your song, dear?  It's me, Ramone. Margaret gives Annie a kiss, and then turns to Richard.   They whisper while they walk up to Ramone.  Boys!   Stop it! Stop it!   Stop it! But suddenly, a look of panic flashes across Annie's face.   She grabs the table to steady herself, but pulls the table cloth, causing a loud crash.   Geoffrey and Richard run over.  I'm having a... I need to go to the hospital.   Fast.     106.  Listen to me.   You two need to stop fighting.   You'll never see eye to eye, but you're family.   If this doesn't stop, one day you'll regret it.  Promise me you'll stand by Richard, even if you don't agree with him.  And Richard.   Promise you'll work harder to be a part of this family.  OK, then. Annie closes her eyes.   She looks peaceful.   A moment passes.     107. Then suddenly Annie takes off her mask, sits up, and yells to th pilot.   I'm feeling much better.   I don't need to go to the hospital.   Take us to the airport, please. Richard and Geoffrey are confused.   Stunned even.  We didn't have time for your squabbling, and I knew a helicopter would be the quickest way to the airport.   It seemed like the best way.  And remember, you two promised me that you're going get along.   I wasn't kidding about that.   Larry Ferris!   Don't make me call your mother!  That's all we ever wanted. Grandma Annie gives Margaret and Richard a big hug.   Debbie joins in.   Then Geoffrey.   Passengers cheer."

    "description": "For three years, Andrew Paxton has slaved as the assistant to Margaret Tate, hard-driving editor at a New York publisher. When Margaret, a Canadian, faces deportation for an expired visa, she hatches a scheme to marry Andrew, and he agrees if she will promise him a promotion. A skeptical INS agent vows to test the couple about each other the next Monday. Andrew had plans to fly home that weekend for his grandma's 90th, so Margaret goes with him--to Sitka, Alaska, where Mom, Dad, and Grandma await. Family dynamics take over: tensions between Andrew and his dad, an ex-girlfriend, Andrew's dislike of Margaret, and Margaret's past color the next few days, with the INS ready to charge Andrew with fraud.—<jhailey@hotmail.com>",
