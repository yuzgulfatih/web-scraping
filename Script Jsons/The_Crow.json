        "Grange": "Lao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods affirmatively.   You gonna smoke his bones now, or however it is you do it?  Lao smiles indulgently.  He wipes the blood from the blade on the jacket of his ex-lord.  Lao now bows to no one.    As he circulates to the bar, unimpressed.  To the bouncer:   Top Dollar?   Funboy?   Funboy?  Bartender indicates UP with his thumb.  Grange moves to the fire stairs door.    Half-sheeted, bloody, a hypo hanging out of his heart.    Eyes darting, drawn to --    A crow silhouette spray-painted with a syringe of Funboy's blood.  A thin outline, drippy.    whirling with his gun to bring it to bear on --    The crow is no longer in the room.  Eric is perched on the sill, guitar and all, looking right at Grange as if waiting from him. He winks, holds a finger to his lips -- sshh --and jumps out into the night.    He almost fires, but doesn't.  We see instead the priceless expression on his face as we --   The son of a bitch winked at me. The he jumped.  Three stories.  Lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's tale.    No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.  Lao's expression is one of sublime content.   You're Elly, right?  I know your mom.  Elly turns.  Grange sits next to her.  Lao's mirrored-windowed car is parked across the street, b.g.   I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.    I'd like to get in touch with him.  Elly sizes Grange up.   I'm looking for a good guitar man.   I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.     Grange sprays the room with a Calico 950 Auto, shoving Lao beneath the table for cover.    making for the door, Grange as shield.  Lao draws a pistol.  The door opens and Lao shoots a Sentry to clear him out of the way.    Entering and crossing to the desk.  As he comes up to the desk, he DRAWS BACK.   What... the hell is that?    Revealing Lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in his hands.  The killing blade is nearby.   That thing is poisonous.   Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...   Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.  Lao chuckles indulgently.   Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.   Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die.  Kill a dead guy?  Lao POPS the second venom sac; swallows it.  Pleased.   Hi, Elly.  Remember me?  Elly's surprise is evident.  Darla is just plain pissed off.    If she opens her face again, shoot her in the head.    He strolls the circuit of the room, stopping near the window.   You should listen to your mother. She said no cats.  Grange pitches Gabriel right out the window.   Now that's the expression I want.   Say cheese.  He snaps.  On the SX-70 WHIRR and flash white-out, we --   We've got company.    Eric Talking to dead air.  Almost arguing with it.  Eerie.    As he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle.   He's just out front talking to himself.  You tell me.    Swapping his tranquilizer gun for a more lethal rifle, similarly scoped.  He sights the fallen Eric in a spray of green light.   I've got him if you want him.    Move in, guys.  HIGH ANGLE - THE SANCTUARY -- as Lao Guards #3 and #4 move into light, closing on Eric's position in the center of isle. Both wield calico's and one bears a sword.  CLOSE ANGLE - ALTER -- Lao makes his entrance from shadow wearing a brisk pugilist get-up, a practical fighting outfit. Makes a show of drawing the killing blade.    Holding the crow by the neck, TIGHTLY.  He plucks the tranq dart from the its body.",
        "Tin": "CLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard.   You're outta your fuckin' mind.  Into it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and T-Bird does likewise.  Points to Skank.   I hate this goddamn thing...  ANGLE - DARLA watching them from a distance as Tin exits.    He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel.  FOLLOW as he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom box  from his shoulder to accept. Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash.   Three hundred and your a gunslinger.  HIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO  As the crow is still watching, yet perched.  A brief shove-and-standoff.  The gun deal has gone bad.   Ratty -- shut the fuck up.  Tin-Tin lifts Ratso on the knife, gutting him.  Ratso goes slack, deader'n hell.  Tin-Tin reaches around to click OFF the boom box... then let's Ratso`s corpse fall.    galvanized by the surprise voice.  He automatically draw a fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside the coat.  Can't yet track the source of the voice.   Who the hell is that?  Come on out man, I won't hurt you.    trying to process what he sees.  And cover.  And buy time.   Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.   Guess you got that goddamn right.  He shrugs.  The shrug becomes the launch of a knife.    as Tin-TIn throws another knife.  Eric closing in.  He claps hand together, immobilizing the next knife.  Opens his hands, almost an \"oops\" gesture.  Keeps on coming.    As they meet.  Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse.  Eric blocks it and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall.   Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.   Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.  They're face-to-face now, sweaty and tense.  Eric peels off the Tragedy mask.   I don't know you...  But, as Eric bears down on Tin-TIn, Tin begins to recognize him. Fear.  Sweat.  For the first time, Tin-Tin starts to loose control.   Holy shit... you're dead, man...    Cop lights bounce, competing with the trash fires.  Albrecht and several other UNIFORMS assess the double-death scene.  A detective, TORRES tries to appear in charge.    Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of him.  Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.",
        "Sarah": "",
        "Eric": "She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird.    DRAVEN fills with blood.  Blood continues groundward.    as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave.    The turf stirs beneath the white rose.  Magically, a slim white parts the earth to grasp the rose.  SKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE  as the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own headstone.    Pale.  Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in back.  WHite shirt.  A nothing tie.  No shoes.  Rain sluices mud from his upturned face.  He looks to the sky.  Lightning.    as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.  Looks o.s.  ERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY  water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched on his arm like a hunting falcon.  He releases it and it flies to the tree.    Watching this.  Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision. The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.  Eric looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy.   What the hell are you?    alone in the cemetery.  After a moments hesitation, he lurches off, following the crow.    Their eyes lock.  Eric stiffens with his first FLASH.  NB:  Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature of things with which he makes physical contact.  Hints and fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR.  Puzzle pieces he must assemble.  Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and accompanied by a degree of pain.  It hurts to remember.    An airborne crow POV spiralling up and away from them.    She fades.  He lets her drop away, horrified.  And staggers back into the cover of the alley.  Her blood is on his hands.    Eric in lurching flight, panting.  Stops and steadies against the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games.    Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes.    looking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand. Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield from:    he reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls.    The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face with his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery --    as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his chest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit wounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow. His glance at the bird is almost accusatory.  ANGLE - THe CROW  Inscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent communication is taking place.    bare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the crow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto his bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s.  Fire.  In the rain.    Blood flows from the gash.  He vises his fist shut.    Eye-to-eye with the crow.  Opens his hand.    The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself, leaving another scar.    Vising the rail.  Speaks to the night.  Almost a mantra.   \"My kitten walks on velvet feet, and makes no sound at all.  And in the doorway nightly sits to watch the darkness fall.  I think he loves the lady night...\"  Am I alive?  Am I dead?  Something else?  Something in between?    Almost bemused.  Steadier.  A hint of friendliness.   Thanks for sharing that.    Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him on.  Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.   All right.  And he takes off on a run.  Only to stumble and fall.  But the falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet still moving.  He looks back as if to ask: \"Did I do that?\" and runs out of the frame.    as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up. TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.  He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next roof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a WOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining strength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic.    Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space...    Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed.  He hangs for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment, executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.  Gotcha.  He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the ledge.  As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.    It's a looooooong way down.    as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one piece.   Thanks.     Where're we going next -- the sewer?    A year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape... which now sags, faded.  A sticker across the jam notifies potential trespassers that this is -- was -- a crime scene.  Eric slows, stops, his hand on the banister.    Eric has had enough.   Are we finished yet?   sliding along, as he speaks, until it hits a cigarette burn.    stiffening as he suffers his second --  FLASH:  IMAGES and DIALOG are not linked.  A rapidfire MONTAGE set in the loft, a year earlier . The broken door.  The stairwell is filled with cops and cop noise; lab guys bustle.  Albrecht is there, making notes as a DETECTIVE steps over to him.    He sits down hard, hurting from the flash.  His eyes seek the crow.  He completes Albrecht's line:   \"Draven, Eric.\"    He scans the loft.  Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor.    A white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light.    He kneels.  Extends his hand.  The cat nears; likes Eric.    as the cat makes contact.  Sudden white jolt - a FLASH.  FLASH:  we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s.  We see what he saw:  Shelly, holding the cat.    Wincing.  Recovering from the flash.  He purposefully gathers the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger...  FLASH:  A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred points of candlelight.  Shelly and Eric, once upon a time.    as the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way.    vising his head, teary-eyed, his nose bleeding.   No!  Don't look!  No! No!  He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through the masonry wall. FLASH:  Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz.  He spins her and they collapse on the bed.    slowly pulling his arm out of the wall.    Stop it.  His eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like a drowning man.    He's awake.  Pushes himself up.    He's awake.  Pushes himself up.  Realizes he is in the center of a faint chalk outline on the hardwood floor.  He reaches to touch the dark stain of old blood.  FLASH:  Shelly spills into frame, mouth bloodied.  T-Bird instantly on top of her, rough.    as he abandons the outline and staggers to the window... where he cuts open his hand on jags of glass.  FLASH:  Eric held firm in the grasp of T-Bird and Funboy, one arm each.  Five bloody bullet holes in Eric's chest.  The thugs 1-2-3 and hurl Eric backwards through the window, which shatters.    Reeling backward, same trajectory as in the Flash, but toward the floor, in SLO-MO.  Overloaded.  Blacking out.    A jumble of good/bad images from the loft:  Tin-Tin embedding a page of paper in the loft wall with a throwing knife... Shelly's face as she lights a candle... a POPPING champagne cork... the echoing CANNONADE of the shots that killed Eric... Skank backhanding Shelly... Shelly blowing bubbles from a clawfoot tub full of suds... Eric catching Funboy's first slug high in the chest... NEW ANGLE of the glass in the window blowing out as T-Bird and Funboy through Eric through...    He plummets to BLACK OUT FRAME.  THUMP.  Out cold.    rising from the floor.  Careful.  Stealthy.  Watches his fireplace.   We have company.   Shelly?   Yes.    As he DUCKS out of the path of the knife he sees through the bird's eyes.  He rolls.   Goddammit.  He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH.  FLASH:  Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife stuck in his shoulder.    vising his head with his hands, in pain.  Too much pain.   Leave me alone -- !  He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there.    A horrible beat between them.  The Eric runs full tilt across the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping.    FLIES feet first out into space.    Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension.  Hold.  Then he relaxes, and swings back inside.    He arches, flips, to land on his feet.  The Skull Cowboy is gone.  No knife either.  The crow watches.  O.S. \"meow\".     I guess I'm not ready to leave... just yet.  He picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this time -- and returns to the window.  Feeling safer.   The last time we saw each other, I didn't do so well.  Huh, Gabriel?  He moves to the fireplace.  With his free hand, lifts the Tragedy mask off its hook.  Puzzles it, fact-to-mask.   I bet you need some cat food... right?    As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen.  Slows.  Stops. And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley.   Another satisfied customer?    He steps out from behind another flaming trashcan.  Wearing a long black scarf and the Tragedy mask.   Hello, Tin-Tin.   Murderer.  Tin-Tin blows out a breath.  No bluff.  Time to kill again.    His black-gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from his nose.  It CLATTERS.  Eric continues striding toward Tin-TIn.   Try harder.  Try again.    as Tin-TIn throws another knife.  Eric closing in.  He claps hand together, immobilizing the next knife.  Opens his hands, almost an \"oops\" gesture.  Keeps on coming.    As they meet.  Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse.  Eric blocks it and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall.   A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.   You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!   I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.     Victims.  Aren't we all.     Halloween is coming.  The Day of the Dead...  In the mirror, multi Eric's.  He touches the glass, tightening up as he realizes he's in for another --  FLASH:  Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric  says \"Boo\".  She cracks an eye open.    Considering old cosmetics.  Everything he touches will hurt him. But he's ready to eat this pain.  He grabs a lipstick.  FLASH:  Shelly at the vanity in happier times    wincing.  He drops the lipstick on the floor.  Grabs a hairbrush.  FLASH:  Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall, trailing broken glass.    Later.  He's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks.  Shaky.  FLASH:  Eric sucks up Funboy's gunshots in the chest.  1-2-3-4.    his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended yet.  He looks at his own reflection.  In one cracked, triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face, but the Skull Cowboy.  Just one.   Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.   Forget this.  He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave white.    as it glides down to pick up the lipstick.  CONTACT, and --  FLASH:  Eric, smashed on the street, T-Bird's car b.g., upside down in Eric's POV as he rolls over and blood courses from both corners of his mouth,  a definite foreshadow of the \"Crow\" face.     She always red red was her color.    crossing the floor.  Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework.    The storm boils.  Eric framed in broken window.    Eric all in black,  Firm-wrapped.  Tight-wired.  The trenchcoat flutters, cloak-like.  His shadowy face framed by the upturned collar, his hair punkish and spiky.    as he moves forward in the light.  The crow lights on his shoulder.   All right, bad guys...    Full crow regalia.  Face makeup streamlined.  Eric's eyes flash.    Here I commme -- !  PULL BACK swiftly, vertiginously, as Eric swan dives from the window, his voice a howl.    Coat, wing-like.  MATCH his dive yell with o.s. crow SCREECH. SLOW MOTION as Eric fills the frame and we --   \"Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\"  You heard me rapping, right?   I'm looking for something in an engagement ring.  Gold.  As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.   I repeat: a gold engagement ring. It was pawned here, a year ago, by another gentleman whose name, I believe was... \"T-Bird\"?    Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red.   Cute nickname, don't you think?   Wrong answer.  Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top.  Gideon howls!    scans the shelves.  Rows of boxed ammo.  Kerosene tins.  A shotgun. Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios.  And the ring box.    Dozens of gold rings.  Eric's fingers sift through them.    He brings each ring to his face.  INTERCUT with Gideon's feeble struggles and invective, o.s.   No... no... no... no...  He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder.  Until:    Obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light --  FLASH:  Shelly's face.  A perfect vision...    He closes his fist tightly around the ring.  A moment of decision.  Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter. Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand.  It goes spinning across the countertop.  Eric shucks the shotgun and rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.   Tin-Tin confided in me, before he ran out of breath.  You have one chance to live.  Who would waste time killing you... besides me?  Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand.   Another jolly nickname?   T-Bird?   A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...  Eric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed hand.  Blows just miss Gideon's head.  Soon he's cowering.    Looking down at Gideon in revulsion.   You feed off the living.  SMASH!  as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon.  Then Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him entirely.  As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables.  He reaches for it.    The guitar now bowslung across his back, the shotgun levelled at Gideon's position.   One chance to live.  Take it.    as he cuts loose with the shotgun.    lit by flames and residual explosions.  He hurls the shotgun into the inferno.  Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus from his own clothes.    as he turns slowly, to see Albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn. Eric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here.   I thought the police always said \"freeze:.  Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of Eric , and the raging instant inferno of Gideon's.   And I say I'm dead... and I move.   Then shoot, if you will.     You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.  Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed gun.  B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.   Listen:  Top Dollar.  He \"owns the street here.\"  He will \"erase my ass.\"   I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.   The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht.  Eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk.  Slow and easy. Albrecht doesn't completely trust him.  Up comes the gun.    as Eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall... then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht.    as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up.    He smiles for what seems to be the first time.  Warm, even past his crow makeup.   Sometimes.  He glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not in a big hurry just now.  Turns back to Elly.     I dabble.  May I?  He indicates the car hood, a \"seat\" next to Elly from which he may observe the Pit.    Still hanging by the car, a bit more familiar with each other now.  A low-slung mirror-windowed LIMOUSINE hisses past them and curbs across the street from the Pit.   Who?   Mister Funboy lives there?     I can pick out a tune now and again.   Does she have a name?    Pain is trying to fight it's way out of Eric in surges.   No.   I have to go.  Half-zomboid, half-determined, he exits.    Climbing.  The crow perched on his shoulder.  Not in a hurry.   It's a Raymond Chandler evening And the pavements are all wet, And I'm lurking in the shadows, for it hasn't happened ...    Impish.  Clown killer.   ... yet.    Eric's gloved hand slides sinuously up rusted railing.   Here Funboy.  Contained panic as Funboy and Darla both startle.  The needle flies and lands at Eric's feet.  Empty.  Funboy struggles to maintain against his high.   Take your shot funboy.  You got me, dead bang.  Funboy tilts the gun off target.  Grins as Eric flat handedly past his chest, indicating where to shoot.    Looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest.   Bull's eye.  Good shot.   Stay.  Eric twists her arm.     Morphine is bad for you.  He holds her arm captive.  Tight, and we PUSH IN CLOSER to see the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's, Blood trail.  The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor. Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious.  She slumps.   Magic.  Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar.   Neither.   Does it hurt?   I have some pain killer right here.  And he fills the syringe all the way.   Your pain ends now.  And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home the full dose.  Funboy begins to convulse.  Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent.  Darla COMES TO in the corner, shock-traumatized.  On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens his eyes.  The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.    streaked with -- mostly -- his own blood.     Go away.   Shut up.   Your daughter is out there, on the street, waiting for you.  She's stunned, utterly speechless.  All she can do is look in Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.   Go.  Now.  Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without a glance back at Funboy.  Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door, stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with Funboy.  The Skull Cowboy has vanished.  PUSH IN.  Grimly, Eric takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.   Freeze.  Albrecht startles; drops his file.  Nearly draws his gun.   I saw it, too.  Albrecht gathers up the file.  Eric stands there.  We realize he is hesitant about touching the file.   Walk with me.  As Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk.     I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?    We see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the Flash.    And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own head.  His crow face slacked in realized horror.   The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.  Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.   My name.   Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...    Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single contemplative puff from it.   Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.   Thank you.  For giving a damn.   Don't smoke these.  As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and simultaneously ducks out of frame.   I'm your passenger.  You drive. And stop talking.   Faster, T-Bird.  Faster.  You're a hell of a wheelman; you know you can drive faster.    Eric now holds T-Bird's own gun on him.  Eyes locked on T-Bird. T-Bird's jump between Eric's nightmare visage and the roadway.   That's good.  We're going someplace you've never been before.   You caught one.  Drive faster.   I want you to stop talking.  And drive.  Drive faster.  Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips for the gun.  Sunglasses.  A giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to T-Bird).  Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's tape.  What Eric needs.   You're very popular.  Thought you could handle this thing.  T-Bird macho calcifies.  He's going to win.    Naturally.    T-bird respirating like a jackhammer.  Eric holds stoic.   Time for your reward, T.  Payback with interest earned.  Eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll.    He drops an incendiary right into T-Bird's lap.  T-Bird squirms. No go.  Eric reaches in with a bungie cord.   A little restrictive?  Good.  You held her down and raped her. You were the first.  She burned while you were inside of her.  What's the lag on this?  About twenty seconds, would you say?  T-bird thrashes, but he's immobilized.  Can't even budge the wheel.   I've comrades in hell, T-bird. Give them my best.  Eric activates the timer.  Yanks up hard on the bungie cord.    thumbing out the final bullet.     All gone.    heaving the gun into the distant water.  Plosh.  He produces T- Bird's accelerator.  Squirts it into the ground.  He prestidigitates and T-Bird's Zippo appears in his hand.  He flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle.    walking slowly out of the scene as the firepool coalesces into a burning crow shape.    He's got it right this time.  Strong, sure CHORDS.  Passionate. We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery. He holds a stroke, letting it ring.  Sun rises behind him.    No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode.  He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity in the big open living room.  On purpose, he stretches hard against the bedroom doorframe.  FLASH:  Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window wearing a rococo Victorian gown.  PUSH IN TIGHT as she is embraced by a nude Eric.  He undoes the last few remaining ties that hold the gown in place.  FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples down the length of Shelly's  body to the floor...    hanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring.  Breathing as though he is pumping iron, pumping up.    embracing a ragged full-length dress that used to be Shelly's.  FLASH: Eric and Shelly , exchange an extremely passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight.    as he drops the dress.  Absorbing the pain and memories.    executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill. He grasps it with both hands.  FLASH:  A series of CLOSE SHOTS of Eric and Shelly's HANDS, each moving along the other's body.  Curves and dips and contours. But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes.    His GAZE similarly FIXED.  Bringing his hands away and clapping them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like Kung Fu prep.  When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before him on the sill.   That's better.  He wipes his torso down with a towel.   It's almost time.  He holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it.  We can HEAR tendons CRACKLE like a harness.  Closes it into a powerful fist.    from the ledge.  Endstamp is for a .45 caliber.    He sniffs the cartridge.  We can see Funboy's cartridge in his hair.  He fists the shell casing tightly.    Bullets hit him and demolish everything behind him.  Skank hits the deck again.  Eric fires and Lao Guard #1 sucks three hits across the chest, firing convulsively against the ceiling, blowing the lights.     You have to be SKank.  One moment.  As he speaks, WIDEN FRAME as he turns and grabs the incoming Skank by the hair.   Thank of a snappy comeback for me on your way down.  Without a beat he pitches Skank right out the window!  Skank howls all the way down.   Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...   Do you know what you destroyed?   A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.   It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?  Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger.   You don't even remember...   Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.  And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier, slams Top into the wall.  Nose-to-nose.  FLASH:  Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft, trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared.    Top is quivering, almost helpless in Eric's hypnotic grasp. Eric winces, hard, and --  FLASH:  Shelly cut, bleeding, struggling against T-Bird.  Wild.    Viciously close, more intimate and lethal than anything.   You're a detail man, Top -- you need to see more.  This time Top tries to twist from Eric's grasp but it's no good.  FLASH: Shelly, comatose in ICU, eyes fixed and staring, hoses darting in and out, cold blue refrigerator light.  Bloody, bruised and broken     All of her pain, Top.  Thirty hours.  All at once...  Eric bears down on Top Dollar again.  Top screams.  Blood begins to leak from his eyes, nose, ears.   ...all for you.  FLASH:  Rapidfire CLOSE-UPS.  A jagged compound fracture, jutting, Shelly's eye, blood-red sclera, purpled and sunken.  Her scraped-raw hand clawing at air.  Icebox lighting.  A TIGHT SHOT of her monitor going flatline: eeeeeeeeeeeeee...    as Top sags in Eric's grasp, terror fixing his wide-staring dead eyes.  Eric lets him drop like a laundry sack.   I didn't think you could handle it either.  O.S. BANG of impact, heavy against the steel door.  Eric turns.    using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the incoming SWATS while launching himself into the air, flipping toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops open fire on command.  Bullets tear the room to pieces.    A forearm up against the fusillade.  Below him --    Eric runs for it.  Half a story higher.  He hits the wall and skitters up, gripping tiny cracks in the brickwork.    He sprints to the far edge and dives to the next lower rooftop. As he lands he is nailed by a helicopter spotlight, boring in from behind and above the row of buildings.    PAN QUICK to the next ledge.  COPS right behind him on the roof as well.    and finds a void waiting there.  No connecting building.    staying ahead of the search light.  A fantastic series of artful moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof.    as his escape is cut off by a police car that screeches to a stop, blocking the exit.    as he backpedals, scanning for an alternate escape.   It's done.  Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.   It's only a flesh wound.   You shouldn't smoke these.  He pitches the smoke out the open car window.   I'm finished.  Eric shoots him a doubtful look.   I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...   They couldn't do anything for me.   No.  I have one more thing to do.     I have to prepare for an anniversary.  This coming night.  HOLD on their two kinds of determination. as we    Without looking toward the door, he speaks.   A remembrance.  A closure.  And Eric consigns to the fire the DRESS we saw earlier.  Holds a photograph in a broken frame.  Cracked glass.  Subject: Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera.  He chucks it into the fire.  Draws a deep breath.   Better now.  I feel good.  How are you, Elly, my friend?  Elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see Eric.  Eric is staring at her, intently.   What is it?  You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.   Elly...  He draws her close.  Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb.   Sometimes the people we care about are gone, for no reason.  Sometimes that's really tough.  I cry.  But if the people we love are gone, we keep them --  He taps Elly's temple, then his won.   -- right here.  It's a big responsibility.  And that makes it okay to mourn.  I know that if you weren't here, I'd be very sad.  Elly gives Eric a hug.   Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel?  Gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them. Elly is immediately smitten.  Happy.   I think he's yours, now.  The cat seems to like that idea.  Elly wraps him hugely up in her arms, talking to him: \"How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'\"    While Elly is preoccupied with the cat, Eric gives up his last bit of Shelly to the fire - a portrait photo of her, small and creased.  He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat, then turns to Elly.   I have something else for you.  BACK FOCUS as Eric lifts off his neck Shelly's ring for Elly's inspection.  The ring twirls large in f.g.   Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...    The crow flies past behind him as his expression hardens.    Pulling on black night-fighting clothes, skintight.    Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning.    A fire engine races past on the street.  He steps out in its wake and crosses over to --    He pauses.  A KID in a Creature from the Black Lagoon mask comes, passes Eric, then comes back for a touch.    Angry, ready to battle:  You talking to me?   Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.    Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them.   Fine with me.  He ADVANCES a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast.   I'm already alone.    Eric Talking to dead air.  Almost arguing with it.  Eerie.    Eric, eyes steely, stares down the Skull Cowboy.   Don't waste my time.    As Eric lunges for what's left of his mysterious, smart-ass mentor   Meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the Skull Cowboy's heart would have been.    He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too, renders down to nothingness,  leaving a vague green glow that dies.  And as he looks to the sky --   But why are you still here?    That's good enough for Eric.  He marches to the double doors and shoves them back.    The high breeze blows in with him, disturbing dust in the disused Gothic dark.  Hollow cathedral ECHOES to sounds.  A giant 27\" TV positioned on the alter, broadcasting static.    Leery of potential danger from a thousand dark places.    Onscreen:  Elly, gagged with duct tape and handcuffed to an iron ring bolted to a flagstone wall.  Could be anywhere inside the church.   I can see her.    Bluring as Grange resights.  Eric is not the target.  Blur FINDS the crow at the far end of the nave, perched in front of a giant stained glass window.  NEW ANGLE - GRANGE -- squeezing off two quick, SILENCED shots.  ANGLE - STAINED GLASS WINDOW -- the first shot blows a hole in some pastoral religious presentation.  TINKLE of glass.  ANGLE - ERIC -- Spinning at the quiet !pfut! sound, to witness.    As before, but the crow is not as fast.    His knees buckle.  Sympathetic PAIN from the hit.    Groping for support to drag himself back to standing.   I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.    Crashing to one knee, invisibly bludgeoned, struggling to breathe.  Lao has no fear, walking around the stricken Eric.   You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.   This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.   Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.   Don't interfere.   Here I am.  DOWNFRAME lightning STRIKES the ornate LIGHTNING ROD (large, Victorian, lance-like) at the far end of the roof from the bell tower.  SILHOUETTING Lao and Elly standing in front of it.  Elly flinches at the strike.    Rage over the loss of Albrecht.  He RISES, hurting but mad as hell.  GLARES UP toward Lao.   And how many lives have you destroyed?    Eyes alight with hatred for Lao.    You're right, I'm not an avenger. Not any more.  As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY.   Time for a sacrifice.  Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the eyes used to be.  He smiles gruesomely.   Can you fly?  He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM   Eric lands on his back, forcing the blade THROUGH himself and INTO Lao.  Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO SPACE, the killing blade still embedded in him!  WITH LAO as crashes, sliding, sprawling down PAST Elly's position.  Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress.  Sees the blade in his own chest.  CLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen.  RESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric.  He PLUMMETS off the roof edge.  ANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF --  He slows, stopping when Elly is in frame.  He clutches his own chest.  Regards his own shaking hand, drenched in his won blood.  Glazed.  ON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying to get to Eric.  She flails and cries out.   In a better place.  I hope.   I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.   For you, I'll try.  Promise.    Spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never going to make it the few yards back to his own grave.  So close.  His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus.  One groping hand tries to drag him further.   Leave me now.    Still too far away to matter.    He gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat before SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand.  No ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's blank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward.    Eric is gone.  The white rose lies neatly on the top of the undisturbed  earth there.",

        "Skank": "What about working girl?  INTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions.   I say we leave her here to fry, man.  T-Bird looks casually at the woman.  Smiles hideously.   Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red light!   Dump her, man, dump her!  The woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a war hoop from the guys inside.   Hey, blow me, fat boy!  Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank.   You wouldn't want Top Dollar not to smile.  Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up.  He hands over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace.   Fuck you, T-Bird.  Just as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed right under Skank's jawbone.  He makes a kissy face.   I wish to hell I had torched Gideon's, that fat fuck.    They stop walking.  Look at each other and sanctimoniously cross themselves.  Tin-Tin's big R.I.P. moment.  T-Bird indicates the liquor store.   Got it.  Skank hustles toward the store.  T-Bird crosses to the car.    He looks outside and sees Eric as the car fires up, pipes and glasspacks grumbling.  Skank moves, BRISTLING.   What's all this happy horseshit?  And the car peels out maniacally!  Skank tries to pursue -- but the two KIDS draw weapons and freeze everyone in the store.   Top, I made the sumbitch!  Face all painted white like some kinda fuckin' kabuki homo!  WIDE ANGLE to include all present:  Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1 and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry.  Top dusts up a line and rinses his nostrils with brandy.    The found T-bird flash-fried to what was left of his fucking car!  Top is angry too, but won't show it to Lao.  He rises and goes to the window.  Neon glow.  Top sees something outside, below, that really torques him off.    Jittery, grabbing a clip for his own automatic.   What was that -- !?  It wasn't anything.  Skank loads, stands and jacks the action on his gun.  Lao looks questioningly to Top Dollar.    spinning mid-air to land in Eric's open hand!    Wounded but clawing toward Eric just the same.   It's him, Top!  He dusted T-Bird!",
        "Funboy": "Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?    As a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots.   Let's have some fun.  Funboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down. T-Bird turns to Tin-Tin, the new guy.  T-BIRDYou first.   Hey, pussycat.    Funboy contemplates his drink as the previous scene reverbs.   More fun than a torture chamber.  Tin-Tin's pocket pager goes BEEP and startles them all.  Skank nearly shoots it, jumpy.  Tin-Tin pulls back on a black leather trenchcoat after clicking off the pager.    CLOSE-UP of a base pipe being lit and hit hard.    A hypodermic needle rises into frame.  A nicotined fingernail flicks bubbles in the syringe.  FOLLOW needle down and BROADEN ANGLE: Funboy taps up a vein in Darla's arm and shoots her up. Both are naked in a shabby bed.  Bare lightbulb above.   It's a squab.  Here bird, Here, birdie...    Except that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the bird's position, the guitar bowslung.   Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.   It's just the dope, don't worry   Not me.  Funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers.  Suddenly he seems totally focused.   Time for you to take your bird and leave, freako.  Eric rips open his shirtfront to reveal a circlet of bullet punctures.  This gives Funboy pause.  You are seriously fucked up, man. Just look at yourself.  In a blur, he sighs, and shoots Eric through the heart.   BANG!  He shoots, he scores!  Then his expression drags a little bit.     How the hell did you do that?   Either die or do a solo.  Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing.  He can't seem to make it tie off fast enough.  He turns his attention back to Funboy.  But his strength is mysteriously ebbing.   Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.  Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the gun.  Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric relentlessly.   I hate trespassers!  I hate prowlers!  I hate peeping toms!  And right now I hate you!   Ahh, the hell with it, I still got five shots left.  In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand.  Twists to the crunching of bones.  Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a hole in his own thigh.  Funboy fall back across the bed.   Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!   Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!  Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already inserted.    as he begins to see the light.  He can't get away.  Growing terror.   No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !    Grange has seen the door ajar and now ENTERS gun-first.  Freezes when he sees:    Half-sheeted, bloody, a hypo hanging out of his heart.    A crow silhouette spray-painted with a syringe of Funboy's blood.  A thin outline, drippy.",
        "Torres": "Couldn't have happened to a nicer couple.    Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of him.  Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.   You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?   Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?   Was.  And you're gonna tell me who.   What in the hell... do you call that?",
        "Top": "Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him on.  Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.    Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline. The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb.    as Eric's hands place Ratso's boom box on the table and click on suitable weird b.g. MUSIC.    As T-Bird nears it, a viewplate SNAPS open to asses him.  By the time he reaches the top, the door unbolts to admit him.    As T-Bird enters.  The room is organized around a long meeting table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal:  drug paraphernalia, weapons.  Across the table are a couple of Sentries like the one that admits T-Bird to the room.  TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by Showtime's exterior neon.  This is TOP DOLLAR.  Who looks like a Johnny Winter acid casualty but is deadly cold, definitely the man in charge.   Wild fucking night.  I hear our pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead.   Bet that pisses you off, right?   Stay normal, T.  Cops'll be all hotwired and aggressive.  No combat moves until I check this out.    right in the center of the noise, looking downscale and dirty in this milieu.   I thought Halloween was tomorrow night.  An Oriental bodyguard passes him in f.g., motioning to follow.   Get outta my way, you mooks.  Lao's demeanor indicates that they should not kill Top.   Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.   One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.   I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.   Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.    TIGHT on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table.  He has a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter.   \"Our\" Crow...?    The night is young.    Top whip-drawing an auto pistol and shooting below.   Hey, you little fuckweed!  That's against the law!  His gun smoking.  Momentary empowerment.   I don't give a shit what kinda bird this guy is.    LAO AT TABLE -- angered by this macho horseshit, annoyed at his time being frittered.   Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?   Whatever you say, I can do.  Skank looks around, nervous and jumpy, a contradiction to Top's guarantee.    from the ledge.  Endstamp is for a .45 caliber.   Too many poppers, Skank.  Relax.  Heel.    A black blur as Eric arches through, spilling Top.    springing up from behind table.  But Eric is gone from the field of fire and one shot strikes Skank, rising at the far end.    You want my attention, man you got it.      Just Top, Eric, corpses, and lazily drifting gunsmoke.   Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.   Take the dope, too.  Eric backhands Top into the wall.  Gets in his face, seething.   That's ancient history.   Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!   I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.    Top is quivering, almost helpless in Eric's hypnotic grasp. Eric winces, hard, and --  FLASH:  Shelly cut, bleeding, struggling against T-Bird.  Wild.    Viciously close, more intimate and lethal than anything.    arching, stiffening in pain.      as Top sags in Eric's grasp, terror fixing his wide-staring dead eyes.  Eric lets him drop like a laundry sack.    Eric somersaults over.  Bullets chip brick in his wake.    Eric runs for it.  Half a story higher.  He hits the wall and skitters up, gripping tiny cracks in the brickwork.    Dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset.  Eric plays the guitar - LOUD, the SHelly theme in a major key.  Where before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and heartbreaking.  Definitive.  Pain replaced by strength and a sense of homecoming.  As Eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out... At the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it down -- SMASH -- on the Pignose.  He's finished here.    Transparent, ancient bones, crumbling and blowing away.    SEEING the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes.    As the crow wings down INTO FRAME and lights on Lao's head, CLAWING!  CLOSE-UP -- THE CROW ON LAO'S HEAD slashing with its claws. Pecking out Lao's eyes.  WITH ERIC -- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his climb, the crow/Lao UPFRAME B.G.  RESUME LAO -- as the crow abandons him.  Lao STAGGERS AND FALLS down the roof - toward Eric. SLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Lao's fall, fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose.

        "Gideon": "As the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside.  Menacing.    A junkyard of loot and dusty discards.  Junkie thievings and other people's stereos.  Behind a wire-meshed security counter GIDEON reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene.  He is pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt.  Food on his shirt.  JINGLE of doorbells.  Gideon lowers his paper to reveal Skank and T-Bird on approach.   Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the night, here they come.  Tweedledum and Tweedledummer.  Skank riles   Blow yourself, bigmouth.   Whatcha got?   18k.  Crap.   Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,   What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --    CLOSE-UP of Gideon's thick fingers shuffling grimy currency. Some scratchy 1920's TUNE plays throughout b.g., like a broadcast from another time and place.    looking up at a metallic SOUND, o.s.  Irritated.   Piss off, we're closed.  As the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum and approaches the front door.   Fucking creatures of the night; they never goddamn learn.  Sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate SCREE back against the frosted glass of the front door.     reacting to Eric's weird appearance and looking for his gun.   Oh, bullshit!  You're trespassing asshole, you're breakin' and enterin' and you just bought me a fucking door!  During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his shoulders, nonplussed.  Now he flings Gideon across the room.  Gideon crashes into the counter cage.  As Eric advances on him:   You're looking for a coroner,shit- for-brains!  And he tries to nail Eric with the knife.    No Eric behind him.  TILT to reveal Eric hanging off the cage above Gideon.  Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head. Drops down like a spider and collects the knife.    Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red.    I ain't got no fuckin' ring.   All's I got is in a box!  Behind the counter!  Eric jumps through the cage door.  Gideon's eyes bug as he sees his own pierced hand, immobilized.   No fucking way.  He'll kill me.    Top Dollar.   You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.   Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.    As he summons some last minute budget bravery.   You walk outta here Top Dollar will erase your ass!  Top Dollar owns the fucking street here and you can't dick with me, you son of a bitch!    as he realizes what Eric means.  Hauls ass and bangs through the rear door with a bleat of terror.    as seen from across the street.  Eric silhouetted, unmoving as the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him, raining glass and debris.  Stirring his hair.  Eric is the black eye of the fireball.",
        "Albrecht": "ALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker.  MICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy open-front fast foodery.   You gotta put the mustard underneath first.   Here, let me do it.  He grabs the dog from Mickey.  Mickey puffs his cigar while he cooks.  Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling the dog in the bun.  Flashes Mickey a \"gimme\" look.   Come on... onion.  Don't cheap out on me.  Lotta onions.   How do you ride that thing on a wet street?   Care for a hot dog?   I'm buying.  Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht.  They`ve done this routine before.    No onions?    Reacting, with a mouthful.   Goddammit.  Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly.   Yeah, do it!  Stay right there!  HOLD ON MICKEY.  He points at Albrecht's hot dog.  Yecch.    Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement.  Aims at the departing car.  Gives it up.  Still too far away.  Pedestrians in the way.    Skidding in, spotting the woman.  Kneeling to her.   Here now!  You're gonna be okay! Can you understand me?  I'm a police officer...  The woman is no longer in pain.  Deathly calm now.   What did you say?   Oh no... don't go, darlin', you stay with me, now... shit!   Victim's name is Shelly Webster. The guy who got tossed is, uh ...--   Albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister.    Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of him.  Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.   Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.   This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.   He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.    This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.  Albrecht lights a fresh smoke.  Torres waves the smoke away.   Who ever made that.  Albrecht points.  CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin.  A crow silhouette has been daubed in blood there, now dry.   I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.   Don't move! I said don't move.   I'm the police and I say don't move, Snow White.  You're under arrest; I don't care what else is wrong with you!  You move and you're dead.  Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht.  Palms up.  A gesture of submission.  Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.   No further.  I'm serious.  Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.    He gives it up.  Can't shoot.  This is too weird for him.   Are you nuts, walking into a gun?     You wanna run that back for me one time?  SIRENS near, o.s.  Eric listens to them, to the night.   You don't say.   Fucking A, my friend.   Watch it...  Eric slices open his palm.  Blood flows.  To his fingertips.    as Eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall... then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht.    and the silhouette.  Mouth hangs.   You're the one who did Tin-Tin...  PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame.  Albrecht does a quick 180.  No Eric.  Flashbars from incoming units begin to bounce red and blue off his face.   Great.  Good night.  Guy shows up looking like a mime from hell.  Least he didn't do that \"walking against the wind\" shit;  I hate that.   Annie?    Albrecht enters frame from across her countertop.   Annie, I need a file.  There is a desperate edge to Albrecht's voice.   This is special, darlin'.  Please?  Annabella eyes Albrecht doubtfully.  Fatalistic sigh.   Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.    flipping through the file. Smoking.    Subject: Eric, dead in the street in front of the loft building.  The blood on his face reminiscent of his crow face.  As Albrecht's hand moves the photo we can see in the file several band shots of Eric as a member of Diabolique... including the shot on Lao's wall gallery of past performers at Club Trash.  A DOUGHUT on a paper plate suddenly touches down in the middle of all this research, startling Albrecht.   I knew that.  Albrecht holds a typewritten page closer to the the light.  CLOSE-UP DOCUMENT, torn by the knife hole made by Tin-Tin.  It reads:  We, the Undersigned tenants of 1929 Calderone Court Apartments...   Another nice white girl with a cause.  Like a big KICK ME sign.  Albrecht takes up and 8x10 of Eric's face.   Shelly Webster.  And her nice white boyfriend, Eric Draven.  With a felt-tip pen he superimposes the crow smile, like the make- up, like the blood.   Could be.   Well, hello there...chocolate,   Thanks, babe.   Jeezus!  Don't ever do that, man!  Albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down.  Eric waits.   I told you cops don't say \"freeze\".  He retrieves Eric's doctored photo from the spill of papers.   You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.     You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --   You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.  They stop.  Eric didn't know this.  Fixes Albrecht with a look.   Hey, you asked, man.  She held on for thirty hours in intensive care.  Hemorrhage, trauma.  He body just finally gave it up.  I saw it and couldn't do jack for her.  Eric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines. Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes.    We see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the Flash.    And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own head.  His crow face slacked in realized horror.   You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.   You gotta understand -- I was hoping she'd talk, give me a lead, a clue, something to work with. But she only said one thing to me before she died.  Eric lowers his head, penitent.    I'm sorry as hell, man.    Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single contemplative puff from it.   I should be trying to stop you.  Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette.   My pleasure.   to see a blank building wall.  Fire escape.  Darkness.  No Eric. He does a full 360 degree turn.  Eric is gone again.   Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that.    who watches with slow marvel from the shadows  Jesus Christ...  He runs to assist the demolished cruiser.    Come on!    Albrecht harried and frantic, but in control.   Keep your head down!  He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit.  Gradually he calms down.   I figured you might need a ride home.  Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch.   I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.   Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.   It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.  Eric sits up as the car gains distance.  Grabs the cigarette out of ALbrecht's mouth.  Takes his single puff.   Great.  Litterbug of the Living Dead.  Eric turns back to Albrecht.    Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?    It hangs a turn and their escape is made.   How 'bout the morgue?     You're gonna kill somebody else.  We're gonna stop and get a shit-load of Band-Aids?  Eric is obviously fighting to stay centered, stay conscious. His last fight has caused him a great deal of damage, taken a lot out of him.  He needs to recharge.   Had to go get yourself hip-deep in shit, didn't you, my friend.  It begins to rain.  Albrecht glances resentfully toward the sky.   Give it a rest, huh?  A hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under.  CUTS LOOSE on full auto into the Madonna on the window.   You sorta looked like you might need my help.   You're welcome.   The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.  Eric stares dead-on at Albrecht, acidly, then BREAKS the Guard's sword, dropping the pieces and turning his back on Albrecht, who pursues Eric to:   You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.  Eric shinnies up the bellrope, ignoring Albrecht.    Watching as Eric dissappears from view, fast..  Grumbles.   You won't mind if I just take the stairs, then, smartass...  He hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the steps.  ANGLE - MOVING WITH ERIC ON THE ROPE -- A weird perspective of speed climb.  Zip!  All the way to the top.    He stops his ascent to light a cigarette.   I ain't cut out for this superhero shit.   Is he dead yet?  INSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's gun quickly.  ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO --Lao has blindsided Albrecht.",
        "Shelly": "as Elly places the gathered flowers down.  Almost reverent.   Your scary quotient needs work.   I think red's my color, don't you?    She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve.  She turns toward Eric's grave.  Then, surprised, she looks close.",
        "Mickey": "What this place needs is a good natural catastrophe.  Earthquake, tornado...    ALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker.  MICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy open-front fast foodery.   Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.   Heyyy -- it's the Elly monster.   What's goin' on, Elly?   Well, how's your friend?   Call it in?  Albrecht is off and running for the corner already.    You want I should save this for you?   Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.   Oh.    Everyone's a comedian.  Enjoy.  Mickey EXITS FRAME."

One by one, Eric gives these thugs a taste of their own medicine.
