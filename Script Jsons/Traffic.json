        "Manolo": "Which one?  Another long pause.   Wasn't that General Salazar?   What's he doing up here?    A cinderblock house.  Kids and dogs in the street.  A face we recognize as Manolo's peers out of a curtain into the street.    The ceiling is stained, the floor sags.  A cheap radio plays. Manolo is at the door.  Javi sits at a dinette table.  He talks to Manolo but watches Manolo's wife, ANNA, 20's, a nice-looking, ostensibly demure young woman, as she moves around the kitchen.   They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.  Manolo tenses, and throws open the window.    Away from the car.  Now!  MANOLO'S POV out the window as KIDS play in the car, sitting behind the wheel.   Shut your fucking mouth.  Nobody's talking to you.  Anna sets a cup of coffee in front of Javi and stares at him.   She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.   Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.   This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.   A group of us are going out tonight.   Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --   Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?   It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.   No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.   There's supposed to be someone here to let you in.  Finally, the door swings open and a BODYGUARD is standing there.  Rosario SQUEALS and sweeps past him into the vast space.  The bodyguard motions for Manolo to put the bags inside the door.  Manolo sets the bags down and sees another MAN standing a few feet away.  The man wears sunglasses.  His complexion is strange and his neck is bandaged.  The body guard escorts Manolo back outside where he hears Rosario's happy LAUGHTER drifting down from an upstairs window.   Madrigal's alive.   Porfirio Madrigal is not dead.  I just saw him.  A long beat as Javier considers this.   Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --   No.  I'm looking for the waiter.  I want to order.   A steak.   That's okay, really.  They each take Manolo by an arm.   I was going to feed them wrong information.  Feed them lies to... it was for...  The men say nothing.  After a beat --   Don't tell Anna I died like this. Tell her it was something else. Tell her it was official business. Tell her that I died doing something honorable.  Please, tell her that for me...    Anna is weeping.  Javier sits next to her.  He puts his arm around her and she leans her head against his shoulder.    Javier KNOCKS on the front door.  There is no answer.  The shades are drawn.  The house is darkened.    Javier sits opposite Anna.",
        "Sanchez": "",
        "Lawyer": "",
        "Rodman": "This informant, paid by the police, using taxpayers dollars to continue his felony drug habit, was the link which allowed police to raid a private farm.  A working farm.  A farm where honest Americans make their living.  One particular justice, ROBERT WAKEFIELD, younger than the others, is clearly bemused by this performance.   The government, in its haste, has employed an army of criminals whose allegiance to the truth is, at best, questionable --  Judge Wakefield interrupts --   I'm sorry the court finds my argument repetitious.",
        "Clerk": "What do you think it is?    Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.   What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?    Arizona.   Maybe there's a book in it.  The clerk takes one of the glasses.",
        "Robert": "Mr. Rodman...it's too bad your client didn't show as much sense in choosing what he planted as he did in choosing his attorney...  A polite chuckle from the justices --   Lately the only variation I'm hearing in your argument is the name of the client.  And you can sit there all day arguing the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates, but you aren't going to convince me that this country has not sanctioned the use of anonymous informants.  Furthermore, there is no sacred protection of property rights in the United Sates.  When you make the decision to have marijuana on your farm, whether it's one joint or an acre of plants, your property can be seized and your property can be sold.   Mr. Rodman, may I offer a piece of advice?  The next time you argue this point before this court, regardless of my whereabouts, I recommend you have something up your sleeve other than your arm.    The office is marble and dark wood.  A young CLERK, black, 29, enters carrying an oddly-shaped gift.  They both look at it.   Depends who it's from.   You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me. (re: the elaborate box Definitely third category.   Depends on the state.   Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?  They both laugh.  Robert reaches up and pulls a bottle of Scotch from a shelf.  He pours a couple of fingers in two glasses.   Not by me.  They toast and drink.    In front of the mirror now, trying on a dark, tasteful jacket.    In the hotel rooms, making the same motions.  Satisfied, he straightens, then turns to look at himself.    Back at the hotel room window now.  Reaches to the table and lifts the wine glass.   I'll be sure to let you know.   Like you protected Landry?   You've done a fine job here, Sir. The Office of National Drug Control Policy is in better shape than when you found it.  Landry tries to determine whether Robert believes this.  He looks around the office as if the policy is hiding somewhere.   There are a lot of encouraging statistics.  The work's just started, but I intend to see it through. You've got my word on that.   I've come in to do a tough job and that's what I'm going to focus on.  General Landry SIGHS.    That's very interesting.  The lobbyist smiles.  Robert sips his drink.    In another room.  Listening to STAN, overweight advocate for the United States Council of Chambers of Commerce.    listening to ETHAN, earnest advocate of harm reduction.    Like you.     You're looking pretty good for an old guy.   Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?   Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.   Noriega is a criminal.    Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.   If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.   What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say \"please\" or \"thank you.\"   Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.   Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.    Somehow, I don't see that happening.   That's frustrating.   As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some \"face time\".   I don't know.   It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired.    Robert is looking at Caroline and he's not happy.  Barbara is there, at a neutral distance from both of them.   Caroline?  How well did you know this boy who overdosed?  She looks up beseechingly.   Okay, honey.  We understand.  You're mother and I have to talk.  Caroline is confused by this reaction.   I think she's lying.    We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.   Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.   This is different.   To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.   Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?   How long have you known about this?  No response.    How long have you known?   Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.   I appreciate you coming in so early.   Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.   I don't know what you mean.   I... I don't really know.   No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.    Robert in his car, thinking.  The streets are empty.  He picks up the cell phone.    It's Robert.  Wipe your schedule clean for the next three days.  I'm tired of talking to experts who never set foot outside the beltway.  It's time to see the front lines.   Any idea how much?   What do you look for?   Any way we can do it better?   That triple the amount of stuff is going through.   Who are these guys?    looking through the binoculars.   He died in a liposuction surgery, right?   Who do we interface with on their side?   I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?   I want everyone thinking out the box for a second.  What are we gonna do about Mexico?  Come on, guys.  Out of the box.  The men on the plane just stare at him.  Finally the REP FROM DEA leans forward.   Unlimited.   Come on.  I want to hear from everyone: FBI.  Customs.  Treatment. Is there anyone from treatment on this plane?  Then I want an answer for why there isn't anyone from treatment.  Look, we know we have to bust one of these cartels, Juarez or Tijuana, not just as a symbol, but hell yes, also as a symbol - they are symbols - and there's nothing wrong with sending a message.  That's why when Carlos Ayala hired Michael Adler lead defense, I flew Ben Williams to San Diego to prosecute.  Because he's the best we have, he's our symbol that we're serious about putting the top people away.  So, as of right now, this flight only, consider the dam on new ideas thrown open.  Still, no one else says anything.  They watch Robert impassively.   If I'm not mistaken, we got DEA, Pentagon, U.S. Attorneys office, about a billion dollars of budget right here.  So what are you people waiting for?   I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.   Possibly.  Another silence.   Barbara --   The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.   Look, I'm as worried as you are --   Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.  She looks at him, stung.   I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.   Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.    Caroline.  Open this door immediately.  Caroline is up like a shot.  She looks around.  The POUNDING on the door gets stronger.  She crumples the foil and drops it in the toilet.  The bathroom door SOUNDS like it's about to cave inward.   You're not going anywhere, young lady.  She stands there; she's very high.  Robert sniffs the air.  He throws open cabinets, searching for drugs.  He sees the smudge mark on the counter left by the charred aluminum foil.   Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?   Fuck me?  Oh, okay.  Fuck me.  Fuck you.  Robert is losing it.  He throws stuff around the bathroom and then, for the first time, looks up.  He sees the long light in the box atop the medicine cabinet and it dawns on him.   I'm going to ask you one time to tell me the truth so that I can help you.  She just stares.   Okay, young lady, that's it.   What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.   Oh, yes I can.   I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.   You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.   Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.   Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?    Robert is on the telephone, listening.  He is not happy. Sheridan watches him.    Nobody saw her leave?  Yes... I understand.  He hangs up.  He stands and reaches for his jacket.   I have to go.  I have to go home.   No, not yet.    sit in a coffee shop.   She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.   She hasn't called you?    He turns a corner and is suddenly in a drive-thru drug market. Dealers, HUSTLERS, run at the windows from both sides, signaling.    in the coffee shop.   Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?   I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.   I don't give a fuck about your parents --   What?   You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she.    It is surrounded.  Robert stares.  A face presses up against the window.    What do you mean, what do I want?   I don't want anything.     You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.     I'm looking for my daughter.  The dealer looks at him with disgust, turns his back, and waves everyone else away.  Robert slams his fist against the steering wheel.  He slams it again and again.  He stops and pulls away, just as   About the other night, I'm sorry.   God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?    Robert sleeps in his clothes on top of the covers.  Barbara is asleep beside him.  The phone rings.  Robert answers. Barbara watches.   Hello.   No, it's all right.  There's a beat.   What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.   I'll get there as soon as I can.    I have to call you back.   So's the video camera.   She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.  Ten minutes after that she'll be at her dealer's.  If I find him, maybe I find her.   Seth has to be excused.  He's going on a field trip.    Robert and Seth are parked across the street from Sketch's building.  They watch people, mostly white people, get what they need.   I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.   You're starting to piss me off.  Get out of the car.  Robert and Seth get our of the car and walk across the street.   I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.   I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.  Sketch pulls a gun and shoves it against Robert's cheek.   I have money --   I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.   Just tell me where she is.  Sketch pushes Robert back into the hall.  Sketch sees Seth lurking there.    Caroline rides in the passenger seat.  She's come out of her stupor and is now filled with ebullience.    Robert on the telephone.    How was she?    He holds the phone and doesn't say anything.   The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?   So what's it doing in Tijuana?  Javi looks Robert Wakefield squarely in the eye.  He shrugs.   Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?   That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?   Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?  Javi thinks along time before answering.   (reading his prepared speech The War on Drugs is a war on our nation's most precious resource... our children.  Sixty-eight million children have been targeted by those who perpetrate this war and protecting those children must be priority number one.  There has been progress and there have been failures, but where we have fallen short I see not a problem but an opportunity.  Robert is becoming increasingly uneasy.  He glances at the Chief of Staff who bores into him.  He looks again at his speech.  With great effort he continues.   An opportunity to correct the mistakes of the past while laying a solid foundation for the future. (a long, uncomfortable beat This takes not only new ideas, but perseverance.  This takes not only resources, but courage.  This takes not only government, but families.  Robert stops again as though the words are choking him.   I've... I've outlined a ten-point plan, representing a new bilateral effort...  He can't finish.  Everyone stares at Robert.  The crowd of reporters senses something is wrong.   I can't do this.  If there is a War on Drugs then our own families have become the enemy. How can you wage war on your own family?  He walks out of the room.  The crowd waits, expecting him to return.  Robert walks down a corridor and out of the White House.   My name is Robert.  This is my wife, Barbara.  We're Caroline's parents. We're just hear to listen.",
        "Wakefield": "From the hallway we see Robert and Barbara and Caroline having dinner.  A family tableau.  We hear Barbara talking, the murmur of the days events.  In the room, Barbara continues her dinner table thoughts.  Robert has a good deal of reading material stacked on the table.    A large, well-maintained Colonial on Mockingbird Valley Road, an upper-middle class neighborhood in the wealthy East End of Cincinnati.  Leaves fall on the Saab wagon in the driveway.    Caroline sits on the toilet in her private bathroom.  She's not going to the bathroom, it's a seat and she's wearing her pajamas.  She's reading a magazine.  The exhaust fan is on.  There are pictures of her and her friends on the walls: goofy pictures from camp, from school, a collage she's made with cutouts from magazine pictures and copy.  On the sink next to her is a little square of well-charred aluminum foil; she's done many hits.  She leans over and picks up a small piece of crack cocaine from a small pile in her soap dish.  She drops it on a clean place on the foil. She picks up a lighter and the tube of a ball point pen she's turned into a straw.  She heats the bottom of the foil.  The crack \"crackles.\"  She chases the smoke across the foil.  A huge hit.  She leans her head back, her eyes roll back, she tries to focus on the magazine, on anything, she stares up at the ceiling.  She holds it as long as she can then blows it toward the exhaust fan.  Caroline looks at her watch.  It's 7:20.  She stands suddenly, unsteadily.  She looks at herself in the mirror.  She's really high and indecisive.  She looks around wildly.  She sees the shower.  She turns it on.  She drops her pajamas.  She goes back to the foil and hits another piece of the rock, taking another really big hit.  She crushes the foil and flushes it down the toilet.  She hops in the shower.    He car pulls into the driveway.  Robert gets out.  Barbara doesn't.  He looks back at her.    Robert Wakefield steps inside his home.    It's very QUIET. He checks the mail on the hall table.    Robert stands outside her closed bathroom door.  There is nothing, then from the other side of the door, the faint sound of a lighter CLICKING.  AGAIN and AGAIN, then a   Caroline sits on the toilet.  Glamour Magazine on her lap.  She's wild-eyed and paranoid.  The exhaust fan is running.  The aluminum foil is on the sink.  The last little bit of heroin in a wax-paper bundle sits beside it.  She's listening hard for any SOUND in the house.  What she's wondering is if someone is outside the door listening.  She puts a piece of crack on the foil and listens hard once more before lighting it.  She does the hit.  And seems to feel better.  Suddenly there's a POUNDING on the door.  The VOICE of her father muffled through the solid wood.    Robert and Barbara sit at the kitchen table.    Barbara is waiting in the living room.  Robert enters.  He shakes his head then stands silently for a beat.",
        "Javier": "I had that dream again.  A long pause.   Where my mother's suffocating.  They continue to wait until there is the sound of a JET ENGINE.  It grows LOUDER as it approaches.   No.  There's no problem.  The driver hesitates a confused beat then reaches for his wallet.   Drop the package.  Put your hands behind your head.  You're under arrest.  The driver hesitates.  He starts to comply then looks at Javi and Manolo.   No, there's no mistake.  Javi motions to Manolo who cuffs both teenagers.  The driver begins spewing OBSCENITIES under his breath.  Javi puts the driver in the front of the Shadow.  Manolo follows in the moving van.   Javier Rodriguez.   An informant.    It was an anonymous tip.  Salazar looks at Javi a beat.   Yeah.   I don't know.  Something.  They start for their car.   Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.   Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.   If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.   Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again.  Everything's back to normal.   The police won't find your car.   Call this man, he'll find your car for you.   The police will tell him.  There's a beat of confusion.   Yes.  Better than filling out forms, right?  The man reaches in his wallet and offers Javier a twenty. Javi waves him off.  Javier and Manolo walk back to their squad car when two SUV's come to a stop in front of them.  Javier and Manolo exchange a look.  The doors SLAM and FOOTSTEPS approach.   If I can.   What is it you want me to do?   Does this offer include my partner?   He'll do what I say.  Salazar slides a folder across the desk.  Javier opens it and sees a black and white surveillance photo of the informant.   Then I guess I'm going by myself.   Everybody has a weakness.   But will he be house-trained?   Who?   Your new friends.   Not this time.   It's not our decision.   Stop complaining.  Nobody knows what you've been up to.  They push him out of the SUV.   Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?   He's not here.   No.  He lets her into the apartment.   I'll find him.   What the fuck are you doing? You're supposed to be at work. Look at you.  Manolo is sweaty and crazy-eyed.   Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?   Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.   We don't have an opinion on you.   The General is a man of his word.   What?   This is why Salazar is so interested in cleaning up Tijuana.  Madrigal, who's supposed to be dead, owns him. And Madrigal is making a move on Juan Obregon.  Javier calmly drives away.   We keep our mouths shut.   Where are we going?  Hughes sticks out his hand.    Where are you taking me?  The agents exchange a look.   Where?   No.   Not for me.   It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.   So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.    This is a very different proposition.  Johnson and Hughes exchange a glance.   Ten years ago Tijuana had no drug problem.  Now it is epidemic.  Ten years ago America takes a hammer to Pablo Escobar, a hammer to the Miami drug trade, and you allowed everything to move to my country. You dumped the problem at our feet. Now, drug use is epidemic.  Now, the treatment centers are full and get no state money.  They survive on donations and what they get for building doghouses to sell to the  What?  What is it?   Why does he need money?   How much?   What is he planning on telling them?    Javi drives through the streets of Tijuana.  He brakes for a stop sign and watches, trance-like, the pedestrians crossing in front of him.  As the intersection clears he remains still.  A HONK from behind brings him back and he pulls forward passing Helena Ayala who crosses going the opposite direction. We stay with her.   ...And I have the electronic serial numbers for their cellular phones. They change them every twenty-four hours but I have a contact at MexTel who can get me the new ESNs within twelve.  Javi finishes talking and sits back.  Agent Hughes shuts off the tape recorder and looks at the polygraph operator who nods approval.  Hughes and Johnson exchange a look.  They are dumbstruck.   Now that you have what you want, let's talk about how I get what I want.   You worry about getting me the things that I want.  I'll worry about myself.  There's a beat.  Javier seems discomfited.  The two agents notice this and exchange looks.   I feel like a traitor.    Anna.  Anna, please.  Let me in.  He KNOCKS again.   Come on.  You can't stay locked in your house all day.  Finally, the door cracks open.  Anna has clearly not been out of the house since the last time we saw her.   I know this is a tragedy, but you have to realize that good has come out of it.  She looks at him.   If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.   You will believe me, because it's true.    This seizure is one of the largest seizures in Mexican history...  It represents the first bilateral effort of the American DEA and the Mexican  Today I'm very proud to announce that Mexico, with the help of our American partners, is finally winning the war against narcotics trafficking.  The PRESS begins shouting questions --   I'm aware of that.   It could mean that, yes.   It's possible.   Yeah, it's possible... if you're prepared to die.",
