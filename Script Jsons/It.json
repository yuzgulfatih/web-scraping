        "Mike": "I'm sick of this, dad.  How would you feel if you were one of them?  Everyday, watching them stupidly walk into that killing pen. This isn't a normal kid's life. You won't even let me go to school.  Because I want to be in boring classes with other boring kids and draw pictures in text books and play baseball and go to dances and grind.  Eat me, townie!  Dad, it's-  Dad!  Ma'am. Ma'am.                     His father is in the hospital Ma'am!                            you, you're supposed to be  He damn well better be.  I told you who chased me there.  C'mon, Mikey. Your father needs us.  You'll be okay?  Doctors say it's inside your bones. And spreading.  I'll try.  It's my fault.  You're coming home though, right?  In case of what?  Dad, I'm responsible. You don't need to tell me some long tale about drinking and driving or safe sex. I'll take care of things-  Dad?  What truth?  What did you see?  Somebody! HELP! Let me out! Dad! Mom!    Shut up.  Stop it.  No!  You nuts?  We?  Abort? What does that mean.  Is that girl for real?  Something wrong with your friend here?  What does he mean by \"IT?\"  I know.   I've seen \"IT\" too.  There must be a window open.  This is all crazy.    Who are you guys anyway?  Just like my pa was trying to warn me the night I met you guys.  Everything dies.  It's only a matter of time one of us is found half eaten in the Barrens. Or worse.  Patrick was in one of the lockers. All the water bubbled up from there.  What?  My dad saw it near water, too.      The canal.  Unless you live way out in the sticks like I do. We have to tell the others.  I wasn't invited.  What happened. Bowers?  What?  Will knows where to find \"IT.\"  Pennywise?  Hurry!  We don't want it to tear.  It's up there isn't it?   That's where \"IT\" sleeps.  This is nothing like what it looked like from below.  Guys, the water thing.    IT's gone.  It's trying to get to you, Will. Kill it. Kill it now.  You did it, Will.  I'm so cold.                      All this water. It's still    But we beat It.    We beat the cancer.  What are you talking about?  Derry.   The clown.    It.  He's in a better place, Mikey. I know it's hard to believe. But you have to. Remember what your father always said...  We hear Arcadia's pretty amazing this time of year.",

        "Ben": "Sorry.  Ballyhoo?  Barnburner.  Thanks.    I just know `cuz we were in social studies. Together, in the same class. You know, like the constitution test, and stuff.  I fell on three boxes of donuts.  Uh, you too, Beverly. \"Stay cool.\"  I like it in here. It's--  Inspiring.    I'm reading about the history of this place. You know how many spooky things have--    You better quit, I swear.  Yes! I say yes! Okay! Copy all you want!   Ben.  Thanks for helping me.  Beverly was there?  And she stole this stuff for me?  Did she know it was for me?  Yes she does.                   What's going on in there?  My mom gave it to me so I wouldn't be late for curfew.  It's funny, `til the last week I didn't think anyone knew my name.  If he creeps in storm drains,    Who's Georgie? maybe.  I'm not.   I'm listening.        A storm drain. Crazy. Will steps out.     Oh, uh, when I first moved here I didn't have anyone to play with or anything, so I just started hanging out in the Library.  I don't know. There's just a lot of that here. Been that way since the original settlers.  Derry started as a logging camp before it was officially on any maps. 300 people signed the charter that made Derry Derry. A month later they all disappeared, without a trace.  The people, the livestock, everything that was alive.  People in neighboring settlements thought it was Indians or something but there was no sign of an attack. The only clue was a well house that was burnt down to charcoal.  It was here. Right on the corner of what's now Witcham and Jackson.  I'm sorry.    I didn't-  I don't know. It was just a way to kill time, I guess.  I'll go.  What's grey water?  Very funny, Richie.  You mean how all sorts of disasters and disappearances and stuff keeps on happening here?  The clown?  Isn't he at work?  Not someone.    Something.        There's like this spirit.  A clown.  But you adults aren't doing anything!        Hey Richie. Eat a bag of dicks.  Into one freaky looking clown you mean. That's the only form that seems to repeat.  Beverly's right. We can't always hide from them. We need to do something.        Fuck.  The house. It's our only chance!  No.   I'll go.      Guys, uh--  The front door is right there.  Eddie, what are you doing?  We can't leave him alone down there.  Guys, I hate to pile on bad news.  The only losers in town-     And that is the story of the Silver Dollar Saloon.  That clown, whatever \"IT\" is, has been around Derry doing nasty things for a long long time. The Black Spot fire. The Bradley Gang massacre. All the way back to the first settlers who disappeared.  No, no. This is far too         I don't want to see \"it\" whacked for \"Tales.\"            again. Ever.  This storm is crazy.   Like the sky's gonna fall.  How'd you escape?  If it means protecting Beverly, count me in.  Oh, fuck!  Shit, \"IT\" has a name.  No no no no no!   Guys!  Oh my God oh my God oh my God.  You think?  Not funny, Richie.  Guys. I don't think this is the best place to hang out right now.  Charge!  We're dead. So dead.      What does that even mean?       You gonna open it? Will does. Inside is a VINTAGE PENTAX CAMERA.",
        "Hanscom": "",
        "Richie": "Thought you were sick.  Is it mortal?  What was that?  Wait-!  What work?                        So long suckas! Richie flips off the school.  Kind of. I read verses. From      Then a seventh dimensional the Torah.                        door opens up and Stan here  Vogue man. It's all perfumed. I put on my 3-D glasses and it's like you're there.  Yeah right, Dorsey Coen's been living in home ec these last three weeks.  Sure they will. In a ditch. All decomposed, covered in worms and maggots and smelling like your  Ma'am.  Eddie-bear?  The Miss America of cute boys. Seriously.  C'mon Eds get your ass down here and help.  What's gray water?  Smells alright to me.  Guys--                          I overheard my mom talking to  Whatcha got there Willy boy?  Son of a--  How do you think Dorsey feels? Running around these woods with only one friggin' shoe.  Dorsey!  For what?  Shit, Eds you get within twenty feet of a peanut she has a whole herd. I don't want to think what she'll have if you come home with another kid's corpse.  Holy friggin' Moses. What happened to you?  Heads up, homeschool!  You're not the only one on Bower's shitlist.  I don't think she even knows you're alive man.  What do you think? He's handing `em the kid's shoe. It's riveting.  Takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin', huh?  You're pretty friggin' hard to miss.  If he creeps in storm drains,    Who's Georgie? maybe.  Will won't talk about it but the kid's arm got ripped clean off in a flash flood or something.  Cat got your tongue?  Why are you so quiet?            What's Chief Borton going to  Well?  So let's get outta here. Police stations always make me feel guilty of something.  Barrens? Don't fag out.  But we got a project we're working on out there.  Whoa, what's with the history project, Benny-boy?  What are you, the \"Reading      He's a regular Jordy Laforge. Rainbow\"? Stan takes a closer look.  The entire town?    Shit, maybe we could get Derry on Unsolved Mysteries!  I'm sorry.    I didn't-  It's summer, dorkus. If you're gonna kill time, do it right.  Eddie?  Will you stop with the grey water shit. You make it seem like any water we get in is like swimming in an out-house.  What are you waiting for? Why don't you get in you pussy?  I thought so.  Boys, you're ruining my sunbathing vibes with all this chitter chatter.  We already know you're crazy, Will. No judgement here.  That wasn't Georgie, that was your neighborhood sex offender making a house call.  I take it back. I'm judging all of you and you are all friggin' wackos.  Can you give me an indicator of what I'm about to walk into?  I hope it's Ed McMahon and I've just won publishers clearing house 10 million dollar sweepstakes. But if it is, you really didn't have to go through so much trouble, you could have just brought Ed to the quarry.  It's like someone slaughtered a pig in here. Or a parent.  All I'm saying is maybe there's some weirdo going around Derry dressed as a clown. You know, like the Joker in a \"Dark Knight\" comic. Some whack job who likes to dress up and kidnap kids.  I don't know. Who knows how crazy people do things, right?  What happened, homeschool?  Benny-boy, don't forget the ranch dressing.    What?  Getting laiiiid.  Only because your Mom-          You really want me to start  Cuz blood always freaks a girl out.  I didn't need to know that.  Ironic right? Something that's suppose to make kids laugh, actually being super freaky.  Home school.  When do you ever think anything is a good idea?  You want to swim?!  If we die here I just want to say that fight was friggin' awesome.  Don't count your chickens.  Eddie?                             He's afraid of dirt. Will covers Eddie's mouth as he continues to yell, \"we shouldn't be here.\" They watch anxiously as Travis and the boys feet inch uncomfortably closer to them. Then Eddie suddenly stops.    I'm not going up there.  Whatever it is, we don't want to go back in there.  You gotta a better idea?  We were attacked, Mrs. K. Travis  Well, that went well.  Welcome to the club, kid.  The point of telling us was?  I don't know, man.   That         Lumberjack.  Whatevs. It sounds like bunk to me. Didn't the guy who wrote this go insane or something?  Okay Schwarzenegger twins, simmer down. We can't even free Eddie from \"mom jail\" let alone take down some freaky shape-shifter with a mind- meld on all the adults of Derry. However, I do believe we could sell this story to \"Tales from the crypt.\"  Yeah well, the only time I've been spooked is when I'm with you jokers. I'm thinking I might be safer at home. At least I know my parents won't try to kill me.    What do you mean your dad attacked you?  Whoa whoa whoa. You don't really  And friggin do what?   In this storm?  I hope your schlong grew those 12 inches cuz you're gonna need it.  Happy bar mitzvah, Jason. Bet you didn't put this sucker on your gift list.  Uh, guys!  Something tells me we're not in Derry anymore.  You still afraid of a little grey water?  Mind equals blown right now.  What?  The worst and only bar mitzvah party you will ever have.  And that's supposed to rally us, Will?  I'm taking this fucker out.  It's miller ti--  Shit!    Now can we celebrate?  I had to mow like five hundred lawns. Stan smoked the clippings.",

Man, this is where Patrick Hockstettler went missing.  We'll never fit. We've gotta go back.  No. Guys. Wait! Please! Travis has gone insane. I'm not trying to hurt you, just...  Take me with you!

There's sixty million diseases in that stream. It's gray water.  Tell `em Will. Your dad works for the public works.  Sewer water. Pee and poop. I'm telling you guys you're splashing around in Derry's toilet.  Guys?                             Seriously. I don't know why  What's the big deal? It's just a sneaker.  Shit. This isn't good, guys. This seriously isn't good. We should go.  Guys-- Guys stop. We're gonna get in trouble.  I don't know. Disturbing evidence. Contaminating a scene. We should just mark where we found the shoe and leave an anonymous note to Chief Borton. My mom would have a major cow if she knew I was playing down here, I kid you not.  That's not funny, Richie. That's so not funny. Will, please.  Fine. You guys can do what you want but I'm going. I have no interest in seeing the muddy mangled body of  Woah, that's a lot of money. Will?  You crazy? My mom finds out I bought this stuff for myself I'll have to spend the whole weekend in the emergency room getting x-rayed.  My EpiPen Jr.?  I don't spaz. Those are allergic reactions. Life threatening allergic reactions.   Thanks, Mr. Keene.   That one was a real shit kicker.  Shit Stan, what happened to you? You look like you've seen a ghost.  Yeah.  I think he means you, Big Ben.  Guys, you think whoever kidnapped Dorsey might of, I dunno... got Georgie too?  Will's little brother. Or was. Before your time.  Why are you so quiet?            What's Chief Borton going to  What did he say?  Later days.  What are you, the \"Reading      He's a regular Jordy Laforge. Rainbow\"? Stan takes a closer look.  Jesus.                          Holy fuck.  Hey, isn't that where Will's brother, Georgie-  Screw that.  Ben, with those cuts you have on your chest, I'm not sure if getting in this water-  Haunted how?  Like.   In your dreams?  Oh God. Oh God.  There was a lot of blood.  Only us kids can see it.  How? We don't even know what      That's a good name for it it is that we're looking for.     actually.   On what?  It makes sense though. If it's killing kids. A clown is the perfect cover.  They're going to cream him.  I don't think that's a good idea.  Really guys, there has to be another option.  I'm serious. This house-- Shut up, Eddie.      We shouldn't be here!  There's something I didn't tell you guys.  This house. I saw something here once. I thought it was just my mind playing tricks, but now I know...  I saw \"IT.\"    Shit. Guys, look.  Guys?  Get me out of here.  What do you mean you can't get down stairs?  I- I think I broke my arm.  No. No no no. Will?     Help me!  Hurry, guys!  This isn't happening. This isn't happening.  Go away!  No.         Please Claude, I just got married last month.            No.   Feels fine I guess.  I'm not allowed to see them.  My Mom thinks they're the reason I got hurt. She says I'm sensitive and they don't take care of me like she does.  Yeah. Mom says I should always carry my Epi-pen with me, in case I ever have an episode.     Not me, momma... You.  He said I was never allergic until you made me start carrying around my Epi-pen. You put those allergies in my head.  Then why did you send my friends away?  You lied to me mamma. You've been giving me medicine that's not really medicine.  This is what's going to happen now.  I'm going out that door and you won't stop me. I'm going to my friend Stan's bar-mitzvah and when I come home you're never going to tell how weak or sick or delicate I am ever again.  Guess I'm not as weak as I thought.  You guys, if \"IT\" can take over Beverly's parents, why not the rest of ours?  What do you mean?  Wait, count you in to what?  Oh my God oh my God!  Dorsey's other shoe.  Hurry.  Don't get too close to the edge, Will.  You still wear diapers at night?  It's in our head. All the stuff we see. It's like the allergies my mom said I had. We make it real.  Stan? Stan, are you okay?       Stan! He stares blankly ahead, as if his mind was wiped blank.  Stanley, snap out of it.  What do you mean?  Because we'll taste better.  Did we kill it?  I'm so cold.                      All this water. It's still    Well Richie mostly.",

Too late.  Have you been seeing \"things\" Will?  I need to show you guys something.  My Daddy will kill me if he finds out I had boys in our apartment.  Sometimes he comes home for a nap.  My Daddy?    Mean. Like a drunk.      In there.  You'll see.  You really see it?  The sink. It came out from the sink. My parents couldn't see it. I thought I was going crazy.            Or blood in my sink?          I am now.    Thanks to you guys.  Not someone.    Something.        There's like this spirit.  But we're not lying.  Nice stick, Richie.     How about this.  I think it depends.  Wow, you really don't know shit about girls do you?  \"IT\" showered me in blood because I just got my period... and...  Adults just ignore them. But kids, like your brother, Georgie...  That's cowardly, Stan.  Woah!  Will, we need cover--  Rock, paper, scissors?  It's just a scrape.  What is it Eddie?  What exactly did you see here, Eddie?  What's happening?!  We have to do something.  Follow me!  I don't know, Richie.  That can't be true.   We just saw  I think it's pretty obvious.      Derry's not just haunted,  We hurt it at Neibolt.   That's gotta mean something.  He's just scared.          My friend's party. I told ma--  No one.  I know daddy.  They're my friends, daddy.  I-- I swear. They're just friends.  I'm a good girl daddy. Good, just like you raised me.   It's nothing, daddy.   Just a poem.  I told you I don't have one.  Daddy stop. You're hurting me.  Nothing. Please, daddy. You don't have to worry. I promise. Please!  What?  Daddy, please.  No. No I'm not.  No.   My daddy. He... he...  I don't know. I don't know if it was him, or...  I think \"IT\" was there, controlling him, I don't know, I can't go back, I can't go back, Will. I don't know  It was like that lumberjack Ben told us about. The one from the Silver Dollar. He had this look. Like someone was pushing him to do it.  I can't go back there guys. He'll kill me. Or worse.  Now what?  Take off your shoes. You'll be fine. Just move real real slow.   Guess I'm going first again?  The water. There's something in the water with us.  Stan? Stan, are you okay?       Stan! He stares blankly ahead, as if his mind was wiped blank.  Break into our homes, we break into yours.  Will, it's a trick.  Finish him, Will. For all of us. For Georgie.  Guys, stop it. Focus.  Will?  We all pitched in.  Take some pictures for us."
