        "Ray": "steps out of the shadows. Julie practically faints.   I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?   Yeah.   Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.   Hey, I'm sorry. You're right. Are you ready to go? I've got the old truck. You know the drill...Crab boil at Ollie's. Croaker Queen Pageant...It's only small-town fun, but it's still nice. People really miss you. I miss you.  She looks at Ray, his compassionate demeanor. This is hard to say --   Can't what?   I understand something.   I have to work, Julie. My boat's in Southport, remember? But, I get it. You need your space from Craokerland. And maybe from me, too.  Ray starts walking away.   You know where to find me.   It's okay. I'm just gonna go.  Julie follows him out to the road. A group of LAUGHING STUDENTS block her way.    Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.   No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...   What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.  Dave's interest is piqued.   This weekend?  Dave is watching Ray closely. Ray's expression hardens.    You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?    Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.   Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.   Stupid. Stupid.   You wanna see what I've been thinking?  He holds up the box and slowly opens it. Dave is stunned.   I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.    The music's even LOUDER in here. The mood is high...Two buddies going to propose to a girl. Dave adjusts the radio to another AM station --    its HAZARDS blinking.  Ray slows and creeps past the car. The driver's door is open. It appears EMPTY.   No.   Maybe not.  He throws open his door.    Hey! Buddy, what's up?  The body doesn't move.    and behind Dave, in the other car, a FIGURE IN A SLICKER sits up in the back seat and gets out of the car.  Ray continues toward the body.      SLICKER FIGURE moves toward the unsuspecting Dave.    Dave watches Ray in the road. He leans across the seat and rolls up Ray's window.  Behind him, the SLICKER FIGURE gets closer, moving to the passenger side of the truck.   Hey, can you hear me?  Ray reaches toward the body...    Something FLASHES IN THE SIDE-VIEW MIRROR.    ...Dave?  There's no answer from dead Dave. Ray tries to see around the headlights. He moves slowly toward the truck.  The BRIGHTS and FOGS come on, blinding Ray. The truck's engine REVS. The truck rolls a few inches, adjusting a bead on Ray.  Then, tires spinning, the truck launches straight at Ray.  Ray runs at the truck. AT THE LAST MINUTE, he ducks behind the parked car.  HIS TRUCK goes SCREAMING past.  Ray backs around the car --    jumps off the edge of the road. His TRUCK SLAMS INTO THE BARRIER RIGHT   Ray falls through the air. Lands hard on his leg. Tumbles down the hill, finally stopping with a crash. He lies motionless at the bottom of a ravine.   I need an international operator.   How much?   How much?  Mac looks around his shop at the usual jumble of crap: vacuum cleaners, golf clubs, guitar amps...   Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.   I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.  Mac barely hasitates, he knows he's getting a steal --   Is it loaded?  Mac shakes his head.   Load it.  Off Mac's sadness at young people today.   I'll keep that in mind.   I need to get to Tower Bay Island.  Paulsen senses something isn't right.   I need to get there, now.  Paulsen looks at him standing there drenched.   I'm not looking for a weather report, I'm looking for a boat. So which one's yours?    Come in...This is Summer Breeze requesting emergency assistance for Tower Bay island. I repeat...This is Summer Breeze...  Ray guns the boat away.   Let go of her! Now!  Ben and Will spin to see    like the hero from a western, step out from behind a tree.  Ben starts to laugh. Will joins him.   Let her go. Now.  Ray raises the .38 caliber handgun. He COCKS the hammer.  Ben doesn't let go of Julie. Lightning fast, he slaps his hook back on and gets the point to Julie's neck.   Stop right there.  Ray's finger squeezing down the trigger.    Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?    Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.  She sees the love in his eyes. She hugs him.   It's gonna be great.    Checking the locks again?",
        "Bronson": "",
        "Brooks": "What can I do for you?    Ah, yes. Roll out the red carpet. Our contest winners are here at last.  He scans a sheet as Tyrell stares at the pit bull.   Not really. I've found peices of guys like you in his stool.  Tyrell is put off by this aggressive comment.    I don't have a problem in the world.    Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --   It'll outlive you, I'm sure.  Creepy thing to say. Slides a registration form.   Wilson comma Karla... (sees something on the form Oh --   You're in 201 and 202.    Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.  Tyrell wraps his arms around Karla. Julie looks uncomfortably towards Will.   Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?   And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.   July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.   It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.  And Brooks turns away through the office door. They walk toward their rooms. Will catches up with them.   I don't find this at all funny.  Julie steps in -- stares into the empty closet. She can't believe her eyes.  She searches their faces, looking for someone to believe her.   I knew you people were goining to be trouble. I knew from the first time I laid eyes on you.  Julie grabs Brooks by his robe.   Who? Who is here?  She doesn't know where to start. Nancy pokes her head around the door.    In the morning we'll talk to Derrick, the \"dockhand guy,\" and put the whole thing to rest.  Now, let's slow down on the Dark and Stormies and get some sleep.    Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.   'Tis the season, like I told you. It's a big one.  Julie goes for the phone.   Phones went down a few minutes ago.  She picks up the phone, listens, then dangles it from her hand.   Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.   Sorry. Emergencies only.   I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.  And Brooks is gone. Outside the window, it starts to rain. There's a CLAP of thunder.    They burst into the middle of the room before seeing that Brooks's head has a machete sticking out of it.",
        "Doctor": "Yes, but he seemed certain his friend was killed out on the highway by somebody named Ben Willis.  He said he has a hook on his hand. He said he was driving a BMW.  As the cop stares at him deadpan, the doctor realizes how rediculous this must sound.    He suffered a severe head trauma --",
        "Estes": "201 and 202...Who put you in...?  Don't use these much --   No real reason.  Pretty fancy rooms for kids your age.   Oh, yeah? What you have to do?   Ahh, good for you, girl.  ...And, where would you like me to put the bags?  A beat as Julie and Karla exchange a look. Then, Karla tosses one of the keys to Julie.   No, I've been doing this since before you were a dream in your father's eye.  Estes grabs the bags and takes them into the room. Julie and Will are left staring at each other.   Brasilia.  She jumps out of her skin. Estes was standing right there in the shadows.   That's the capital of Brazil, not Rio.  Karla SCREAMS.  Tyrell comes flying across the lobby past Karla. He dives on Estes, tackling him to the floor. Will is right behind him.   Let go. I got him. That's me. It's him. We got you...   No --   No --  They shake Estes, finally giving him a chance to speak.   I found the bodies this morning...I tried to use the radio, but he already destroyed it.   I haven't hurt anyone...I stole those things to help you. To protect you.    I know who you're talking about. He used to work here at the hotel.  And I've seen him around again. Out in the woods by the orchard.  They look at Estes...Is he telling the truth?   I can't remeber his name, but I don't forget a face.  I can show you...  They stare a beat --   Where else you gonna go, son?  They look to the office, the gym...The sense of death surrounding them.   He worked here for many years. He had a nice family. A pretty wife and two little ones. A boy and a girl. They'd be about your age, now.  They continue along the path.  Estes looks at them in the dark, slowing for just a second.   One day his wife went missing. Maid found blood all over the honeymoon suite -- Room 201.  There are strange NOISES out in the woods.   Eventually, they found her body. Pieces. A leg in the swamp. An arm washed up on Three Mile Beach.  And the head they found much later.  A huge branch is blown from a tree and comes crashing down through the underbrush, scaring them. Estes calmly steps around it.   Careful --   People say she was running around on him. People say he caught her in bed with other men. People say a lot of things.  He disappeared, taking the two small ones with him. At least they were never found.  The winding path leads to a small orchard. They hang on his every word.   We're here.  In the center of the orchard is a cemetery.  They move off the path into the safety of the woods. There seems to be activity around the place. It's silent and eerie.  Julie stares, fascinated. She is slowly drawn toward the house. Karla grabs for her arm.   This has to end. Now.   Will...He's in on it. He's --  Suddenly Estes's expression changes to surprise, and",
        "Will": "Julie! Wait! You okay?   You sure?   You don't seem fine.  Julie realizes this is true.   The shower again?    I'm sorry.   It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.   It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.    To get out of Southport?   Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?   Are you sure?  She touches his face affectionately.   Um...Okay. Bye.  Will walks away. Julie watches him a beat, then turns down her walk --    This was not my idea.   I said, this...Do you want a drink?  Will looks down at his feet. He and Julie stand there not quite knowing what to do.   How about a drink?  Will is a few steps ahead as they move for the bar. Julie seems to be relaxing, having a good time. Then, she looks up into the balcony and sees, in a strobe light's FLASH --    You okay?  She's chalk white and crestfallen. Her whole affect is \"Will I ever have a normal time?\" She drifts amay toward the stairs to the balcony.   Hey Julie?  Will catches Karla and Tyrell's eyes. They're worried.   Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...   What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.    Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.   Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.  Tyrell shakes his head.   You just gotta breathe.  Tyrell is trying to keep from puking --    See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.  PAULSEN, the BOAT CAPTAIN, overhears as he passes --    Hey, Tyrell, we found you brother.   No, thanks.   And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.   Forward! A girl needs time to make up his mind.  Julie, look, if it's cool, I'll sleep on the couch and they can have their own room to practice for that real honeymoon.  But Tyrell grabs Karla and drags her into the room. We here GIGGLES.   I'll take those.   You sure it's okay with you?   You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.  She laughs and they go into the room.   We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.   The guy at the desk said the place would be quiet, not dead.   So why are you still here?   Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!  KARLA &amp; JULIE I'll drink to that!  They drink and toast again.   Come on, it'll be fun.   Julie? What's wrong?   What do you mean, Julie?    who YELLS and drops the flowers and champagne he was holding. The bottle bursts and covers them with spray.   It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...  She grabs a TOWEL off the bathroom door, trying to help him clean up the mess.   I scared you -- I crossed the line --   Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.   I just really like you and I want you to feel good about everything...You know? I want you to be happy.  He hands the rose to her. There's a moment between them. He reluctantly heads for the door.    Dork.  Passing Karla and Tyrell's room on his way down the hall, Will spots the DO NOT DISTURB SIGN.  He hears an INCREDIBLE POUNDING from inside. He shakes his head and mopes down the hall.    How's the water?   Ahh, that feels great.   Alone. In the room.  Got any advise?   What? What are you talking about? Where?    Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.   Leave her alone.  Angry at her boyfriend, Karla gets out of bed and joins Julie.   You don't have to be a jerk.  Karla pulls Julie close in a show of support for her friend whose mind everyone believes has been inventing dead bodies.    They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.  Will's voice echoes across the lobby. Tyrell is maybe a little nervous, but hiding it.    Hello?  There's nobody here, Tyrell.  Tyrell's already out the front entrance.    You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --    I don't like to fish.  Tyrell moves across the grounds. He looks back. Will is stopped in his tracks, looking up at --    looks in at the dog angrily charging the chain-link. He looks up at Tyrell.   Come on. Jump. I've got you.  He reaches out to try and catch Tyrell.   And do what with it?  Tyrell breaks another bottle in half.   That's chlorine and muriatic acid. Put the two together and you get cyanide.  Tyrell rolls over on his back next to Will, practically coughing up a lung.   Julie!   Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?  They look at Julie. Their escape is cut off by water. They're scared.   The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --   He's not here.  Tyrell and Will begin roughly searching through Estes's possessions.   Let's go.   We'll only be a second, okay?   Let go. I got him. That's me. It's him. We got you...   We found your voodoo crap --   How do we know you're not setting us up?   Where'd Estes go?   I'll go find him.   He's probably the only one who can help us.   It's okay. He couldn't have gone far. I'll catch up with you later.  Will disappears into the darkness.   Hey Estes.  Estes? Where'd you go?  Estes doesn't answer right away -- he keeps his back to Will.   You abandoning us? How come you didn't tell us you had a boat?  Estes picks up the boat's oar. He speaks low, almost inaudibly.   What -- ?  Estes swings the oar, cracking Will's head hard.    enters the hallway and continues toward them.    pokes his head through. He's clutching a piece of wood as a weapon.   It's you guys, thank god. Is everyone okay?  They are ecstatic to see him. They bound up the concrete stairs --   Come on. We're gonna be okay.   Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.   I guess so.  Julie points out that his chest and stomach are covered in blood, too.   When I was coming back I saw your slicker friend looking for you guys down by the water.  Let's hurry and get inside...   You'll be okay. It's over.  Karla and Nancy rush from the bar. Julie looks tenderly at Will. He looks back at her. She pulls some hair off his forehead. He smiles weakly.   That's because it's not my blood.  The slow change in Julie as she realizes...  She starts to run. Will roughly grabs her.   It's time you woke up, Julie.  His voice switches to that of a familiar radio disk jockey.      standing there holding a spear gun.  Estes topples over on top of Nancy, pinning her underneath his dying, convulsing body. Nancy struggles to get loose.   Look at the bright side, Jules. We finally get to spend some quality time together.  Julie's trying to get to the knife she's stashed in her back pocket.   Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.   We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.  They come into the orchard. They are covered in mud. Julie stumbles again. Goes to her knees. Works the knife free and slashes up at Will. She slices him across the face.  He steps back, feels the blood.   What'd you have to do that for?  There is a creepy pause. Will stares at his own blood. She catches her breath...  Then suddenly, Will knocks the knife from her hand. He lifts her by the hair. Enraged, he puches her in the face. She goes down.   Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.  He shoves her. She falls backward into the arms of Ben Willis.   Hi, Dad.  Julie WAILS, struggling wildly in Ben's grasp.   You gotta be kiddin' me.   We haven't missed you down here, Ray boy. I got to know Julie real well.  Will gets the better of Ray. He's stronger. He yanks him up -- choking him. Ray is begging to check out.   Think of all the things I'm gonna do to her.  Dad, finish him.  Ben charges toward Ray's back. He pulls back the hook for a roundhouse slashing --  At the last second, Ray dips, elbows Will.",
        "Benson": "",
        "Paulsen": "That's too bad, too, because it's the only way on or off the island.  Unless you have an accident. And then they call the Coast Guard.  Julie and Karla have rejoined the men.    Yep. That's what the tourists pay for -- sun, sea, and solitude.   Few more minutes.  We move off the boat and REVEAL the island. The intrepid vacationers excitedly take in the island.    I'm at your service, Princess.   If Marine Radio's right about the weather, you're already out of time.  He hangs a SIGN at the end of the gangplank. It reads: LAST DEPARTING   A gear-strewn office. Paulsen watches an episode of Party of Five. There is a loud KNOCKING at the door.   What the...  Paulsen slowly gets up. He cracks the door open. Ray stands silhouetted against the rain.   We're closed.  Ray pushes his way in --   Did you happen to notice what's going on outside?  Ray pulls out the gun and points it at Paulsen --",
        "Julie": "A little older, a little wiser, yet still very pretty, no doubt. But she's all alone in the house of the Lord.  And those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy burden still rests upon her soul.  She reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a curtained  Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.  It's been a year since my last confession...  Julie swallows hard. This is difficult for her.   I've never told anyone this. Not my mom, not the poice, not even my friends -- except for the ones who were there and they...well they're not around anymore. You see I...I...   I killed a man. Well, I thought I had...then...  She balks at the memory of it. The priest bows his head in the shadows of the other side.    You've got to understand...It was all an accident. A terrible accident. It's been a whole year. I've tried to get past this, but I just can't.   I have these dreams...horrible dreams. And this man is always there with me.   You see, he was a killer. He murdered Helen and Barry, and he would have killed me too, if I hadn't...gotten away with it.  I don't know, I guess I just need to deal with the fear, the guilt...to finally say his name. Ben Willis. His name was Ben Willis...  The confession is cathartic for Julie. She looks relieved until,   You know? But how could you...  Clouds of icy steam shoot through the partition. Julie moves closer to the screen, trying to get a better look.   I'm sorry --  Julie grabs her stuff and bolts.   I'm fine.   I'm fine.   I had another dream, Will.  Will takes this seriously.   It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.   I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.   It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.  BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EXPLOSIONS. Julie jumps out of her skin. It's just STUDENTS letting off FIRECRACKERS as they fly past on bicycles.  Will and Julie are now thinking the same thing.    It was one year ago...    I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.    Right. Now I remember.  He smiles at her. She smiles back. They stop in front of her apartment building.   Are you getting out of town on the fourth?   I'm okay.   Thanks for the talk, Will. You're good to me.  Will stands there akwardly --   Oh, my god, Ray. You scared me.  Recovering, she hugs Ray, genuinely glad to see him. He's a bit cold.   Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.   Ray, we're just friend.   Why are you being like this?  It should be obvious Ray feels insecure in the college environs, but they're miscommunicating.    Ray, I can't...   I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...  Ray is cold. This is what he's expected all along.   It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.  Ray is hurt and confused.   Hey, why don't you stay up here? They have fireworks over the river. And...there's a million things to do.   Ray? Ray? At least come up for a while.  Ray keeps on walking.   Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...  I'm just scared...that's all.  But Ray is already gone. Julie stares after him a beat, then turns quickly to her door. She clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the walk alone. She nervously pulls her keys. A can of mace dangles from the keychain.     Students throw FRISBEE in the street. Ray walks to his old truck, which is wedged between a new Sport Utility and a BMW.  He clambers into the front seat. He thinks. Then, digs into his pocket and pulls out the unmistakable shape of an ENGAGEMENT RING BOX. He throws it in the glove box, starts the truck and drives away.    Julie opens the door and steps inside. She locks three deadbolts. She stands there, alone, listening to the SILENCE. She doesn't even have a cat. A faucet DRIPS in the kitchen.    The faucet DRIPS. Julie turns the handle. No success. She checks the lock on each window. She stands for a moment.  She picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful. She opens the fridge and takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce. She grabs a soft drink and a jar of bread-and-butter pickles. She gets some cookies from a shelf. She thinks. Opens the freezer, pulls out some fat-free sorbet.  She takes the whole mess toward her bedroom.    She hits the light switch. A bedside light goes on. It's a sparsely furnished room. The bed is pilled high with pillows. She checks the windows, then climbs into bed with the food.  On the bedside table are pictures of family and friends. She looks at one of Helen and Barry. She looks around the room. It's depressing.  Outside we hear young people having fun, slamming car doors, going places. She picks at the food, then puts it on the table. She turns off the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the room.    Julie, sound asleep, is curled into fetal position on the bed.  There's a CLICK in the front hall. And ANOTHER.  Julie's eyes shoot open. She listens. Another SOUND, almost like the front door being CLOSED.  Her arm reaches for the bedside light. She hits the switch. The bulb   Okay. Okay. Face your fears...  She gets off the bed and stands still.    There's nothing...  There's another NOISE down the hall.    Quiet.  Julie silently scoots out of her bedroom toward the kitchen.    She gets a large KNIFE. She listens. It sounds like somone's in the living room. She steps through the kitchen door.  As she moves we see a shadow pass the other way down the hallway toward her bedroom.    There's NO ONE there.   Okay, calm down, imagination.  She relaxes until she sees that her front door is slightly AJAR, light from the hallway slanting through.   I can't take this anymore. I can't.  Holding the knife in front of her, she tiptoes to the hallway. There's a soft RUSTLING coning from her bedroom. She gets a flashlight out of a drawer and starts down the hallway.    Let's just do it.  She moves faster toward her bedroom. she listens outside the doorway. It sounds like someone's in the closet. She moves into the room.    There's a noise in the darkened closet. Julie moves into position.  She turns the flashlight ON and lunges for the closet.   What are you doing in my closet?  They hug, jumping up and down with relief.   What are you doing in my closet?   That was heart attack time, Karla.   I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.   I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.   There's nothing between Will and me.   No I'm not.  Karla holds up another dress for Julie -- strapless, sexy, the one.   Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.   No.   Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --   (suspicious, but having fun Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?   What?   Ben...  The stranger turns around. It's only a club kid in a tacky vinyl raincoat and hat. She's shaken.    With morning sun filtering through her blinds, Julie wakes up to the strange sound of THUMPING. She gets out of bed and slowly exits the room.    The noise gets louder as she heads down the hall.    That could break the machine.    The number's unlisted...   Okay, okay. You're right.    ...South America...Carnival...   Magic 96.7!  Julie hangs up and joins Karla dancing on the couch.   Hi.  Ray is happy to hear her voice, but cautious.    No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --   It's okay.  Dave holds up two wriggling snappers. He dances them toward each other in a puppetlike mating ritual, making KISSING SOUNDS and narrating --   Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.   We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...   It's not you, it's Southport. And it's the Bahamas! And it's free!  Karla is watching Julie.   Ray, come on. I want us to be together.  Ray thinks. Dave looks at him like he's crazy.   Will you try...for me, please?  Dave moves one of the fish like it's been shot through the heart.   Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.  She hangs up and Karla sits next to her.    Karla exits the building. She watches Julie sitting on the curb.  A truck turns onto the street. Julie looks hopeful, but -- it's not Ray.  Karla approaches her friend.   He's not coming. I thought he was just...   But, he said he'd try.    He does work hard.   Then, don't.  A Jeep Cherokee stops, and an ebullient Tyrell steps out wearing shorts and a Hawaiian shirt.   Oh!    You know what? This rocks. We're going to the Bahamas!  Will is relieved.   Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.   Deep breaths --   You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.    I'm the King of the World.    I will, and you remind me of the same thing.  They throws their arms around each other and stare into the horizon.   It's pretty remote here.   Where is everyone? I'll ask --  Julie turns to consult the maid.    It sure is a beautiful old hotel.   Your what?   We haven't exchanged anything.   Storm season?   It beets being on the mainland.    Why's that?  He sees their happy, expectant faces and changes the subject.   Karla! You promised.    Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.   Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --    I miss Ray...I tried to call him.  Karla looks at her. She's sincere, but firm.    I'm Julie. This is Karla.    backs into something, turns and gasps -- it's a statue of an OLD WHALER, complete with HARPOON, WHITE BEARD, and YELLOW SLICKER.  She doesn't let Karla see that it upset her.  Nancy puts their drinks down in front of them.   Don't even think about it.   No way.   No.   Not me...no way...   You asked for it.  Song number thirty-nine.  Tyrell nods and punches a few buttons. Julie takes the stage as sappy strings begin to swell. She looks at the MONITOR, then melodramatically at the crowd, and begins to sing -- no, BELT -- Gloria Gaynor's \"I WILL SURVIVE.\"    First I was afraid...I was petrified...   Will stands, clapping. Tyrell pounds his chest. Karla flips up her LIGHTER, swaying like a hard-core fan. And Julie continues, crooning out the chorus as the beat kicks in and the gang begins to dance.    I will survive...I will survive...   (singing -- then trailing off And I still know...what you did... last summer...  Her voice trails. Her smile abruptly fades.    trembling, shaking, a mess. Will jumps onstage.   It's...him.   He did something to the screen...it, it, said...  Julie loos at the screen -- the normal lyrics are still scrolling. She suddenly feels their eyes upon her. They're looking at her like she's having a nervous breakdown.   Nothing. Nothing, I'm sorry...  Stung, she rushes off the stage.    Julie steps into her room. Closes the door behind her. She falls back against it, trying to calm herself down.   There's no way...just stop it right now...  She looks around the cozy room.   Closet. Bed. Bathroom. No need to panic.  Julie starts to undress, get ready for bed, the day of travel finally catching up with her. She grabs something to sleep in. Tosses it on the bed. And that's when she sees it,    Oh, Will! I'm sorry.   No, no, no. This was really sweet...   No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.   Are you sure? I really appreciate it.  He picks up a rose. Most of its petals on the floor.    Ray is at a telephone booth up the street from Julie's apartment.  He looks exausted. Blood seeps through his shirt. He's in pain.    The DOOR CREAKS OPEN once again to her room. And from a STRANGER'S POV   Will...?  No reply.    She steps out of the bathroom, crossing toward the door.   Will?  No answer. She peers through the PEEPHOLE.   Is that you?  She unlocks and opens it. Nobody there.  Julie quickly closes the door and relocks it, her heart rate just begining to rise again as...  KLUNK-KLUNK. She hears it again. Then, the sound STOPS. But standing at the door -- she realizes that's not where it came from. Her eyes immediately go to...   It's happening again! There's a body!  Will cathes her in his arms and she sobs uncontrollably.   It's in my room!  They can see she's not fooling around.    Everyone is gathered in the center of Julie's room. Julie is held tight by Will. Brooks, the hotel manager, conducts the investigation.  Brooks approaches the closet door. Julie holds her breath. He throws it open. A long beat.   There was a body! I swear it!    I wasn't dreaming.   Listen to me. He's here.    I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.   The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.   I want off this island.   Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.   It's dead.  An exasperated Brooks heads for the door.    looks out the window with glazed-over eyes.   Some.  Tyrell glares at Julie by the window. Sees the incredible rain.   It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.   Nice move.   Cancer in a box.   Houseplant.  Karla opens the canopy of the tanning bed.   Karla!   You say something?  Nothing. And just as Julie lies down again, Karla's frantic SCREAMS echo down the hall.  Julie goes to push open the canopy. As she does, the CANOPY LID is JAMMED DOWN ON TOP OF HER. A CHAIN shoots through the handles. Julie is locked on the grill.   Karla! Somebody? Hey, this isn't funny.  Suddenly the lights go off. Julie thrashes around, trying to free herself.    She sees someone walking around in the room. The person steps closer. Julie could almost reach out and touch him.  She begins to SCREAM!   Oh, God, get me out. Get me out.  Will struggles to open the bed, but the chain holds strong.  Tyrell grabs a nearby dumbbell.    I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here... (already moving for the door We've got to get to the radio and call for help.    We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.   Ben Willis.   They never found the body.  Her voice is low and urgent, an impromptu confessional.   Two summers ago. We lied to the authorities. We hit Ben Willis with our car. Ray, me, Barry, and Helen ...We threw the body in the water to cover it up --   Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.  Tyrell begins backing away from Julie. He picks up a piece of driftwood from the dock.   I thought Ray and I killed him on the boat, but we didn't and now he's back to finish up the job.  Tyrell holds up the log as a weapon. He's angry and afraid --    It's not him.   Voodoo.   Leave him alone.  Tyrell holds up battered Estes --   Let him go. I believe him.   He's telling the truth. He could've easily killed me. He didn't. (beat while this sinks in Look, we didn't even answer the radio question right...This whole thing was a setup.   Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.   I don't know.    How do we know you're not?   We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.    Did he do it?   I've got to see.  She leads, they follow, circling the house. Julie rounds a corner of the shack and stops. She sees --   born September 6, 1979 died July 4, 1998 \"A Lying Whore\"  \"A Lying Whore\" is scratched with a knife.   I'm not dying on this island, Will.  Do you hear me?  Julie shouts into the darkness.   You want me, Ben Willis? Come and get me. I'm right here.  She kicks over her headstone --   My grave stays empty!  She looks defiantly down the path.   Then, we fight --  Will looks around. Estes is gone.    Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.   I'm so sorry. I brought this on everyone. It's my fault.  Tyrell picks up on the mood swing. He moves closer to them. He's sympathetic.    move down an aisle behind him.  Tyrell ducks around to the second aisle. He slices the air, ready to pounce. This aisle is empty.    nervously move another aisle down.  Tyrell moves stealthily toward the third aisle...This is it. He lunges forward into the row...Empty, also.  There's a small SOUND...A MOUSE scampers off under the shelves. Tyrell turns and smiles at Karla and Julie --     Wait, it's Nancy --  Nancy, the bartender steps out of the shadows brandishing her rolling pin.   Get used to it.   There's no way to lock it.   You sick freak.  Ben suddenly whirls and lunges at Karla. He grabs her, but they both lose their balance, teetering for a moment on one of the beams, before falling --  They CRASH through the mirror --    and Ben advancing toward Karla, whose back is against the railing.  Karla looks behind her, sees    Karla!  Ben turns and looks up at Nancy and Julie. Then, he sprints from the balcony.  Julie and Nancy duck back into the attic.    A powerful BOLT OF LIGHTNING cracks. Fills the room with a pulse of bright light. BEN IS STANDING INSIDE AND HE'S HEADING STRAIGHT FOR   He's inside.  Karla spins. Sees him. Her terrified scream blends with the cranes, now SHRIEKING VIOLENTLY.   Come on...   Nancy...    No way!!  Julie smashes the glass with her elbow. Grabs the axe.    Move!  Julie hammers the door with the axe. Wood splinters. Glass cracks.  Ben is almost on top of Karla now.  Julie swings. The axe breaks the glass, pulls the frame out. Julie drops the axe. They grab Karla. Pull her through.  Ben swings. The hook rips Karla's shoe, but Julie and Nancy pull her through.  Julie and Ben are face to face. Julie has the axe in her hands. She stares him down.   Come on, gimme a shot --  Ben rips off his hook, eyeing Julie.   Come on, you can make it.  Julie gets in, pulling Karla in behind her. They pull the door closed behind them.   I'm right here. Grab my hand.   Okay. I'm at the bottom. Karla, just get my hand.   No, you're not.   All right --  The iron hatch is slowly opening. Julie gets the axe into possition --   Did you get help?  Will shakes his head. He's walking woozily.   What happened?   He's in it with Willis?   Your stomach, you're hurt --  Will looks down, clutches himself, and keeps moving.   Oh, my god, you're bleeding to death.  She looks back towards Nancy --   We need a first-aid kit.   Will, just hold on. We'll get you fixed up.   You've got blood everywhere, but I can't find the wound.  Will takes her head in his hands, looks her in the eye.   Why are you doing this to me?   I trusted you.   ...Why?    No, no, no --  Ben pulls off his hook and strokes Julie's cheek with his stump.    stands behind him holding the gun.   Just...Die.  BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. She empties the gun into Ben, who flies backward into Julie's grave.  As he tumbles, Ben releases the dirt stacked beside the grave...   You're okay. Thank god.    We don't have to tell anyone it rained the whole time. It can just be our little secret.  The three of them throw their arms around each other's shoulders and they start walking for the beach as...   Ray...what are you doing?   Never do that again.   I love it here.   You know me to well.  Julie smile and walks to the bedroom.   What is my problem?  She sits down on the bed.  We see her bare feet from under the bed.  She smiles, relaxes. She looks in the mirror leaning against the wall. Something has caught her eye. She freezes. She turns slowly back to the reflection in the mirror. She sees the glint of steel --",
        "James": "A little older, a little wiser, yet still very pretty, no doubt. But she's all alone in the house of the Lord.  And those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy burden still rests upon her soul.  She reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a curtained  born September 6, 1979 died July 4, 1998 \"A Lying Whore\"  \"A Lying Whore\" is scratched with a knife.",
        "Ben": "enters the hallway and continues toward them.    Nancy appears in the opening and throws a brick down at Ben. It hits him in the chest and knocks him back.  Julie makes it into the attic. They pull the ladder up behind them like a drawbridge.    You'd be amazed by what you'd see. My wife with every man on the island, for example.  And you, sexy...I loved watching you.    standing there holding a spear gun.  Estes topples over on top of Nancy, pinning her underneath his dying, convulsing body. Nancy struggles to get loose.   That's my boy.  Ben holds her back to look at her. He throws back the hood of his slicker. We see his face clearly for the first time.   Shush, now. No more screaming...No more running. Time to die.   What're you gonna do, boy? Call us names?   Think about it, boy. You're no killer.  That's my job.  Ray hesitates, his finger on the trigger. He does look scared.  Ben takes a step toward Ray. Then another, pushing Julie in front of him. Will moves closer, too.   You don't have it in you.  Suddenly, Will dives for Ray. Ray gets a shot off, tagging Ben in the shoulder. The gun goes flying.  Julie spins and hits Ben in the face. He knocks her into her own grave...Mud begins to slide in on her. She tries to scramble out.  Will and Ray wrestle, punching each other repeatedly in the face.  Will has Ray down and his hands around his kneck. He looks him in the eye.   Gonna blind you first.  The hook is touching the eyelid --   You can't kill me.  His face is completely covered. His mouth still moving.   I'll always be with you.  The dirt covers him. It continues to fill, until just the",

        "Dave": "Hey, Ray...phone!  Ray takes the phone.    Julie, I love you. I know I'm only a humble fish, but if you really look at it, you're a fish, too.  Oh, Ray, you're right...Do me like a snapper.  Hey, something smells like fish...  Ray waves him away, concentrating on his call.   Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.  Karla is watching Julie.   Man, what is your problem? We haven't caught anything for days. Pull the big ugly stick out of your butt. She asked you to go to the Bahamas! Man, you gotta go. We'll both drive up. I got friends I can see up there.  Ray realizes how right he is.   Stupid. What were you thinkng?  Ray looks at Dave a contemplative beat, then walks over to his truck. He leans in the passenger side and pulls out the engagement ring box. Dave walks over.   Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.   No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched.  Ray is excited by the plan and Dave's right there with him.   Man, I love AM radio. You got right-wing conspiracy, tips for pregnant womem, Single-A baseball games, and real country music... None of that new crap...  He adjusts the dial again, tuning in a country song, \"MAMAS, DON'T LET YOUR BABIES GROW UP TO BE COWBOYS,\" by Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson.  Dave starts singing along, extra LOUD and out of tune.    \"...Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys, don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks. Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such.\"  Ray looks at his goofy friend singing and starts to get a little happy himself...  Then, Ray sees something in the road ahead. He turns down the radio. They both stare --    I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --   The guy looks dead.  Ray has seen this before --",
        "Tyrell": "You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.   Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.  He's looking for a dark corner or a storeroom or something.   I'll talk real slow.  He's kissing her ear. She starts to giggle.  The bartender sets down drinks on Karla's tray.   You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.   That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?  Karla passes by --    Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.   Where I come from, you want to snatch the goodies, you got to at least talk to them first.  Tyrell and Karla go for it on the dance floor, leaving Will and Julie alone. They look at each other. They look at everyone dancing.   Hey, baby, we gonna get tropical or we gonna get tropical?  The passenger door opens and Will Benson steps hesitantly around the Jeep.   Is there a problem here?    Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.   Can't talk right now.   Are we there yet?   I feel like I'm still on that thing.  A dockhand, DERRICK, glides past him toward the ladies.    I can get used to this.  Derrick reaches for Julie's hand, clearly checking her out in the process.   Yes, ma'am.  Karla THWACKS him on the back of the head, but they're all having fun.  The path widens. The trees part. It's even nicer up close. They walk across a tiled plaza.  Behind them, THREE YOUNG GUYS carry their GIRLFRIENDS piggyback, racing each other toward the departure dock.  Our two arriving couples move on toward the entrace, passing a FENCED TENNIS COURT on the left. A GLASS-PANED ORCHID HOUSE straight ahead. And, on the right,  A LUSH POOL with a built-in JACUZZI in the shallow end. An outdoor THATCHED ROOF BAR stands nearby -- and just beyonk it, a small POOL   Not possible.   I'll scare somebody up.  He grabs the knob and pulls the door open to...  RROWWWR? A PIT BULL ON A CHAIN JUMPS UP INTO HIS FACE -- its toothy maw snapping shut about a half inch from his nose.   Whoa!  Julie and Karla laugh. Karla goes to hit the bell once more -- ONLY TO  Nice dog.   What's your problem, buddy?   Okay, we get it...It's old.   We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.   Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!  The mood is improving. A SQUEEKING NOISE interupts.  A BRASS LUGGAGE CART has appeared behind them. And ESTES, 60s, the weary Haitian porter, steps from behind it.   Guess the capital of Brazil --   Promised me what, baby?  I made all my promises to William.  Tyrell makes fake goo-goo eyes at Will. Estes looks away.   Sweetie, you brought your nightie, didn't you?    Tell me this ain't the bar scene.   Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?   The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.   What's the matter, boy trouble?   He leave you?   Pretty cool bar.   Go baby! Go!    Karla bounces playfully on their big bed as Tyrell crosses toward the windows.   Why?   Ah, baby, let's stay right here.  Karla pulls her suit out of a bag and models it seductively and flirtatiously for Tyrell.   I like the sound of this.    Hello?   Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.  She splashes him.   Too late for that. We're miles from anywhere, baby. No one's gonna hear you scream.  He goes in for a serious kiss. Things start to heat up --    I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.  Tyrell is done talking. He pulls her over to him and the moment becomes more passionate.  Karla opens her eyes in time to see --   What's the policy on burnin' herb?   There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.   Crowded.    Yeah. Find another Jacuzzi.  Karla shoots Tyrell a look.   Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.   The rest of us see bathrobes.    Fine. Show me the body.  Will wanders over to the closet and checks it out.   There's a storm coming?    We move into the hotel room and gradually reveal FOUR SETS OF FEET at the end of one bed. They are crammed into a king-size bed together.  Julie is awake. She gets out of bed and moves toward the window.  It's raining outside. The wind is blowing. The storm has arrived.  Karla pulls a sleeping hand off her chest. The hand belongs to Will. She pinches the hand. Will starts.  Tyrell kicks his feet around, trying to get some room.   This ain't the romantic weekend I had in mind.  Karla kisses Tyrell on the cheek.   Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.    See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?  Julie ignores him, staring out the window.   I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.   Where is everybody?   Shut up.  They walk down the steps to the lobby.   They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.   Hey -- shut up, okay?  Tyrell keeps walking. Will looks around at the wind-and-water-swept vista. Not much of a day for activities.    You coming?  Will trots after him, but he takes a glance back at the window...Estes is gone.    Hey, Bong Marley. Come here.  The door SLAMS shut behind him.  Tyrell looks back at the door. The latch seems to have stuck and it's no longer swinging.  Tyrell turns back toward the other door and sees  The PIT BULL  standing in the doorway. Tyrell stares at the dog. The dog GROWLS at Tyrell, low and menacing.   I'm gonna kill you, Bong Boy.  Simultaneously, Tyrell turns and the dog lunges forward.  Tyrell sprints to the door -- it's LOCKED by a length of metal slipped into the coupling.  He turns to see the dog bounding at him --  Tyrell leaps up the fence just as the pit bull lunges for him. The dog catches his pant leg. Tyrell kicks him away and frantically scrambles up.  The dog relentlessly barks and snaps as Tyrell climbs the fence.   Thanks.  I gotta find me a pool boy.   Take this.   Julienne of pool boy.  They move toward the nearby POOL HOUSE.   I'm gonna throw the door. Get ready.  Tyrell opens the door and charges in. Will's right behind him.   Hey, pool boy.  Tyrell closes the distance and kicks Titus in the back.  Titus falls over like a block of wood, rictus already setting in.  His hands are bound behind him. The cord is tied off to some pipes against the wall.   What the -- ?  Will splashes a puddle of rainwater on his face --   Cyanide? Like poison gas?  You mean, somebody really killed him...Omigod. Think...Think...  Suddenly, they both hear KARLA SCREAMING. They sprint for the main building.   Get back --   Give me your hand!  She reaches for him. He pulls her up and out through the window.   Hang on...   Yo, Brooks, listen up --  Whoa --  Tyrell, Will, and Karla look at the radio, which is smashed on the floor next to Brooks.  Julie stares in shock at the reverse wall, at   Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.   They were cut loose.   Who?   We're on an island, miles from anywhere. I don't give a crap about you're fisherman. There's dead bodies pilling up everywhere and there's one guy missing --  Will moves closer to Tyrell --   Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.  Tyrell turns and heads down the dock. Will goes with him. Karla takes a few hesitant steps after them, then turns back toward Julie, who hasn't moved.   Yo, Freak Boy --  The cluttered room is empty.   We're gonna find some weird crap in here.  In the corner there is a curtain used as a partition. Julie pulls the curtain back and discovers   I told you.  Julie looks closer. She sees her toothbrush, a hair tie, assorted other knickknacks belonging to her friends.    Missing a hair tie?  Karla looks in. Tyrell snatches the straw man up.   We found our guy.  THUNDER rumbles across the sky like the judgement of God.   We gotta find flashlights, torches, guns if they got 'em, anything that'll help.  Will and Tyrell eye the stairs leading down to the lobby.   Wait. Maybe he's down there collecting the body parts.  Will and Tyrell exchange a glance, an \"are you man enough?\" kind of glance.   Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.  Karla is terrified and waits by the stairs, but something catches Julie's eye. She walks across the lobby.   Let go. I got him. That's me. It's him. We got you...   Here's youre killer --    You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?    You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --  Estes steps forward --   Show us.  They begin moving for the door.   What is up with that weirdo?   I'll come with you.   I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.   What I need is a gun. Not a steak knife.  Karla grabs a paring knife --   You gonna clean vegetables? You gonna stir-fry? You need something that'll get his attention.  He picks up a huge butcher's knife and cuts the air with it. He then roughly empties other drawers looking for more weapons.  Karla looks to Julie, something on her mind. Julie catches the look.   Forget that. You didn't do nothing. This fisherman's a piece of scum.  I should've been listening to you... I'm sorry.  Julie smiles for a second.   Now, let's take a look at the pantry.   I don't know, but I'm starving.   Steel door...Food...Perfect.  He starts looking for something to eat --  CLANK. There's a soft CLATTERING from somewhere in the room. Everyone freezes, staring into the darkness.  Tyrell puts a finger to his lips, then creeps down an aisle, listening. There's nothing but SILENCE.  He moves toward the first aisle...He jumps out. The aisle is empty.   It's just a --    Don't kill me --   And so could you -- crazy fool.   Must have missed the sign.    Don't even get her started...It's a long, long story and you probably wouldn't believe a word of it.  Tyrell moves as he talks, fed up and exhasted. He crosses past the stove and under a huge hanging rack of pots and pans.   I mean, all I know for sure is this is the worst vacation of my life... I'm tired, and I'm hungry, and I personally haven't seen one damn psycho killer...      Karla and Ben hit the bed in a rain of glass.  Karla bounces to her feet and dives out of the way as Ben swings his hook.",
        "Nancy": "You guys lost?   Wanna drink?   How about some ID?  They freeze.   Kidding.  They nod.   Didn't anyone tell you this is --   That's none of your business.  Tyrell sizes her up quickly.   Not anymore.   No. I shot him.  Will and Tyrell exchange a danger-Will-Robinson glance.   What you want is a Dark and Stormy: Vernon's rum, ginger beer, and a touch of Tabasco. Sailors drink it for luck in the hurricane season, trust me.   Nancy.  Welcome to Tower Bay's most happenin' hotspot.  Nancy continues making their cocktails.   Four Dark and Stormies...  They all pick up their drinks.   Make fun of tourists mainly.  Or let them make fun of themselves...  She flips a switch that lights the Karaoke stage.    Everyone thinks their a singer.   What's going on?   Cool.   Don't look at me --   I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --   You stumbled into my hiding place.   Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.   Who's doing this?   I know where we can hide.   Give me a boost up --  Julie helps Nancy reach a pull cord in the ceiling.   There's no way to grip this thing.  Suddenly the STEEL TIP of the HOOK pokes through the crack...It wriggles around...Turning...And begins to pull the hatch down.  They try to hold it...But it's no use. They let go and jump away.  The attic is lit by a cathedral window. It's crosshatched with wooden beams and pink insulation.   Watch your step...  THUNK! Karla's foot goes through a gap between two beams.   Stay on the beams!  Karla and Julie follow her precarious progress.  Ben climbs off the ladder to a beam. He watches them leap from beam to beam. His hook glints in the light.  Julie, Karla, and Nancy move toward the cathedral window. They turn. They are cut off. They spread out against the wall looking for an opening to get back to the hatch.  Ben feints toward Nancy then swipes at Julie --  He misses. She leaps away. She looks down. Instead of insulation, she sees a   It's gotta be one of these.  Nancy tries the first of many keys. Something catches Julie's eye. She moves in for a closer look. Her eyes go wide --    It's jammed!  The key is stuck.   It's over there.  They struggle together to open the heavy door.   There's a light somewhere.   This place has emergency power. Just ease you way down the stairs and I'll find the light.    I saw one in the lobby.  Karla starts, then hesitates. Will moans, looks at her.   I'll come with you.   Look up there. I'll look over here.  Karla looks behind the desk. Nancy is searching the shelves.   Help me.  Karla rushes to Nancy. She tugs on her arm, trying to pull her free.  The fisherman strides toward them. He raises his hook. He swings at Karla's head."
