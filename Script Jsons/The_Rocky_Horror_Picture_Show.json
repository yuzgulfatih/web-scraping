        "Ralph": "Well Brad, I guess we made it huh!   Tell you the truth Brad, she was the only reason I came in the first place. Science was never one of my favourite subjects but I sure with Dr Scott could have made it today.   Hey fella.  It looks like it could be your turn next.",

        "A": "Adapted from \"The Rocky Horror Show\" a musical     with Book, Music &amp; Lyrics by Richard O'Brien     Soft Drum-Roll.    Fanfare.     On the sides of the image are stationary sprocket holes of celluloid. SCIENCE FICTION DOUBLE FEATURE * Musical Introduction. Film head runs down numbers:  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, START. Very scratched.  During the SONG we see snatches of the films mentioned in SONG.  They look old and scratched and they are INTERCUT with flashes of white screen, burnt celluloid, etc.                          Well Brad, I guess we made it huh!   Well I don't think there was any doubt about that - You and Betty have been almost inseparable ever since you sat in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures.   Tell you the truth Brad, she was the only reason I came in the first place. Science was never one of my favourite subjects but I sure with Dr Scott could have made it today.   Yes, Janet and I are both fond of him. We drove over to see him last vacation. It's a shame his new job took him away from Denton.  BETTY, the bride, throws the bouquet.  JANET catches it.  She squeals with delight.  The GUESTS cheer.   Hey fella.  It looks like it could be your turn next.   Who knows...ha ha.  RALPH &amp; BETTY drive off.  GUESTS wave and shout, BRAD &amp; JANET with great enthusiasm.  GUESTS begin to disperse.  JANET &amp; BRAD linger outside the church.  So do a strange FAMILY :  An old man with a pitchfork and his wife and daughter.  They resemble the Quaker family in \"American Gothic\", a painting.  The MOTHER  and FATHER (RIFF RAFF) stand outside the church doors.  Their DAUGHTER  goes inside.  The FAMILY, and the MINISTER , and the GUESTS all resemble characters we shall meet later at the Frank N. Furter place.   Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful. Didn't Betty look radiantly beautiful. Just an hour ago she was plain old Betty Monroe.  Now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapschatt.   Er...yes, Janet.......Ralph's a lucky guy.   Yes.   Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.   Yes.   And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.   Yes.     Hey Janet.   Yes Brad.   I've got something to say.   Uh huh.   I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.   Oh Brad.     The river was deep but I swam it.   Janet.   The future is ours so let's plan it.   Janet.   So please don't tell me to can it.   Janet.   I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.  The road was long but I ran it.    Janet.   There's a fire in my heart And you fan it.   Janet.   If there's one fool for you Then I am it.   Janet.   I've one thing to say and that's, Dammit, Janet.  He chalks a heart and arrow on the church door, which Riff Raff proceeds to wipe off.   I love you.  JANET runs to him, he kneels and produces a ring.   Here's a ring to prove that I'm not joker.  CHURCH BELLS Peal out.  RIFF &amp; MAGENTA open doors and solemnly enter the church, door closes behind them.   There's three ways that love can grow. That's good bad or mediocre.  JANET grabs the ring as BRAD rises.  She throws down the bouquet and would fall into BRAD's arms but he goes to the door to chalk on it again.   Oh - J - A - N - E - T I love you so.  JANET, transfixed, bursts into the church.    \"WEDDING SONG\"  Pt. 2  JANET bursts into the church, hypnotised by the ring.  BRAD follows her.   Oh!......It's nicer than Betty Munroe had   Oh Brad.   Now we're engaged and I'm so glad.  MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA Oh Brad.   That you met Mom And you know Dad.   Oh Brad.   I've one thing to say And that's, Brad I'm mad, For you too.  BRAD &amp; JANET start to walk d.s., arm in arm.  the strange FAMILY march slowly across them l/r., in front.   Oh, Brad.   Oh Dammit.   I'm mad.....   Oh Janet   For you.   I love you too-oo-oo.  BRAD takes JANET's hands, turning to her.  We are aware of THE FAMILY bringing in coffin in b.g. through vestry door.  BRAD &amp; JANET There's one thing left to do-ah-ooh     And that's go see the man Who began it   Janet.   When we met in his science exam It -  THE FAMILY move into position behind BRAD &amp; JANET   Janet.   Made me give you the eye And then panic,   Janet  FAMILY lower coffin onto floor.   I've got one thing to say, and that's Dammit, Janet.  I love you.  JANET runs to BRAD and he hugs her.   Dammit, Janet.  JANET circles BRAD twice, admiring her ring on the way.   Oh Brad, I'm mad.   Dammit, Janet.  BRAD &amp; JANET kneel together with each following word until they are kneeling on the floor   I love you.  BRAD &amp; JANET kiss.  The cross above spits optically.    Mahogany bookcases, a large desk with a prominent globe of the world.  A well-padded armchair has its back to the camera.  It swings around revealing the NARRATOR.  He is in his smoking jacket.  He speaks directly to us.   I would like if I may to take you on a strange journey.  He crosses to the bookshelf.  He selects a dossier.  We see the title: \"The Denton Affair\".  He returns to his desk and places it on a bookstand.  He puts on his reading glasses.   It seemed a fairly ordinary night when Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss  left Denton that late November evening to visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and now friend of both of them.  It's true there were dark storm clouds, heavy, black and pendulous, toward which they were driving.  It's true also that the spare tyre they were carrying was badly in need of some air.  But they being normal kids and on a night out, well they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening.  On a night out.  He closes the book marking the place.  Thunder is heard distantly on the sound track.   It was a night out they were going to remember for a very long time.  Lighting cracks on the sound track.   Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.   Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.  JANET takes another stick of gum.  Offers BRAD some.  He declines.  The car slows to a halt.   What's the matter Brad, darling?  Headlights on sign reading: \"DEAD END\".   I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.   Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?   Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.    Car reverses.  BRAD puts his foot on the accelerator.  The wheel skids and explodes.     What was that bang?   We must have a blow-out.   Oh...  Pause    A bolt of lighting strikes a tree.     You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.   But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.   Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.  He unbuckles his seatbelt.   I'm coming with you.   There's no point both of us getting wet.   I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.  BRAD laughs.  A thunderclap.  MUSIC commences and she alights from the car and follows him, newspaper over her head.      The rain pours off the newspaper down JANET's face.  She walks along, catching up with BRAD.  She sing plaintively.   In the velvet darkness Of the blackest night Burning bright.  We see the two of them - BRAD striding ahead, JANET nearly catching up with him.  Behind them on the side of the road, sparse trees and rock formations.   There's a guiding star No matter what or who you are.  They have passed a row of trees.  A rock formation in the shape of a castle is silhouetted against the sky.  It has a flag flying from the turret.  Lightning strikes.  A glow of light appears in a window.  It illuminates a path to the castle.  BRAD and JANET turn.  The castle is in the distance between the two of them.  BRAD &amp; JANET There's a light  The castle looms in the distance.   Over at the Frankenstein place.  BRAD stares hard.   There's a light.  The castle looms closer.   Burning in the fireplace.    There's a light, a light In the darkness of everybody's life  Taking JANET by the hand, BRAD moves off the roadway towards the house.   I can see the flag fly I can see the rain Just the same There has got to be Something better here For you and me.  Lighting strikes.  JANET jumps towards BRAD.  BRAD &amp; JANET There's a light.  The castle seems to move forward.   Burning in the fireplace.   There's a light.    A motorcycle convoy roars by revealing a hidden road to the castle.   A light In the darkness of everybody's life.  The convoy drives up and disappears into a secret entrance in the rock.    We see a cell-like window near a massive lighted window.  A tortured face appears squinting into the darkness.   The darkness must go Down the river of nights dreaming Flow morphia slow Let the sun and light come streaming Into my life.    RIFF RAFF moves to the lighted window where his hunchbacked shape becomes a giant shadow.   Into my life.    BRAD and JANET start moving down the driveway.  BRAD &amp; JANET There's a light.    Shadow turns in the window.   Over at the Frankenstein place.    BRAD and JANET approach the gateway to the castle.  BRAD &amp; JANET There's a light.    The shadow slowly covers the whole window.   Burning in the fireplace.     There's a light, a light.  BRAD and JANET are at the gate.  There is a rusted sign.  BRAD &amp; JANET In the darkness of everybody's life.  A bolt of lighting illuminates the sign which reads:  FRANK N. FURTER -  And so it seemed that fortune had smiled on Brad and Janet and that they had found the assistance that their plight required - or had they?  Thunderclap.    BRAD rings the doorbell.  It makes a strange sound.   Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.   Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.  The door opens.  Throbbing music is heard in the background as if there is a party going on in the distance.  The figure we have seen at the window emerges.  He is a hunch-backed servant, RIFF RAFF.   Hello.   Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?   You're wet.   Yes, the rain has been very heavy.   Yes.   Yes.    A bolt of lighting illuminates a row of vehicles parked by the castle.    BRAD sees them and reacts with surprise.  RIFF RAFF realises BRAD has seen them.   I think you had better both come inside.   You're too kind.  They enter apprehensively.    RIFF RAFF leads them down a stairway and beckons them to follow.  The MUSIC has become louder.    Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?    Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.    They arrive at a hallway at the bottom of the stairs.  Another servant, MAGENTA, who bears a striking physical resemblance to RIFF RAFF is vacuuming the stairs.   This way.  JANET steps over the vacuum lead.   Are you - giving a party?   No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.   Oh, lucky him.   He's lucky.  BRAD and JANET look at MAGENTA, surprised by her voice.   You're lucky, I'm lucky, we're all lucky.    BRAD and JANET are rather unnerved by this outburst from the domestic. They look back to RIFF RAFF.  He is now standing by a set of mirrors reflecting to infinity.   It's astounding Time is fleeting Madness takes its toll But listen closely Not for very much longer I've got to keep control.  MAGENTA gives RIFF RAFF a strange signal.  RIFF RAFF starts to dance in an extraordinary fashion.   I remember doing the Time Warp.  BRAD and JANET are amazed.   Drinking those moments when The blackness would hit me.  MAGENTA half closes her eyes in pleasure.  JANET clings to BRAD.   And the void would be calling.  RIFF RAFF opens a set of double doors marked BALLROOM.    BRAD and JANET find themselves on a balcony of a huge black and silver ballroom.  At the furthest end is a throne-like chair and, surrounding it, a theatre proscenium.  In the body of the room are GUESTS.  They are the people BRAD and JANET passed on the road.  They are the Transylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this special occasion from all over the earth.  It is the Annual Transylvanian Convention - announced by an official banner suspended over the Ballroom.  They are all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear.  They are a distorted version of the GUESTS from the Denton wedding.  A party spirit prevails, they throw their arms out in a plea to RIFF RAFF on the balcony.   It's just a jump to the left.    The GUESTS leap to the left in one giant step.   With your hands on your hips.    ALL GUESTS have hands on hips.    They collide with MAGENTA who has blocked off the corridor with her vacuum.  She sings with menace, waving the cleaner hose dangerously.   It's so dreamy Oh, fantasy free me So you can't see me No not at all.  BRAD and JANET look at each other in alarm.  In another dimension. (she forces them back towards balcony With voyeuristic intention.  BRAD blushes.  Well secluded I see all With a bit of a mind flip You're into the time slip Nothing will ever seem the same.  They are back at the balcony.  You're spaced out on sensation.  They are at the edge of the balcony.  Like you're under sedation.  They force BRAD and JANET into the Ballroom proper.  The GUESTS turn on them.     Well I was walking down the street Just having a think When a snake of a guy Gave me an evil wink. Well it shook me up It took me by surprise He had a pick-up truck And the devil's eyes He stared at me And I felt a change Time meant nothing Never would again.     It's just a jump to the left.  He jumps to the left.     With your hands on your hips.      But it's the pelvic thrust.  LOW TRAVELLING SHOT between their legs.  That really drives you insane. Let's do the Time Warp again.  Everyone reverses direction.  Let's do the Time Warp again.  All the GUESTS fall to the floor like flies exhausted.     Oh....Say something.   Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?  No one laughs.  GUESTS turn nasty.    BRAD and JANET retreat to the hall.  Behind them a lift slowly descends bearing a figure in a black cloak and a diamante stiletto heel - beating time to a rhythm the band has started playing.   Brad, please lets get out of here.   For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.   But it seems so unhealthy here.   It's just a..a party Janet.   Well I want to leave.   We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.   Then ask the butler - or someone.   Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.   This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.   They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.   Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.   I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.  GUESTS rise, staring mesmerised at the lift.  JANET sees the shoe, looks up at the face of its owner.  JANET faints.  --------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------    The figure turns and throws open lift cage door.  As camera zooms in to the death mask above them the film changes from black and white to colour.  However the only colour in evidence is the red lipstick on the mouth of their host.     How do you do.  I see you've met my faithful handyman. He's a little brought down - Because when you knocked He thought you were the candyman.  RIFF RAFF scowls.     Don't get strung out by the way that I look.  FRANK strides across the Ballroom to the throne.   Don't judge a book by its cover I'm not much of a man By the light of day But by night I'm one hell of a lover.  JANET gives a silent scream.  FRANK lets the cloak fall onto the throne, which reveals his transvestite attire.  The GUESTS scream with delight.   I'm just a sweet Transvestite From Transexual Transylvania.  He slowly moves back to BRAD and JANET, doing leg kicks.  Let me show you around, maybe play you a sound You look like you're both pretty groovie.  He circles them and forces them into the Ballroom.  Or if you want something visual not too abysmal We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie.  BRAD clumsily attempts to circle around FRANK.  FRANK meanwhile ignores him and greets his other guests.   I'm glad we caught you at home Ah - could we use your phone We're both in a bit of a hurry.  JANET joins BRAD.   Right!   We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.  FRANK turns on them.   You got caught with a flat Well how about that Well babies don't you panic By the light of the night It'll seem alright I'll get you a satanic mechanic.  FRANK turns his back on BRAD and JANET and splitting the ranks of his GUESTS, departs for the other end of the Ballroom.  Streamers fall.   I'm just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania.  From the throne he gestures towards BRAD and JANET rather slowly over the next verse.   Why dont'cha stay for the night  RIFF &amp; MAGENTA \"night\" Or maybe a bite  RIFF &amp; MAGENTA \"bite\" I could show you my favourite obsession I've been making a man With blonde hair and a tan And he's good for relieving my tension.  We view from OVERHEAD as the GUESTS surround him adoringly.   I'm just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania.  FRANK storms down the Ballroom to the lift.  I'm just a sweet transvestite.   From Transexual Transylvania.     So come up to the Lab.       And see what's on the slab.       I see you shiver with anticipation       But maybe the rain       Is really to blame       So I'll remove the cause But not the symptom      On the last chord the lift has disappeared.  The GUESTS applaud ecstatically.  RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA close in on BRAD and JANET.  They remove BRAD and JANET's wet clothes.  COLUMBIA moves down from the bandstand and crosses to BRAD and JANET. She witnesses the undressing.   Slowly, slowly.  It's too nice a job to rush.  The GUESTS moan softly as each piece of clothing is removed.  BRAD and JANET stand shivering in their underwear.  There is complete silence.  The GUESTS and SERVANTS are motionless.  BRAD and JANET are the total object of their attention.     Oh Brad.    It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.  He turns to COLUMBIA who has been staring at his underpants.   Ah, hi.  My name is Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  You are ...   You are very lucky to be invited up to Frank's laboratory.  Some people would give their right arm for the privilege.  RIFF RAFF has opened the cage doors to the lift.  The GUESTS rush for positions.   People like you maybe   I've seen it.  COLUMBIA escorts them to the lift.  RIFF RAFF throws two GUESTS to the floor to make room for them. He slams the cage door.  The two discarded GUESTS cry and claw at the cage door as the lift moves off under RIFF RAFF's control.  BRAD and JANET are squashed, arms by their side.  They stare straight ahead.    It he - Frank - is he your husband?  General amusement.   The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.   Oh.  The lift grinds to a halt.  They have arrived at the laboratory.    The laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating theatre and a Greek gymnasium.  It is pink-tiled throughout, facing the lift entrance is a circular area containing a TANK on pedestals which though screened at this stage will be revealed to contain the body of ROCKY submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side contains a raised dias area for the GUESTS, and facing one end of the tank, the operational controls, monitor and a giant refrigerator.  A chandelier hangs above the tank.  On the podium in front of Frank's chambers there is a stand microphone. Near the podium are some weights.  Behind the tank is a vaulting horse. These are wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents.  The GUESTS are waiting as the lift arrives.  FRANK, now in surgeon's outfit stands in the middle of the room.  RIFF RAFF gets out of the lift first, with a glass of champagne which he hands to FRANK.   Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff Raff.  As he speaks her name each one steps forward out of the lift.  They cross to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.   I will entertain...ah...  BRAD &amp; JANET step out of the lift.   I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.   Weiss.   Weiss.   Encante....How nice. And what charming underclothes you both have. (He takes two dust coats from Riff Raff and hands them to Brad). But here, put these on.  They'll make you feel less vulnerable.  MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA cross to the podium.   It's not often we receive visitors here. Let alone offer them hospitality.   Hospitality!  All we wanted to do was use your telephone.  A reasonable request which you have chosen to ignore.   Don't be ungrateful Brad.   Ungrateful!  The room falls silent.  All eyes are on FRANK, waiting for his reaction. A smile breaks on his face.   How forceful you are Brad.  Such a perfect specimen of manhood.  So dominant.  MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA laugh.  You must be awfully proud of him Janet.   Well, yes I am.  THE GUESTS oh and ah appreciatively, BRAD laughs, a little embarassed.   Do you have any tattoos Brad.   Certainly not!   Oh well.  How about you.  RIFF RAFF has approached behind FRANK, looming over his shoulder.   Everything is in readiness, Master. We merely await your word.  FRANK drinks his champagne then hands RIFF RAFF the empty glass.  RIFF RAFF goes to the control panel and FRANK to the podium   Tonight...One, one, one.  Can you hear me at the back? Tonight, my unconventional conventionists.  MAGENTA, COLUMBIA and GUESTS laugh politely.   Tonight you are to witness a breakthrough in biochemical research.  There is a gasp from COLUMBIA, MAGENTA and GUESTS.   And paradise is to be mine.  GUESTS and everybody applaud.  JANET claps too, but BRAD indicates that she shouldn't.   It was strange the way it happened. One of those quirks of fate really. One of those moments when you seem irredeemably lost:  you panic; you're trapped; your back's against the wall. There's no way out, and then suddenly, you get a break.  (He cracks the bones in his hand)  All the pieces seem to fit into place.  What a sucker you'r been. What a fool.  The answer was there all the time.  It took a small accident to make it happen.  An accident!  MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA step forward one each side of him.  MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA An accident.   That's how I discovered the secret. That elusive ingredient, that spark that is the breath of life.  GUESTS applaud.   You see, Brad and Janet, you are fortunate. For tonight is the night that my beautiful creature is destined to be born.  Everybody applauds.  FRANK then pulls the cover from the tank.  RIFF RAFF is at the control panel.    The tank is revealed.  There is something inside it is immersed in clear fluid.  The GUESTS are astonished.   Throw open the switches on the sonic oscillator.  RIFF RAFF flicks the switch to activate the oscilloscopes in the panel.   And step up the reactor power input three more points.  RIFF RAFF presses a button three times then begins to unwind a wheel.  FRANK watches excitedly from behind the tank as the chandelier is lowered.  It spurts different coloured liquids into the tank.  The liquids bubble and change colour.  The thing inside begins to look like a human form.   Brad...   It's alright Janet.  The liquids drain away.  The form begins to move.  FRANK climbs the ladder at one end of the tank, RIFF RAFF the other.  ROCKY HORROR sits up, raises his arms, finally stands upright with both arms outstretched.  RIFF RAFF removes the bandage from ROCKY's head.  ROCKY looks at RIFF RAFF then at FRANK.  With a gasp he leaps for the chandelier above.  At the same time RIFF RAFF is down the ladder making for the handle.  He winds up the chandelier and ROCKY.      ROCKY HORROR with only his head unbandaged, is hanging on to the chandelier which RIFF RAFF is winding upwards.   Rocky needed peace of mind. He didn't know He was doing just fine.  He was the product Of another time. And as for feeling down - Well that's not a crime.    FRANK and RIFF RAFF are recovering from their fall.  ROCKY makes a circuit of the GUESTS.    FRANK picks himself up.  ROCKY is sitting at the top of the ladder above him, with his perfect limbs near Frank's face.   Well.  That's no way to behave on your first day out.  ROCKY looks hurt.  But as you're such an exceptional beauty I'm prepared to forgive.  FRANK crosses behind ROCKY to stand next to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.  I just love success.   He is a credit to your genius, Master.   Yes.   A triumph of your vill.   Yes.   He's o.k.   O.K?  (Moving out behind tank towards Janet and Brad)  I think we can do a little better than that.  You.    What do you think?   Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.   I didn't make him for you  JANET nods hastily.  FRANK moves towards microphone.  He carries the Charles Atlas seal of approval....And he didn't even take the lessons.      As FRANK starts to sing, MAGENTA &amp; RIFF RAFF collect one of ROCKY's presents, the vaulting horse, and place it in front of the podium. COLUMBIA leads ROCKY down from the ladder.   A weakling weighing Ninety eight pounds Will get sand in his face When kicked to the ground. And soon in the gym With a determined chin The sweat from his pores As he works for his ca-ha-hause  MAGENTA &amp; RIFF RAFF now bring the weights.   Will make him glisten - thank you - And gleam. And with massage And just a little bit of Ste-he-he-he-hem... He'll be pink. And quite clean.   He'll be a strong man - Oh honey -  GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA &amp; FRANK. But the wrong man.   He'll eat nutritious high protein And swallow raw eggs. Try to build up his shoulders, His chest, arms and legs.  Such an effort - If he only knew of my plan. In just seven days,  GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA &amp; FRANK I can make you a ma-aa-a-a-an  ROCKY throws down the weights and begins press ups.   He'll do press-ups and chin-ups, Do the snatch, clean and jerk.  FRANK crosses to JANET &amp; BRAD  He thinks dynamic tension Must be hard work. Such strenuous living I just don't understand.  FRANK moves back to ROCKY who is still pressing up.  When, in just seven days - Oh baby...  I can make you A ma-a-a-a-an....    The large refrigeration unit door slowly opens, falling like a drawbridge.  Inside is a wall of ice and many CocaCola bottles. Through these bursts an icy EDDIE riding a Harley Davidson motor bike, ex World War II, holding a Gibson guitar.  Several guests are crushed to death.   Eddie!   Who's Eddie?   The delivery boy.   His delivery wasn't good enough though.  ROCKY looks terrified.  JANET has fainted yet again.  EDDIE comes to life.     Hot patootie Bless my soul I really love that rock and roll   EDDIE  leaps onto the motorbike in a legs apart guitar strumming pose.  FRANK is getting furious.  ROCKY is perplexed.

Hot patootie Bless my soul. I really love that rock and roll.  4 bars instrumental  FRANK steals towards the fridge where he collects an ice pick, innocently.

Hot patootieHOT PATOOTIE Bless my soul.I LOVE-A-LOVE-A-LOVE-A I really love that rock and roll.   On the last chorus FRANK rushes to EDDIE with the ice pick, in a demented fury.  THE GUESTS are unbelieving.  COLUMBIA covers her face with her hands.  EDDIE is dead.  FRANK walks away from his body unconcerned.  JANET screams and screams.      MAGENTA is very bored and picking up ice cubes and placing them in the ice bucket.   One from the vaults.  RIFF RAFF drags EDDIE's dismembered body back into the fridge.  And so perish all those who reject my love!  ROCKY cowers in terror.  Oh no, my little Adonis - You're much too beautiful to be destroyed. He had a certain naive charm - but no muscle.  ROCKY flexes.  FRANK is thrilled.     But a deltoid And a bicep, A hot groin And a tricep Makes me - ooh - Shake. Makes me want To take Charles Atlas By the ha-and.  In just seven days - Oh baby -  GUESTS, RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA &amp; FRANK I can make you a Ma-ha-ha-ha-haan.  I don't want no dissension Just dynamic tension.  In just seven days I can make you A ma-ha-ha-ha-haan.  In just seven days I can make you A ma-ha-ha-ha-haaan.    RIFF RAFF presses a button and a wall opens revealing a bridal suite done out in black silk.  The GUESTS shout their approval.  The end of the SONG turns into Mendelssohn's wedding march and FRANK leads ROCKY to his bridal chamber.  The GUESTS throw confetti.  BRAD and JANET look at each other in amazement.   There are some people who say that life is an illusion, and that reality is simply a figment of our imaginations!  If this is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe. However, the sudden departure of their host and his creation (into the seclusion of his sombre bridal suite) had left them feeling both apprehensive and uneasy. A feeling which grew as the other guests 'departed' and 'they' were shown to their separate rooms.    JANET looks lost.  She sits on the end of the bed.    BRAD looks lost.  He examines the TV monitor.    RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA by the monitor.  They switch from channel to channel.  We see BRAD looking at the TV monitor.  And JANET sitting on the end of the bed.  JANET lies back on the bed and switches off her bedside lamp.  RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA smile at each other.    Only a soft glow of moonlight from a barred window.  ON the netting round her bed.  There is a knock at the door.  JANET sits p.   Who is it?  Who's there?  BRAD's voice from behind the door.   It's only me, Janet.  She relaxes.   Oh, Brad, come in, darling.  A silhouette enters and crosses to the bed.  It moves onto the bed behind the net curtain.   Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...   It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.   Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.   No, don't do that.   Oh don't be so shy.  She switches on the light to reveal FRANK.    I'm afraid so, Janet.  But isn't it nice?  JANET beats his chest with her clenched fists.   You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?   Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?   You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never   I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.  He re-commences making love to her.   Oh - Oh - no - stop - I mean help. I - Brad - Oh.  Brad.  FRANK places a finger on her lips.   Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?   Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.   Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.  He switches off the light.    RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA stare intently at the screen.  They smile at each other.    Silhouette of FRANK and JANET making love.   Promise you won't tell Brad.   Cross my heart and hope to die.  JANET squeals with excitement.    We see ROCKY chained to the bed sleeping.  In the background RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA in laboratory.  ROCKY stirs and makes a sound.  RIFF RAFF walks across to the door and stares at the sleeping body.  His eyes are full of hate.  He looks at MAGENTA.  She nods to him.  He releases the chains.  ROCKY stirs.  RIFF RAFF picks up a candelabra from the bedside table and taunts ROCKY.  ROCKY jumps out of the bed, terrified.  RIFF RAFF pushes the candelabra in his face.  ROCKY crashes through the laboratory and escapes.  RIFF RAFF turns to MAGENTA who is now standing in the doorway.  RIFF RAFF puts down the candelabra and they exchange a strange sign.    A knock at the door.  BRAD opens it cautiously.  A shadowy figure moves across the room to the bed.    Oh Brad, it's no good here.  It will destroy us.  BRAD takes her hand.   Don't worry Janet, we'll be away from here in the morning.  Hmmmm, you smell so good.  He gently lays her down on the bed and attempts to caress her.   Oh Brad.  Oh no.  Not till after the wedding, Darling.  BRAD sits up.   Alright, Janet.  I understand.  The shadow rolls over.   Maybe we could try it this way.    Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.   I hope so my darling.  BRAD reaches out to the light.  No, don't put on the l...  BRAD switches on the bedside lamp an realises he is making love to FRANK wearing a JANET wig.   You!   I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?  BRAD grabs FRANK around the throat.   Why you - what have you done with Janet?   Nothing.  Why do you think I should?  BRAD lets him go and turns away humiliated.   You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.   I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.   Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.   Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?   Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.   Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.   Oh Brad, you have wasted so much time already.  Janet needn't know, I won't tell her.   You promise you won't tell?   On my mother's grave.  Suddenly the shadows are illuminated by the monitor as an image of RIFF RAFF appears on the screen above the bed.   Master, Rocky has broken his chains and vanished.  The new playmate is loose and in the castle ground.  Magenta has just released the dogs.    FRANK is getting carried away.   I'm coming.    A shot of pack of huge alsations careereing around the castle grounds. They are chasing a bewildered Rocky.    JANET is lying on the bed posed in the style of a \"True Romance\" comic heroine.   What's happening here?  Where's Brad? Where's anybody?    BRAD is posed in the style of a \"True Romance\" comic hero.  He is nervous and smoking.  Behind him FRANK is asleep on the bed.   Once in a while she don't want to call you Speaking on the telephone Once in your life she won't want to know you You look around The one you've found She is gone.    JANET is sitting on the end of the bed.   I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.     And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.    JANET is at the door.   I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.     So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.   I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?     And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.     If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.   \"If\" and \"Only\", two small words.  Words which kept repeating themselves again and again in Janet's thoughts.  But it was too late to go back now.  It was as if she were riding a giant tidal wave.  It would be folly to fight against it.  Her only chance would be to ride it out - adapt - and perhaps also to survive.    JANET is pacing around the tank which is covered by a cloth.  She becomes aware of the sound of someone crying inside.  She pulls the cloth back to reveal ROCKY lying in the tank - exhausted and bleeding.  ROCKY HORROR looks miserable.   Yes.  There you see it's instinctive. This room is your womb.  You returned here for one thing - security.  JANET crosses to the TV monitor.   Oh Brad!  What have they done with him?     Ahhh!  ROCKY smiles helplessly.  JANET moves away from the monitor and back to ROCKY.   Oh Brad.  How could you?  Oh, but you're hurt.  Did they do this to you?  ROCKY nods.   Here, lie down.  I'll dress your wounds.  ROCKY smiles at JANET.  A new expression crosses her face.    \"Emotion\".  Mental agitation - an excited state of.  It is also an irrational and powerful master and from what Janet had witnessed on the monitor, there seemed to be little doubt that she was indeed its slave.    COLUMBIA and MAGENTA are watching the monitor.  COLUMBIA &amp; MAGENTA Tell us about it, Janet.  They giggle.      ROCKY is lying on the operating table.  JANET is dabbing his wounds.   I was feeling done in Couldn't win I'd only ever kissed before    COLUMBIA and MAGENTA.    You mean she only ever kissed?    JANET rips off a piece of her petticoat for a bandage.   I thought there's no use getting Into heavy petting.  She rips off another piece of her petticoat.  It only leads to trouble And seat wetting.  JANET rips another piece off her fast vanishing petticoat.  During the next verse she bandages ROCKY.   Now all I want to know Is how to go I've tasted blood And I want more I'll put up no resistance I want to stay the distance I've got an itch to scratch And I need assistance.  JANET grabs ROCKY's hands and places them on her.   Touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me. I wanna be dirty. Thrill me, chill me, fulfil me. Creature of the night.  Then if anything grows While you pose, I'll oil you up And rub you down   Down, down down.   And that's just one small fraction Of the main attraction You need a friendly hand. Oh, and I need action.  Touch-a touch-a touch-a, touch me. I wanna be dirty. Thrill me, chil me, fulfil me. Creature of the night.    COLUMBIA &amp; MAGENTA are watching the TV relay of ROCKY &amp; JANET. They are amused by JANET'S inexperience, parodying her as they sing.   Touch-a touch-a touch-a, touch me.   I wanna be dirty.    Thrill me, chill me, fulfil me.   Creature of the night.     Oh, touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me. I wanna be dirty. Thrill me chill me, fulfil me - oh - Creature of the night.  Creature of the ni-i-ight.  We see JANET's p.o.v. of all the characters singing the last line:     Creature of the night.     Creature of the night.     Creature of the night.     Creature of the night.     Creature of the night.     Creature of the night.  Oh.    COLUMBIA &amp; MAGENTA's reactions.    JANET &amp; ROCKY in each other's arms hear another scream in the distance.    FRANK is chasing RIFF RAFF with a whip.  BRAD is following.  RIFF RAFF rushes into the lift and presses the button desperately but FRANK follows him and so does BRAD.  We see the lift descending.    RIFF RAFF slides across the laboratory floor escaping FRANK's whip.   Aaaargh!  Mercy.   How did it happen?  I understood you were to be watching.  RIFF RAFF gets to his feet keeping a careful eye on the whip hand.   I was only away for a minute Master.   Well, see if you can find him on the monitor.     Master, we have a visitor.     Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.   You know this earth - this person.   I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.   I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.   I told you, my car broke down.    FRANK looks BRAD hard in the eye.   I was telling the truth.   I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.   He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.   And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?   He might be.  I don't know.   Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.     Well, let's ask him.  FRANK throws a switch marked \"TRIPLE CONTACT ELECTRO MAGNET\".    We see DR SCOTT's wheelchair screaming through corridors, rooms and doors and ends up clamped to the electro magnet in the laboratory.    BRAD is amazed.   Dr. Scott!  DR EVERETT SCOTT is even more amazed.   Don't play games, Dr Scott.  You know very well what Brad Majors's doing here. It was part of your plan was it not that he, and his female, should check the layout for you.  Well, unfortunately for you all there's to be a change of plans.  I'm sure you're adaptable, Dr Scott.  I know Brad is.  BRAD looks embarrassed and humiliated.   Eddie?  I've seen him.  He's...  FRANK cuts in quickly.   Eddie?  What do you know of Eddie, Dr Scott?   Dr Scott.  A stifled gasp is heard from JANET behind the curtain.  FRANK is surprised.  FRANK crosses the screen and pulls back the curtain to reveal JANET and ROCKY.   Dr Scott!   Janet!   Rocky!  ROCKY reviles FRANK with a look.  He puts his arm around JANET.  FRANK is appalled.   Listen!  I made you, and I can break you just as easily.  ROCKY is terrified.  He takes his arm away from JANET.   That's better.  A GONG is heard.  MAGENTA comes through the broken tiles.   Master, dinner is prepared.  FRANK &amp; RIFF RAFF exchange a look.   Excellent.  Doctor Scott you can sample the speciality of the house - roast loin of pork.  He gives JANET, who is virtually naked, a seering look.   Under the circumstances, formal dress is to be optional.  FRANK leads the way to the lift.   Food has always played a vital role in life's rituals.  The breaking of bread - the last meal of the condemned man - and now this meal.  However informal it might appear you can be sure there was to be very little 'bonhomie'.   A toast to absent friends.   Absent friends.  FRANK now proceeds to carve the meat.  Everyone is quiet and only the buzzing of the electric carver is heard.  RIFF RAFF &amp; MAGENTA distribute the slices, then return to their places.   Eddie!   It's a rather tender subject.... Another slice anyone.  Everybody looks at their food carefully.  COLUMBIA rises.   Excuse me.  She rushes from from the room with a ghastly cry.   Go on, Dr. Scott - or should I say doctor von Scott.   What exactly are you implying?  FRANK threatens him with the knife.   But Doctor Scott...  DR. SCOTT silences BRAD with a gesture.   But he never caused her Nothing but shame.   When Eddie said He didn't like his teddy You knew he was a no good kid.  But when he threatened your life With a switch blade knife   What a guy   Makes you cry   135  Everybody shoved him, I very nearly loved him. I said, hey listen to me, Stay sane inside insanity. But he locked the door And threw away the key.  She collapses in tears.   What's it say, What's it say?   When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy You knew he was a no good kid.   What guy   Makes you cry   Eddie!   When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy You knew he was a no good kid.  But when he threatened your life With a switch blade knife   What a guy   Woe woe woe   Makes you cry   Hey hey hey     RIFF RAFF &amp; MAGENTA laugh.  JANET screams and runs to ROCKY who hugs her.  BRAD looks shocked.  DR. SCOTT wheels back his wheelchair in disgust, FRANK moves d.s. towards ROCKY.   Oh Rocky, how could you!  JANET runs out, FRANK in pursuit.  ROCKY smiles wanly.  Encouraged by this, FRANK smashes JANET across the face with the back of his hand.   I'll tell you once, Won't tell you twice You'd better wise up Janet Weiss.  Y'apple pie Don't taste too nice You'd better wise up Janet Weiss.  She runs out of room.   I've laid the seed It should be all you need.  BRAD appears, pushing DR SCOTT, in hot pursuit.  You're as sensual As a pencil Wound up like an 'E' or first string  JANET arrives at door of laboratory - she can't open it.  FRANK arrives face to face.   When we made it Did ya hear a bell ring?  The door opens - they fall through.  The door slams in DR SCOTT's face.    JANET rushes in, down the ramp, with FRANK in pursuit.   Y'got a block, Take my advice. You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss.  DR. SCOTT &amp; BRAD arrive in the lift.  FRANK has circled the tank and arrived at the control panel.   The transducer Will seduce yah.  DR. SCOTT, BRAD &amp; JANET find they are stuck to the floor.   My feet - I can' move my feet.   It's as if we were glued to the spot.   You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.   We're trapped.   It's something you'll Get used to. A mental mind fuck Can be nice.   Oh!  FRANK climbs up the ladder beside the tank.     You mean...   You mean he's gonna send us to another planet?  FRANK leaps off the tank to the floor.   Planet.  Schmanet.  Janet.  FRANK circles JANET, testing her thighs.  BRAD struggles in vain.   You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss. You'd better wise up, Build your thighs up. You'd better wise up.   Then she cries out -     Sto-o-o-o-o-op.  She cried so loudly that FRANK staggers backwards towards the control panel.  RIFF RAFF &amp; MAGENTA enter through the hole in the tiles - they march to behind the tank and then the control panel.   Don't get hot and flustered - Use a bit of mustard.   You're a hot dog But you'd better not Try to hurt her, Frank Furter.  FRANK signals to MAGENTA.  BCS MAGENTA's hand on the transducer switch.  BRAD is turned into a statute.   You're a hot dog...  FRANK signals.  C.S. SWITCH.  JANET is stone.       My God!  I can't take any more of this - first you spurn me for Eddie, then you cast him off like an old overcoat for Rocky.  You chew people up and then spit them out - I loved you, do you hear me - I LOVED YOU - And what did it get me - I'll tell you - a big nothing. You're like a sponge.  You take, take, take, take!  You drain others of their love and emotions.  Well, I've had enough. You've got to choose between me and Rocky - so named because of the rocks in his head.  FRANK throws a switch, she turns to stone.   It's not easy having a good time.  He crosses over to RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA  Even smiling makes my face ache.  RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA nod sympathetically.  He lies on the operating table.  They massage.   My children turn on me.  Rocky's behaving just as Eddie did.  Maybe I made a mistake in splitting his brain between the two of them.    When will we return to Transylvania? I grow weary of this world.   Magenta, I am indeed grateful to both you and your brother RIff Raff - you have both served me well - loyalty such as yours must be rewarded and you will discover when the mood takes me I can be quite generous.  MAGENTA betrays her resentment by digging her fingernails into his neck.   I ask for nothing, Master.  FRANK leaps up from the table.   And you shall receive it - in abundance.  Come.  We are ready for the floor show.  Our guests will be growing restless.  The lift moves downwards.  Left alone in the laboratory MAGENTA and RIFF RAFF smile at each other.  They make a special sign and leave by a secret passageway.   And so, by some extraordinary coincidence - fate it seems had decided that Brad and Janet should keep that appointment with their friend Dr Everett Scott.  But it was to be in a situation which none of them could have possibly foreseen.  And just a few hours after announcing their engagement, Brad and Janet had both tasted forbidden fruit.  This in itself was proof that their host was a man of little morals - and some persuasion.  What further indignities were they to be subjected to?  And what of the sonic transducer and floor show that had been spoken of?  What indeed?  From what had gone before, it was clear that this was to be no picnic.      FRANK is enjoying dressing the statues which are now on stage.  Each one is lovingly fitted with extravagant variations on the stocking and suspender belt variety of his own fantasies.    Footlights glowing on the curtains.    FRANK pulls a switch and the curtains open.    Red velvet curtains open to reveal statues in front of silver drapes. The floor is covered with a light mist.    FRANK beams and pulls lever.    COLUMBIA's statue comes to life.   It was great when it all began I was a regular Frank fan. But it was over when he had the plan To start working on a muscle-man. Now the only thing that gives me hope Is my love of a certain dope Rose tints my world keeps me Safe from my trouble and pain.    FRANK switches.ROCKY leaps to life.       It's beyond me Help me Mommy I'll be good you'll see Take this dream away What's this, let's see I feel sexy What's come over me Here it comes again.    JANET animates.  She behaves like a sex goddess, completely out of control, as if performing in a burlesque show.   I feel released Bad times deceased My confidence increased Reality is here The game has been disbanded My mind has been expanded It's a gas that Frankie's landed His lust is so sincere.    We PULL BACK on the whole stage.  The velvets open to reveal the 20th Century Fox logo as a stage set.  At the top of the staircase FRANK appears bathed in light.  He wears a dazzling version of the national costume and a chiffon cloak which billows in the breeze from a wind machine.  He is reminiscent of a 30's film star.   What ever happened to Fay Wray That delicate satin-draped frame As it clung to her thigh How I started to cry For I wanted to be dressed just the same.    The floor opens to reveal a swimming pool glistening with chlorine and glitter.  He beckons the GUESTS.  In their drugged state they comply with his every wish.    Give yourself over to absolutely pleasure Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh Erotic nightmares Beyond any measure And sensual daydreams To treasure forever.  FRANK enters the pool.  Can't you just see it. Can't you just see it.  They begin to immerse themselves in the pool.  161ADon't dream it.  Be it.   Don't dream it.  Be it.  DR SCOTT animates belatedly.  He observes the orgy occurring in the pool.   It's beyond me Help me Mo-ommy.  He is pulled back into the pool.  A thrilled JANET now emerges.   God bless Lilly Saint Cyr.  FRANK breaks through the water on a lift from ROCKY.     My my my my I'm a wild and an untamed thing. I'm a bee with a deadly sting. Get a hit and your mind goes ping. Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing. So let the party and the sounds rock on. Gonna shake it till the life has gone.  Rose tint my world Keep me safe from my trouble and pain.  FRANK dives into the pool.  During the chorus the whole group are diving in and out of the pool in a frenetic water ballet.   I'm a wild and an untamed thing I'm a bee with a deadly sting. Get a hit and your mind goes ping Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing.  They emerge from the pool and form a kick line.  So let the part and the sounds rock on Gonna shake it till the life has gone. Rose tint my world Keep me safe from my trouble and pain.    The doors at the opposite end of the ballroom open.    RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA now dressed in military style space suits, face FRANK from the opposite end of the ballroom.  They applaud slowly.  RIFF RAFF has a ray gun.  The characters on stage freeze - terrified.  It's a showdown across the ballroom.   Frank N. Furter It's all over Your mission is a failure.  FRANK looks stunned.  Your life style's too extreme.  FRANK is guilt-stricken.  I'm your new Commander. You are now my prisoner.  The GUESTS scramble for the safety of the wings.  We return to Transylvania  Prepare the transit beam.  MAGENTA turns to leave.   Wait!  I can explain.     On the day I went away.   Was all I had to say   Want to come again and stay   Smile and that will mean I may  He kicks on cloud projection.  Blue skies appear.   I've seen blue skies Through the tears in my eyes And I realise I'm going home I'm going home  FRANK falls on his knees.  Everywhere it's been the same   Like I'm outside in the rain   Free to try and find a game   Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.  DR SCOTT switches on wind machine.  I've seen blue skies Through the tears in my eyes And I realise I'm going home I'm going home. I'm going home.    MAGENTA who during all this has been filing her nails, looks up at FRANK who is in an attitude of supplication.   How sentimental.  RIFF RAFF moves slowly to the stage.   And also presumptuous of you.  You see when I said \"we\" were to return to Transylvania, I referred only to Magenta and myself.  FRANK looks appalled.  The GUESTS are deeply troubled, realising that they also are not part of the \"We\".   You see, you are to remain here, in spirit anyway.  He produces a ray gun.   Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.   You mean you're going to kill him? What's his crime?   Exactly, Dr Scott.  Now Frank N. Furter, your time has come.  Say goodbye to all this and hello to oblivion.  FRANK raises himself to his full height.   Do your worse - inferior one.  As RIFF RAFF pulls the trigger, COLUMBIA dashes between them.  She is killed instantly.  RIFF RAFF fires again at FRANK.  FRANK takes a leap fro the rope on the curtain.  The entire proscenium crashes under the weight.  And FRANK is crushed to death among the velvet and glittered facia.  ROCKY breaks down completely.  Although he despised FRANK, he was all he had in the world.  He rushes to the body and cradles it in his arms.  RIFF RAFF can stand no more.  He fires a blast of laser beam at ROCKY who starts climbing the stairway towards the fox skyline.  RIFF RAFF fires again and again.  With the body of FRANK in his arms, ROCKY beats on his chest and lets out a wild sound like a giant beast of the jungle.  RIFF RAFF fires a sustained beam.  ROCKY climbs to the top of the Fox sculpture.  RIFF RAFF fires again and again.  They crash to their deaths.   Good God.   Yes.   You've killed them.  MAGENTA has found the entire sequence of events quite distasteful.   I thought you liked them.  They liked you.   They didn't like me.  They never liked me.   A decision had to be made.   Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.   You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.  The GUESTS flee down the ballroom and out the door.  We see the laughing figures of RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA making a special sign to each other.    We see BRAD and JANET fleeing with DR SCOTT following behind.    RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA's laughter has subsided.   Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our \"androgenous\" planet.   Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...   But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.   And our World will do the Time Warp again.    There is a huge explosion.    We see the entire castle surrounded by a giant beam of light and then vanish into space.

    "description": "On a wild and rain-swept late-November evening, somewhere at an empty stretch of road outside Ohio's merry Denton, blissfully-affianced, prudish, boringly-innocent young pair Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) find themselves stranded on their way to visit an ex-tutor. Instead, the couple will inadvertently unearth the cross-dressing Dr. Frank-N-Furter's (Tim Curry's) spooky lair of inexhaustible oddities, just in time to partake in the out-of-this-world mad scientist's proud unveiling of his latest, delightfully extravagant, most daring creation: the ultimate male and the perfect sex symbol: the flaxen-haired Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood). But, little by little, as the effervescent transgressive force gobbles up whole the unsuspecting visitors of the night, Brad and Janet slowly begin to embrace the potent fascinations of seduction, while an idolized Rocky roams free in the mansion. Who can interrupt man's union with the absolute pleasure?—Nick Riganas",
