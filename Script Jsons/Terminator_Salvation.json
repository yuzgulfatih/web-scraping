        "Morrison": "Start up the generator, Barnes.  Son of a bitch is heavy.  How can he be?  Winning your trust would aid his infiltration.  We're trying to--  Then it's already too late. This used to be an ICBM silo, we're just trying to stay alive here. Your turn-- where'd you come from?  Not yet-- not for years. So, you're programmed with false memories, a human history--  You can skip the act, we know what you are.  Who does?  John Connor founded the Resistance. When the war began, no one even knew who the enemy was-- Connor taught us how to fight back. He saved humanity.  Nobody sees him. Skynet can't be allowed to discover his location, even his appearance is kept secret.  Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a chopper-- seems you're some kind of VIP.",
        "Marcus": "Yeah, I'm pretty much done with it.  Chosen?    Lucky me.  You don't need to be scared.  Cancer?  I'm a regular hero.  No one lives forever.  What can I say. I was seventeen, I was angry, I was stupid.  Hallelujah.  Hey!   Yo, over here!  Damn it's good to see you guys, I felt like I was the last man on...  Oh God...  You're human... you can see me, you can touch me. This place is real.  I thought I was in hell.  Those things with masks, red eyes--  If I'm not in hell, where am I?!  First put down the shotgun.  I don't wanna kill anyone.  I don't like it when people point guns at me.  You took on a guy like me with one bullet and an empty shotgun? Pretty stupid.  In the city.    That wasn't a helicopter...    What year is it?  Fifteen years... I've lost 15 years. So who did it to us? Terrorists? The Russians, the Chinese--?  The nukes. There was a war, right? Who started it?    That flying grapefruit, what was it?  Jalape√±o sauce.  No thanks.     Not hungry.  I look the same.  Oh yeah. Was about all I ever had to look forward to in the joint.    She your sister?    You don't know me.  Skynet runs the machines...?   So who's this John Connor?  Yeah, right. Him and Jesus.  You're asking the wrong guy.    Well... Nah, some of `em were all right. My little brother Max, pretty wild kid, not much older than you-- he stole a car, just joy-riding, y'know, showing off.  Cop chased him right into our front yard, pulled him outta the car... and started whaling on him, kicking the shit out of him. No reason for it, Max was already in cuffs. I ran out of the house, guy tried to pull his gun on me-- guess I just went off on him. Don't even remember it really... they say I broke his neck. Max must be dead too, now... like everybody else.  Sure.  The bible. My grandma always tried to get me into it, but-- it always put me to sleep. Still does.  \"...of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son Jephunneh--\"  \"Guaranteed lowest prices... open seven days...\"  It's a flower. A rose.     You know, pianos, guitars...  Come on. You must... \"I can't get no... satisfaction...\" \"We are family... I got all my sisters with me...\" No, huh. How about... \"Twinkle twinkle little star...\" \"How I wonder what you are... up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky...\"  You OK?  It's called driving.   Sure.    Pop the clutch! Let your foot up!  Sort of.  No!    You're doing fine.  Ssh.  Stop the car.  Other pedal, other pedal!  Damn it.    Empty.  What is this?  Spit it out!  Oops.  Name's Marcus.  I'm heading that way.  I've got to get to my friends--  Couple of kids. They were in that flying dumpster--  Hydrobots?  You're with the Resistance.  I don't know... this has gotta be some kind of, like, dream or hallucination. Like what happens to people right before they die...  Let's hear it.  What the hell for?  I've never seen trees like these.  Freaky.  What was that?  They're surrounding us.  Dog eat dog world.  Staf?   What's that mean?  I'm not gay. In prison, I thought about puss-- women all the time. But now... it's not working. Who knows, all those years on ice...  I dunno. They just... sorta reminded me of her.  There's a woman, the last woman I saw before... when I was under, the dead time-- she kept coming to me. I think she must've saved me.  We're in somebody's garden.  Over there.  Boo!  Get me the hell down from here!  Why are you doing this?    What is this place?  Corpus Christi. It's in Texas.     Or it was.  What are you talking about?  I'm a man!  Even if I never been treated like one.  Year after year after year on death row, I just wanted it to end! I cut my own wrists. But they nursed me back to health, `cause that wouldn't be fair, they needed to kill me themselves. For Chrissake, you all want me dead so bad-- just do it. Do it!  So this guy is what, like king of the world, or what's left of it?  Yeah, well, humanity's never done all that much for me. Why can't I see him?  This shit is ridiculous. What the hell do you want from me?  So do I! I don't know what I am, what I'm doing here, I don't know shit-- maybe I never did, but-- I'm sick of it! Just blow my head off or let me go.    You're out of your mind, aren't you?  Feels like I been here before... what are you gonna do to me?  Hello? Anyone there? I'm thirsty.  I need water.  Please, I'm--  Why are you doing this?  So what am I...?  You think they'll buy that?  I'm heading across the river.  I'm not human, remember?  It's the only thing I can think of that makes any sense...  For all I know, they're the reason I'm back from the dead.  Where's that go?  Thank you.  Don't mention it.  What the hell is this?  Among other things. Look, I'm trying to find some friends-- a couple of kids. They were taken here, I saw some buildings--  Marcus.  I didn't think there was-- anything like this left... anywhere.  This isn't food.  Terminators!  What are you?  A hybrid-- human and machine?  Jesus... why?  What about the ones who weren't?  Your family. You lost them?  Why are you smiling?  Tell me everything.   How did you people get here?  Angel-- what is it?  English!    Like fuck it is. I'm sick of being your guinea pig, what are you doing to me now?!  You all work for Skynet!  The end of the world.  Into-- this? A brain in a box?  Destroying the human race in order to save it.  What are you doing?  No, stop... I don't want it! You're dead inside, all of you!  I'm not sure I know how to describe it.  When I was a kid my grandmother would go on about heaven... it always sounded so boring.  A time machine... Connor was right.  ...I've just heard him speak.  In the world outside-- the survivors think Skynet is the enemy, out to destroy them. Why don't you tell them about all this?  Then why... Some people I knew were picked up, taken here...  Yes... what is this place?  That's them.  Of course.     I... I understand.  What is it?  I need to go back!  What do I do?  Let them go.  I said, let them go!  Now you're pissing me off.  How'd that feel?  I pull this off and you'll be in a world of pain!  Last chance. Let them out.  I'm gonna need your clothes.  We've gotta get out of here.  Stay down!  It's OK, I'm not human!  You can't drive!  I know.   Long story.  Take that path!  The trees!  You two all right?  There.  I'm sorry.  There are more prisoners, a complex about a mile in--  Yeah, well. Get in line.  I don't feel a thing.    Help somebody else.  They're not people anymore...  No!  No one lives forever.  I have no idea. I should be dead...    Yeah, simpler to keep it man versus machine.    I never really believed in heaven.  You're asking me to become... Him?  Why me?  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...",
        "Wright": "",
        "Kate": "He's not a cyborg-- no blood, no human tissue over the endoskeleton.  Where did they find him?  Because people trust you... you give them faith--   What is it, John?  What?   Find who?  All to find one teenage boy...? John, you really think this can work?  Your dad-- he seems like a nice kid.  He wants to see you.  Kyle, could you give us a minute?  Marcus... you're going to need to be rebuilt. Your face, your body, your voice... We have people who can do it.  But you won't be the same...  The scar will help hide the change.     Who else? Only you know the enemy from the inside. You liberated a Skynet camp... you're a hero.  Please.   We need you.",
        "Connor": "--hello-- standing by--  Not what I expected...  It does seem lifelike-- is the face able to mimic emotions--?    This isn't right. I can't be having a conversation with a terminator, Skynet isn't that sophisticated yet. Unless... were you sent here from the future?  Skynet's developing a time displacement field, we've decrypted recent data transmissions. I know for a fact that soon machines will be travelling back decades. To try and stop us from winning this war before it begins...  Jesus... I've seen enough. Stand by for further instructions.  Besides, the first T-800s won't be manufactured until `26.  I want him extracted.  Get him to our best people for disassembly, find out what makes him tick. We need to get into that metal skull, crack his CPU at all costs.  Kate, why did I become leader of the Resistance?  No. Because I knew I would be, I was told. I know when and where the major battles are going to take place. I know I'm going to send my own father back through time to save my mother-- even though I haven't met him yet. Christ, I even know the year I'm going to die...  So how could I not know about this?!  I need to talk to the prisoner.  Lieutenant Williams. I'm sorry about the way you've been treated, but we're forced to take every precaution. I'm John Connor.  At ease.   Please, sit.  I've gone over your record, lieutenant. You're a good soldier, flown a lot of missions... Why in God's name would you help a terminator escape?  We know he's crossed into Skynet territory, why would he do that if he isn't--  What friends?  Kyle.  Reese.  I always knew I'd have to find him someday. I just didn't know how.  My father.  What is it?  Mobilize a combined air and naval assault, all available resources. We're sending in a rescue team ASAP.  I'm standing here, I exist-- so it must have worked. We will find him.  Call it an act of faith.  John Connor. I'm glad you made it.  Seems I owe you an apology.  The last boatload is right behind me. Skynet's pouring in reinforcements, we can't hold this place. And the people in the houses, they won't leave--  This... this can't happen...  Her name was Sarah... she was... amazing...  Keep it.  You must.  I never knew how I was supposed to win this war. But I finally understand: the idea of John Connor is more important than the person. I can die. He cannot.",
        "Kyle": "What's your name?  Kyle Reese. She doesn't remember her name-- --so I call her Star.  Gonna be light soon, Marcus, better find cover. We spotted some buildings half a mile that way.  You can come if you want.    Nope.   Eighteen.  Yup.   Two thousand eighteen.  Something fall on your head? The machines did it, the computers-- they got smart.  What's the last thing you remember?  Eyeball.   Only one.  Aerostat-- one of Skynet's eyes. They patrol places like this, looking for survivors.  Any red ones?  Mm.    Ketchup.  So can I. Well, sort of... a little.  Never heard anyone say that before.  You ever watch television?  I remember TV a little.   Cartoons. It was great.  Dunno. Been together since we was little. Bunch of us kids was at the day-care center when the bombs fell... she and me are the only ones still around.  We're gonna find the Resistance, fight for John Connor against Skynet. You oughta join us, you're pretty cool.  You're strong, you can read... you didn't kill us. Good enough for me...  He's... I don't know. The best. Everybody talks about him. He's the one who's gonna save us.  Who's Jesus?    Were cops like terminators?  You gonna be here when I wake up?  Good.   Stay away from the windows.  If we get it to move, will you teach me to make it go?  Aerostat's coming!  Wow.   You're good.      We oughta find a place to hole up for the day...  You smell that?    We've landed.  I don't know...  We're stopping.    Twinkle, twinkle, little star...  Shh, keep singing.   The same thing is happening to Kyle.    He's no longer singing.   Stop it stop it STOP IT!  No!  Marcus!  Watch me!  Come on I was doing good!  Where are we going?  He's not real.  Kyle Reese.  I don't remember my mother.",

        "Barnes": "Somebody feed those things!  Blair? Good to see you. What's the password?  Close enough. Who's your friend?  Kinda dumb-ass, wandering around in a mine field.  It's too early for that military crap.  OK, if you keep walking straight you're gonna get blown all to hell... turn to your left and take, oh... five steps.  OK, face me now. Three steps.  Almost home. Turn to your right and take another five steps...  He was takin' bigger steps!  Shut up!   I told you to shut up!  It keeps talkin' at me. God this thing gives me the creeps.    She's right, let's just waste the damn thing--    Bullshit.    Machines don't drink.  Shut up, robot!  Where in hell'd you get these?  Kinda stale.  I'm on duty, you know.  Twinkies and moonshine. You trying to seduce me again?  What can I say? It's our duty to repopulate the planet.  C'mere.  You're so twentieth century...  Admit it, I'm the best you ever had...",

        "Blair": "Yo!   Up here!  Who are you--  You can put me down now, Marcus.  I've got an ELT, but I can't call for a rescue here. There's an outpost a few miles upriver-- not my favorite people in the world, but it's safe. Let's move.    What friends?  The Skynet transport? It was carrying people? Christ, we almost shot it down. There've been rumors about a concentration camp, but...  You can't get across-- river's fulla hydrobots--  They can't see, but they have killer sonar. They'll attack anything that moves or makes a sound. Even if you get past them, you'd be dead before you covered a hundred yards. If the terminators don't get you, the fallout will-- heavy rads all the way to the Gulf coast, nothing can live there.  Lt. Blair Williams, I fly for what used to be the Air National Guard.  Stupid bastards. Come on.  That snap you out of it?  Well hell, maybe you are dreaming. Do us all a favor and wake up already.  So let me get this straight, Marcus. There you are on death row, they stick a needle in your arm...  and the next thing you know, you're here. Since this ain't the resurrection, there's only one possibility.  Whatever they pumped into your veins just knocked you out. This Angel Project you signed up for-- there was a lotta cryogenic stuff going on before the bombs fell, they musta froze your ass.  Drug tests, medical experiments, organ harvesting, who knows? You said you had no family, no friends-- why let a body like yours go to waste?  We're in a mutation zone. I saw a two-headed squirrel here once--    Levels are tolerable now, but just. We can't spend the night here.  I didn't hear anything--  Skindogs.  They're smart. And they don't scare easy.  You saved my ass. Thanks.  Thanks.  It's not far, but we'll never get across the mine field at night. Might as well STAF till morning.  C'mere, it's cold. I don't bite.  It's a resistance term.    Sit tight and fuck.  You holding out for lipstick? Lingerie? Or am I not your... type?  Maybe it's just gonna take some time. Before you're completely thawed out.  What are these?  Who?  I can't compete with that.  Christ... there's supposed to be barbed wire along the edge.  Whatever you do, don't move. Yo! Morrison, Barnes! Can anybody hear me?! We're in the middle of the mine field.  Eat shit and die, Barnes!  Could you get us outta here please?  You didn't maintain the perimeter! Where are your sentries?  You goddamn idiot!  What are you doing?  I don't think so.  Whatever he is-- he's on our side--  He saved my life!  What do you want from me-- I didn't know!  Leave him alone! Marcus, I'm so sorry...  How's it going, Barnes? Thought you might like a late-night snack.  We got a stash back at the base.  You need something to wash it down.  You know I always liked you, Barnes.   I just didn't want to join the harem.  Noble of you to make the sacrifice.  I prefer a little privacy.  Men.   You're all talk.  I used up the last of my Valium for you... Hold out your arms.  I don't believe you're a terminator.  Whatever you are-- I owe you one. Once you're free, I'll lie down next to Barnes-- they'll assume you escaped while we were passed out--  Worth a shot. Marcus, Command wants to take you apart, cut open your head. One thing I know, you're alive-- and you've got a right to live.  They're already here for you--  Hide in the forest, then aim west for open country--  No human being can survive there--  You're gonna try and save those kids.  Marcus, for all you know, they're dead already--  Damn it, we're too late--  Should lead out, but there's no way past the fan--  Here. My ELT-- emergency locator transmitter. If you find the camp, activate it like this. It could really help the Resistance.  Sir.  Sir-- he isn't a terminator.     He's human.  He's trying to find his friends.  A couple of kids. They were taken in a Skynet transport, probably to some kind of prison camp-- he said their names were Star and Kyle.  Mm... Kyle something.    With an `R.'  That's it.     How did you...?  Marcus... I need to head back to my unit.  What about you?  We've been ordered not to talk about it-- the hybrids, everything about that place is top secret...  How could you give that up?  Here.   You need these more than I do.",
