        "Lorenzo": "The man himself - a 20 year veteran of bureaucratic wars that have earned him this little kingdom - rises behind his desk.    Captain Lorenzo.  Yeah, I know. You think that LA badge is gonna get you a free lunch or something down here?  In an airport Christmas week? You gotta be kidding.  And what do we do with all the luggage for all the airplanes while we play Charlie Chan?  Oh. And meanwhile every hour a few more thousand people come and they want to put their luggage on airplanes, so we store them and their luggage in some other \"somewhere\"? Hell, why don't we shut down the whole fucking airport? Whaddya think they'll say upstairs when I tell them that?  Because I don't need a forensics investigation to file away some punk stealing luggage -  You'd be surprised what I earn in a month.     Now get the hell out of my office before I have you thrown out of my airport! McClane moves towards the door, his hands waving off the would be bouncers.  -well, the press was here, crawling all over the Esperanza story... so they got it right on the fucking news, bloodstains and all...  L.A., Mr. Lorenzo-don't mean shit-  What? You're buying into this -   I got it.  Maybe we should call the power company...?  How could they know already -?  They're talking to us on our own Goddamn system! They gotta be close - I'll have my men tear this airport  McClane, I got a first class unit here, SWAT team and all, and we don't need any Monday morning quarterbacks.   Security!  You're out of here! And already two big Airport cops are trotting over. As Trudeau REACTS, unsure -  Mr. Trudeau. Do I have to remind you about FAA regulations regarding unauthorized personnel in the control tower?  Oh, no, no way -  Lobby Security, come in.  And Lorenzo here, with two unauthorized personnel in the fucking tower! Get your thumb out of your ass and get over to the elevator. Get them out and post a guard or you're gonna have a pink slip in your Christmas stocking! Rattled, the guard signals a comrade, hustles to obey.   I want my Swat team to go with him as cover.  Whatever we can think of - they can think of, too. He says it like he thought of it himself. Then -  He's bluffing - Lorenzo leaves. Trudeau ain't so sure.     Through the annex skywalk to the new terminal... that way nobody sees them, we don't have any panic.  McClane! Keep out of this! You- He stops, seeing the chilling look Trudeau is giving him.           You're where - you crazy idiot, why' didn't you -  McClane, what the hell do you think you're doing, playing John Wayne? How'd you like to spend the rest of the night in a cell -     You can't talk to me like that -  Hey. Where the fuck is McClane?     McClane! Are you out of your fucking mind-?  Who the fuck are you?  They left to shoot those bastards out of the sky -  But - that firefight at the house-  You're completely around the fucking bend, McClane. And you know what else?  You're under arrest - McClane steps back - raises the assault rifle - FIRES. j ï¿½ï¿½ 3 21 NEW ANGLE 321 Lorenzo STAGGERS back in shock - and then realizes he's  Wha - how -  Holy shit - This is Chief Lorenzo. I want every officer recalled now and assembled in body armor with full weaponry in the motor pool in five minutes! It's time to kick ass! He slams the phone down - checks his pistol ammo and rushes out the door - a startled - and appreciative - McClane beside him!      Move that piece of shit! Henderson, get some crowd control! Goddamn it, clear the area-! thru OMITTED thru",
        "Esperanza": "Dios, los calambres!  Muchacho, si possible a removar eses?  De donde a yo caminar, si? The young guard shakes his head.  Bueno, joven, bueno! Tu eres un soldado excelente! Ahora, en vez del libertad - dame un fosforo? Flattered, the kid lights him up.        Capitain, please tell the tower you will proceed as ordered.        Repeat, I have lost cabin pressure. Near zero visibility. I must drop out of the storm. I can land but I must land now, on the first outgoing runway. Repea , I cannot circle around to runway fifteen. PULLBACK. McClane listens, grinning. He takes the airport map from his pocket, hands it the Marvin.     Thank you for telling me, Eagle Nest. But if you could show it to me as well I would be grateful. In the church, Stuart grins at Esperanza's coo]., signals Thompson. A switch is THROWN. The FIRST RUNWAY goes OFF and a NEW RUNWAY lights up DIRECTLY IN FRONT of the plane.  Gracias', Amigos.  Eagle Nest, do you copy? I'm coming down, now.      W-who are you?  No. NcClane 'DIVES and rolls into the cabin - FIRES TWICE out the door and then almost on instinct whirls - Esperanza's snatched up the rifle from the dead corporal but McClane's SHOT hits him in the SHOULDER. With a HOWL, Esperanza falls backwards but hangs on to the gun.   I'm all right - he said he was a ,policeman...  Thank you, Major. Save them until we are all safe - and excuse a left handed salute, eh?    The aerilons! Something's wrong -we can't take off -  he TURNS the PLANE. Now he's ON THE RUNWAY PROPER.  sees this, smiles -  RESPONDS to the cry, GUNS IT -  TURNS at the EXPLOSION in time for a WALL OF FIRE that SHOOTS UP THE WING and through the cockpit FLOOR, and then he's ON FIRE",
        "Grant": "We're the Triple T's. I'm Major Grant. i JUSTICE MAN Rollins. Department of Justice.  One crisis... one dozen. Who are you?  McClane... Oh, yeah, you're the one who tried to save that plane tonight. You showed some balls out there, McClane. Now show some sense and let the pros handle things.     cto his men All right, hustle! Command post will be in the Airport Police office. I want to be tied into the Tower and every sysytem that's still working in fifteen minutes!   Trudeau. Lorenzo. You brief me on that plane he asked for, I'll fill you in on my orders. In my office. Now. \"My office\" meaning Lorenzo's. Lorenzo glowers at that, but the little group moves in that direction - then the JUSTICE GUY puts up his hand to block McClane -  McClane, we don't need a loose cannon on this deck. What if they decide to crash another plane in retaliation for your little stunt?  Maybe they're more creative than you  Gentlemen. We have... a situation here... CLICK CLICK SNAP. AMMO CLIPS are broken out - all PIGGYBACKED like combat hardened troops do it, two banana clips taped together with blue tape.    Oh, no, Carmine? Sergeant! Get this... bureaucrat out of Mr. McClane's face.  i No, you were right. I'm just your- kind of asshole.  Close up the back, then we go in. Fire only on my order. McClane and Barnes watch as the soldiers start to close the net.     Evacuate! Now!     If you remember me, Colonel, you'll remember I know the drill as well as you do. Check out your own fucking plane. We move out in five minutes. Body armor for everyone - full metal jackets. We will take them in the hanger or we will shoot that fucking plane out of the sky. Lorenzo, take your men back to the airport and seal off every exit in case anyone tries to break out on the ground.  Grenada - five minutes of firefight five weeks of surfing! LAUGHTER, which SUBSIDES a bit as Grant looks at his watch.. a look DUPLICATED by the others.  So do we, kid.  Yeah. Then we wouldn't have to do this. And in a flash, Grant DRAWS his combat knife and SLITS the kid's throat! Telford FLOPS BACK off the bench. Grant is already digging into the cargo pocket of his trousers and he comes out with a transceiver - the same distinctive scrambled transceiver used by Stuarts men!     My position is I'm gonna get my ass reamed out by the best Goddamn soldier on the planet 'cause I'm two minutes late. Stuart GRINS, signals for the hanger door to be opened.  Congratulations on your escape, sir.   I've had enough fucking snow for a lifetime.     Each HOLDING ON TO THE WING with one hand - FIGHTING with the other - Grant POUNDS AWAY on McClane's face - but McClane doesn't HIT BACK - he just GRINS like a maniac - PUSHES Grant -pushes -pushes -  (through his teeth, as     too late, he realizes he's over the front edge of the wing! He screams and FALLS -",
        "Trudeau": "lighting a cigarette, he hovers over BARNES.  Weather may have screwed up the line. Switch over to our own back up and run a check. Barnes hits a switch. The ALARM STOPS. Everyone relaxes.  Couldn't be helped, I guess. What was it, gangs?  Who the hell is this?  That's what I said about my last cholesterol test. What's your problem- Lieutenant McClane?  Hey. Something serious happens every night, only it doesn't make the newspapers. Ever see those guys on TV, juggling knives and cha n i saws? That's what we're doing with those planes up there, only we do it one handed 'cause the other hand's playing 3 card monte with the planes on the ground.  One way we manage the planes. But we've got backup - Long look from McClane.   The human element..?   Lorenzo. Have all your shift Commanders report in... now.  I want them to report anything out of the ordinary --no matter how trivial. You got that?  What is it?  Go to emegency lighting... now!  Shunt to another terminal!  We're on the same Goddamn grid and we're hot! Already the SPEAKER BOXES are beginning to CHATTER -   Jacoby, Strauss. Get your controllers on the horn - every plane approaching our Vortacs that's not in our pattern yet gets turned away'now. Everyone already inside our patrn holds at the outer marker. Stack 'em, pack 'em, and rack 'em. Move.  I want every off duty controller and technician here in five minutes. Page the terminal - no, better, beep them. McClane. This what you were expecting?   Put it on speaker.  How. did you get on this line? Who is this?     This is off limits, Coleman, you know that! Together with McClane she's shoved into the elevator.  Get what you need. Borrow, steal, kill.      Put me on all bands... Trudeau waits as switches are thrown, and then takes the jack from the ear/phone he wears and jacks it into a panel.  This is Dulles approach to all aircraft holding.at Potomic Vortac. We are experiencing... Severe technical problems here.  Our NAV and Approach systems are down and we expect to lose voice in another minute. We want you to continue holding at the outer marker as directed and wait for further instructions. As - as soon as we're back on line we'll expedite your landings on a.fuel emergency basis. Good luck... God bless. He turns to a tech, face ashen.  Okay. Change the boards.  And we don't want any disasters. Barnes has five minutes to check out that antenna array.  The son-of-a-bitch... the Goddamn son-of-a-bitch- I'll bet. Okay, calibrate your altimeter at setting MCCLANE'S VOICE two-nine-nine-two. Turning  That's the runway between here and the new terminal... he wants to make all of.us watch it.  Oh, God...no...  Everything's dead.  Christ. It's McClane. He'll get himself killed -  Barnes. We have to warn those planes we got a lunatic down here who likes to pretend he's the tower. Get up to the cab and get us on the air.  With your Goddamn brain! Barnes leaves. McClane blinks, coming around to reality. Sees Trudeau.  You don't have to say anything, McClane. We all know how you feel.   Our own SWAT team's gone. We called the Government for help. They're sending in a special Army unit. Tactical Terrorist Team... McClane sees something else there in his eyes.  Your wife's plane...?  They keep broadcasting, even though we can't answer. They... they'll run out of fuel in 90 minutes. CAMERA PUSHES IN on McClane.     Obey.  It is. It's in hanger eleven. That's the most remote building we've got. Stuart looks at his map, then the hanger mentioned; not far.  Quite clear.  Christ - that fucking asshole -  Negative, one fourteen, our.situation is unchanged.  I-I didn't mean any harm - I just wanted ratings - I had to do it it was sweeps week -  They already know. Listen. And sure enough, there it is - the SOUND of ENGINES -",

INFORMATION GIRL may be here for a while, if that new storm front moves Right over there. to the Metro area this McClane nods, serves across the slick linoleum.  he fairly SKIDS to a halt at a line of PHONE BOOTHS - and outside each booth a long LINE of people with their armfuls of luggage       Hello. This is Lieutenant McClane - Somebody there beep me?  Holly! Did you land?  As far as I'm concerned, progress peaked with the frozen pizza.  Just speeding on sugar, thanks to your parents. I really appreciate you coming a day late, honey. Nothing I like better than a weekend with the Munsters.     Coming out of the phone booth and almost COLLIDING with -  --do I know you?  You and me both, pal. The hell with it. Now it's Stuart's turn to look at McClane oddly; then he moves off. McClane looks after him, trying to place him... shrugs... heads for the bar.  This gets his attention. His eyes narrow. He looks from the two or d inary looking men towards the Airport cops, wonders why they got fidgety. Now he watches  turns to watch them exit, sees them SPLIT up outside the bar. Quickly, McClane goes over to the Airport cops.  Excuse me, officers. This may be a total wild goose chase, but I think I just saw - He STOPS. CAMERA ADJUSTS. The cop he's talking to is the asshole who towed away the car.  Elvis. McClane turns, throws money near his glass and quickly exits the bar.  Open this.  Got a cop on duty around here?     Excuse me.  This is a restricted area. You boys too impatient to wait for the skycaps?  Drops from the belt, crouches near big gears. Desperate, he looks around for a weapon, anything. Then he notices all the luggage going past: Suitcases, camera cases, a bicycle... Skis.  Fighting hand to hand. Miller starts pressing the ski pole against McClane's throat:-Pt=lane tries to do the same thine back - they spin, SMASH into a pile of suitcases, some of which  Half on the belt, half off, he fends off the other man and SEES-  WINCES as blood SPLATTERS - and then REACTS as the 20 foot tall conduit pipe CREAKS, BENDS-TOPPLES- he RIDES IT DOWN-     Cleveland?  One of the cops hands McClane his wallet. As he pockets it, he notes the CROWD milling about the luggage area.  Whoa, wait a second. This is a crime scene. Aren't you going to seal off this area?  Up to the Captain? Take me up to the Captain, too.  Lorenzo?     No. Just a little professional courtesy.  Okay. Forget the courtesy. How about lust the professional? Your boys dust walked away from a crime scene - you need to seal it off, get a forensics team in, dust it, shoot  You store them somewhere -  Why don't you try it and find out?  Luggage? That \"punk\" pulled a Glock Seven on me. Know what that is? A porcelain gun from Germany. It doesn't show up on airport x-ray machines... and it costs more than you earn in a month.  If it's more than a dollar eighty nine, yeah -   One question, Carmine: Which sets off the metal detectors first: The shit in your brains, or the lead in your ass?  Excuse me. He reaches over, gently takes typing paper and a stamp pad.  Whoa, guys. (ver quickly showing   Didn't you ever have an airport stiff  Yup, he's dead,. all right. Thanks. And he's gone as they look after him, puzzled.  Excuse me, honey - can I borrow your office for a minute? Before she can answer, he's over the counter and reaching for her phone.    Hey, partner. Get that twinky out of your mouth and grab a pencil.  Vacation? Holly stood me up for a last minute meeting. I'm alone in DC with the in-laws.  R' ht. Listen, Al, what's our FAX n u mber in the station there?  Yeah, well my wife's company makes 'em, I figure it's time to get one of them pregnant.  This way? This way. The FAX starts to leave McClane - voila, it's already arriving at Powell's office.  From a stiff down here at Dulles. I marked the whorls with a pen in case the transmission's fuzzy. Can you run that through State and Federal for me - throw in Interpol if you got it.  I don't know. Just a feeling.  The FAX number is uh -        Al?  What can you tell me?  You needed a computer for that?  What?  Yeah, I see it. Thanks a lot, Al. I owe you. He hangs up. The girl gives him the eye.   Just the FAX,, ma'am. Just the FAX.  Depends who you are.  Yeah. Now he's on the Network interviewing Transsexual Gum Surgeons and laughing all the way to the bank.  Nah. I do needlepoint. And he's at the end of the walkway and he quickly disappears into the crowd, leaving Sam pissed, puzzled... and out of breath.  Yeah... if your gangs get their training at Fort Bragg.   I'm a police officer, Mr. Trudeau-  I think something serious is going to happen here tonight -  Anybody try and fix the deck tonight?  Anything weird going on besides the shooting?  What's that?  Okay. You clot back-up - back-up for everything you think can go wrong. What about something nobody anticipated? Not accidents, not  Damned straight the human element. You've got the world's biggest drug dealer on the way, one body and a'- lot of questionsl Doesn't anyone want to look for answers?  Jesus...  This? This ain't it, pal. This is just the beginning. A PHONE RINGS. CAMERA ADJUSTS. It's a prominent RED PHONE.  Maybe they don't. Maybe... it's them.  Esperanza? Trudeau nods -  As Trudeau tries to make headway with Stuart, McClave leans over to Barnes.  What's all that about?  Meaning they pull Esperanza off his plane and take him anywhere there's no extradition treaties.  About time, Carmine. Guess you have to light a fire under your ass to light a fire under your ass.   Monday morning? My wife's on one of those planes these aasstards are fucking with! That makes me a player on the fucking field, you putz! And if you got off your fat ass when I told you to, maybe we wouldn't be knee deep in shit right now!   Trudeau, can't you see you're dealing with pros? You can't fuck with these  Anything you can think-of, they'll think of, too! But the elevator DOORS CLOSE on him and now Lorenzo turns a KEY on the control panel, then SPEAKS into his walkie talkie.  Shit!  (opening the control      I don't believe this... another fucking elevator... another fucking basement... why does this always happen to me? He moves through the cavernous maze, and then REACTS to MUSIC. Moves towards it. And arrives in -  Who the fuck are you? In response, the man points to the NAMETAG on his coveralls.  You're what, the janitor?     Come on, Marvin. I wasn't born yesterday. Carmine Lorenzo know you don't go home after you punch out?  I'm a veteran myself, Marvin. And a married one. You married?  My wife may be in some trouble upstairs. I gotta find out. This set up of yours? I won't tell a soul... provided you patch me into this panel, 'let me eavesdrop on the tower. What do you say?   Christ. They're gonna try something cute... where's this annex skywalk?   Shit, it's a fucking bottleneck. Anybody smart enough to shut down the airport is smart enough to figure this... it's a perfect place for an ambush...  Tunnels.  Looks like... maybe a mile. Easy jog.  Whoa.  I owe you one, Marvin. How about a sixpack of malt liquor?  McClane moves forward - stops immediately. Looks up at Marvin, who GRINS.  He's HIGH ABOVE the huge boiler room. The only way across is on a narrow beam.  in the TUNNELS, he tosses off his sweater into the darkness. Underneath, his shirt is already sweat-stained. And then he HEARS the gunfire - it's close! He gets his bearings -LUNGES through a wall of STEAM -  deliberately SMASHES into the cross bars he passes, one after another, the SMACK of his body into them sounding like linebackers in combat -  has a moment of satisfaction - then  Oh, fuck  lands, HARD, the plywood boards from the top of the scaffold SWEEPING him off his feet - his gun SKITTERS across the linoleum towards the far end of the slidewalk - he rolls over and SEES  You okay?.      Time you don't have... Time they don't have.  What...?  So are you. Break the code -  They HEAR this too, over Barne's cellular tie in to the tower. McClane grabs it.  There's five dead officers here, Colonel Stuart - Isn't that penalty enough?  Yeah, Colonel. We were both famous for five minutes. Saw you get shit canned by Congress on TV. How much drug money is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor?  And lesson one starts with killing policemen? What's lesson two - the Neutron bomb?  both ashen faced -  Christ, helsbringing them You're cleared for approach  CAMERA PUSHES IN on him as he turns and looks out the window.     Barnes holds one end of.a painter's dropcloth; McClane - now wearing Barne's coat - DROPS out the broken window to the snow below. There he's a tiny SHADOW on the white field. He turns, RUNS across the. unlit airport... wind whipped SNOW quickly hiding him from Barnes.  He's made two TORCHES from wads of fabric wound on the scaffold pieces - now he uses his LIGHTER to ignite them. He WAVES the impromtu FLARES in a crazy pattern - We HEAR the approaching  Now he can HEAR the plane's ENGINES and - for a fleeting MOMENT he SEES its LIGHTS between gusts of snow-  No... no, Jesus, Mary, Mother of God,  Behind the plane, watching the fireball roll away from him. He gives the scream of an. animal in a trap and falls to his knees.  Relax, pal, I'm not a survivor. I'm just another victim. He grabs the rescue worker by the collar.  .the last fucking victim he'll ever have.  Trudeau... I... I...  Do you? Do you? I've been a cop 13 years... Everything from... lost kids to hostages... but... all of it was... taking care of business... taking care of peoplle... until tonight. Tonight, everything I did, everything I tried... I never felt so useless.  And...?     John McClane.  Unfortunately the pros are on the other side. Colonel Stuart is one of your boys -      Trudeau.  Did things just get better... or worse?  That's all we keep hearing. Can you do anything with it?   My wife has less than two.  Except Colonel Stuart? The kid can't answer. Then Grant appears, the MAN from the Justice Department in tow.  They kind of busted me down to buck private.     The code... the code's still punched... where did you get this?  How about I let you live?

Come to poppa, you son-of-a-bitch- He flies up the ladder - and BRUISES his shoulder against the locked grid.  Shit!  It's.coming, coming, COMING. Desperate, McClane sees that part of the rifle is half under the grid. Now, he puts all his energy into levering the rifle against the steel. Slowly, slowly, sweat breaking out on his forehead, he levers the rifle higher and higher, the rifle in turn levering the grid upward, an inch at a time finally, it's high enough for him to JAM the rifle's bayonet ring into the grid while the cheek notch of the stock perches precariously on the lip of the hole.  Not yet. McClane's FIST smacks in, knocking Esperanza back from the door.  Thought you'd pull this off, didn't you? I guess you didn't count on me being here. Actually, I didn't count on me being here.  Just a cop who's spent half his career busting scumbag lowlife dope dealers. Looks like it's business as usual. Think this will look good on my record?

Barnes reaches inside his jacket, fumbles in his jammed plastic pocket thingie for a little flashlight. He checks the map.

Attention, Dulles Tower. Attention, Dulles Tower -     Who I am is unimportant. What I want... well, if you don't want those planes overhead to start dropping like flies when they run out of fuel... what I want is very important. All REACT - McClane as much as anyone.  A plane is going to be landing at this Airport in 58 minutes. It is FM 1 - Foreign Military 1.  This plane is scheduled to be met by a continigent from the U.S. Justice-department. But now there will be a change of plans. This plane will not be met by anyone. It will land on a runway of my designation where it will not be molested. That will conclude my interest in that plane and your responsibility for it. At the same time, I want a 747 cargo conversion fully fueled.  Attention, Tower. You have two more minutes to stack the planes in your inbound pattern over your outside radio marker. After that you will be able.to receive only. Any attempt to restore your systems will be met by severe penalties. At the elevator, Lorenzo pauses - stage WHISPERS -  I am doing this.  Except losing our own team wasn't part of the plan. He comes to a decision. Picks up the phone. Speaks. Voice flat, firm, stern. Around and above him, his men hover over the improvised screens and terminals.  Attention, Dulles. You were warned not to try and restore your systems.  You've wasted lives and time on a futile and obvious target. Now you have to pay the penalty.  has reacted to both the mention of his name and of McClane's. His brow furrows. Ah, yes.  McClave? John McClane? The... policeman hero who saved the Nakatomi hostages? I read about you in People magazine. You seemed out of your league on Nightline, though...  I think Cardinal Richlieu said it best: Treason is merely a matter of dates. And this country has to learn it can't keep cutting the legs off men. like General Esperanza -men with the guts to stand up to Soviet agression.  I think we can find something in between.  Give me a flight number - one low on fuel. Another man hands him a slip of paper. He reads it, switches to another mike .  Windsor flight one-four-teen, this is Dulles Approach... do you copy?

He looks back at the mini-FIREBALL, signals his men to regroup. All DWINDLE in the landscape of the empty airfield.     We're on our way. If there's another attempt to stop us like the one-you just made, I will fire several Stinger missiles into your terminal. Do I make myself clear?  Good.

Interested, McClane'follows Barnes around the corner.  These are the old plans when the longer runways went in... that's twelve years ago. And it looks like they did some modifications on site... moved Tracon, phone, ILS - all the underground stuff -so they could handle drainage.
