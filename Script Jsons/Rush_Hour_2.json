        "Ricky": "I'm busy at the moment.   I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?   Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.   I don't think so...  A nod of Ricky Tan's head, and TEN LARGE MEN in robes and towels spring out of reclining chairs -- menacingly facing Lee and Carter.  A beat...   It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.   Congratulations.  And good day.  As Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him. But they are blocked by TAN'S MEN.  Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off.  The man covers his naked body.  Lee is grabbed by one of the other henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms -- blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel, his robe, or some other found object.  Carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men flying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them.    It looks like HUGH HEFNER'S BEDROOM complete with ROUND BED and SUNKEN BAR.  Ricky Tan sits in front of a big screen satellite TV screaming at the Lakers.  Hu Li opens the door and the bodyguards lead Lee into the bedroom.   Come on, Shaq, hit a damn free-throw! You can do it, big guy.   Shit!  He still doesn't follow through. I just lost five grand.  Tan turns off the TV, turns to Lee.   Why don't we go on the deck, get some air...and some privacy.  Leave us alone.  Hu Li hesitates, upset at being dismissed.    Could you have your partner wait for us outside?    Tan and Lee reach the upper deck, where they are alone.   Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --   ... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.   Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.   There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...  Hu Li BURSTS onto the deck, flanked by FOUR BODYGUARDS.  Ricky Tan screams something at Hu Li in Chinese.  Hu Li screams back as SHE EMPTIES HER GUN INTO RICKY'S CHEST.  Tan falls back, over the rail, and into the water.  Lee MOVES TOWARDS HU LI, but the four bodyguards are on Lee, attacking from all sides.  Hu Li exits as Lee tries to fight off the bodyguards.    Reactions from the crowd as GUNSHOTS echo from the deck above.   Imagine a business where people hand you money.  And you hand them back absolutely nothing.  Ricky Tan - alive and well, turns around and stares at Lee. Isabella is standing next to him.  Lee is shocked at the sight of Ricky Tan alive.   Now that's a true American dream. Thanks to a few pieces of metal and a very greed driven US Customs agent.  Ricky Tan walks toward Lee, starts to smile.   Look at you, you're ridiculous.  You know it didn't have to be like this. But it's too bad!  Like father, like son.  Lee stares at Isabella for a BEAT.  Hu Li motions to one of the monitors.   Look at this old fool, what does he think he's doing?  Ricky Tan shifts his attention back to Lee.   It's almost impossible to find a partner that's trustworthy and loyal.  Wouldn't you agree, Lee?   Well, at least you will die with honor. But choy Gien.  SUBTITLES: \"Won't see you again.\"   Chai Hu Li.  Have fun.  Ricky Tan walks out.  Hu Li holds the detonator up to Lee, plays with the button.   American's love to gamble.  Don't they, Mr. Reign?   And my plates?   I enjoyed that little story you told about the Dragon and the treasure.  My mother used to tell it to me all the time.  Do you know the moral of that story, Mr. Reign?   I hate that fortune cookie shit.  Lee BURSTS through the suite door - watches as Reign falls dead to the floor.  Ricky takes the black bag off the desk.   You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.   I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.  Ricky glances at the gun in Reign's belt.   Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.  Ricky makes a play for the gun, but Lee is much too fast, taking the gun and pushing Ricky against the wall just as Carter bursts in the room.   Would you like me to tell you how your father died?   He never begged for his life.  Or tried to make a deal.  All that he asked me, just seconds before I pulled the trigger, was that I promise not to kill you.  Lee's finger is on the trigger -- he wants to pull the trigger but can't.   Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?   That's what I thought.  Tan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee -- the plates hit him across the face and knock him down.",

        "Lee": "The passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in a Chinese-cut suit.  He's holding a Chinese-English dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best \"do me\" look to two girls in a convertible.    ...wish they all could be California... wish they all could be California girls...  Carter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it out of the SUNROOF.   That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.   Those girls drove off because of you.   You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.   You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.   Mu-shu?  You're hungry?     Any leads?   It's my responsibility.  Lee hangs up the cell phone.   Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.   Carter, would I lie to you?   No.   No.   I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.   Bathroom.  Lee walks off, trying not to be seen as Carter steps up to the bar, takes a seat next to TWO CHINESE THUGS.    Carter, get off that stage!   This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.   I'm sorry.   No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.   Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.   No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.   You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.    They're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives.  Hu Li looks down at them.  She has no weapon to finish them off. She turns and runs, disappearing in the night.    holding on with all their strength.  The bamboo is starting to bend.   Try to land on your feet.  Carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them.    Carter and Lee drive through Hong Kong, the two men riding in silence, bruised and covered in garbage.   I'm sorry.   No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.  Carter takes this in.  Can't believe his own bad luck.   This won't take long.  Master Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES.    Yes, Master.  While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12 YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle.  Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up.   I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.   Ricky Tan?   How do I find Ricky Tan?  AGAIN IN THE B.G., Carter and the flying kids go zipping by in the other direction, disappear O.S.  Master Fu pats the SOIL around a struggling plant.   I know, Master, but...   Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --   Carter...you ready to have some fun!?   Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.    Hello.   My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.   What are you doing?   Well, hurry up.   Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.   This is a very dangerous man.   I'm calling for back up!  Lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits.  Carter looks at RICKY TAN -- sitting quietly in his chair with his LAPTOP COMPUTER on his knees.  Carter makes a decision, gets up and walks towards him.   You must come with me for questioning.   Don't look at my ass!    The shades are down as Lee frantically gets dressed, putting on a suit and fixing his tie. Carter finishes putting on a BLACK CHINESE STYLE SUIT from Lee's closet, then moves for the door.   Where are you going?   Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.   Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!   It's my job!   I have plenty of dates.   You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.   The Secret Service?  Why?   How can we help?   I can get to Ricky Tan.    Carter is on the phone, his feet on Lee's desk.  As he talks he opens a drawer, pulls out a wad of cash and pockets it.    Lee walks out of the Captain's office, heads for his own office - but never gets there.  AN EXPLOSION rips through the second floor of the station. Lee diving for safety as glass and debris shoot over his head.  Sheer pandemonium as Lee quickly looks up at his destroyed office, tries to get to his feet.  STUNNED POLICE OFFICERS and DETECTIVES are crowded around Lee's office, looking at the rubble.  Lee pushes through the crowd -- it's all smoke and fire.  Now way anyone held back by the heat.   Carter!  CARTER!   All he wanted was some mu-shu.   I'm sorry, I have to go.    Lee drives, misty-eyed.  RAP MUSIC playing over the stereo. Lee turns it up, slowly moving his head to the music, in tribute to Carter.  His CELL PHONE rings, he turns down the music.   Did you tell Sterling?   Thank you.  Lee hangs up.  A look of intensity.  He CRANKS the RAP MUSIC up, a man on a mission.   Ricky Tan.  Where is he?   The Hong Kong Police.  He killed a detective today and he's not getting away with it.  Now where is he?   Carter?   You.   Not Yu.  You!   Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?    I'll meet you on the main deck in ten minutes.  Carter pulls Lee aside.   I'm okay, you go.   Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.   Don't.  Ricky Tan hears the steel in Lee's voice, acknowledges it.   The police can protect you.   Tell me why they killed the customs agents.   Hu Li!  Lee runs to the rail -- looks down to see a SPEEDBOAT starting to pull away from the ship.  Hu Li jumps onboard the moving boat.  Lee starts to turn for the stairs, running down towards the stern.   I'll take him.   Don't push me, Carter.  I'm in no mood for your bullshit.  Carter gets in Lee's face.  The two men look like they're about to come to blows.   I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.   Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!   No.  She's a school teacher.   Good at what?   Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.   Ricky Tan killed my father.  Carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to Lee.   He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.   All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.   No, no, that would be crazy --   I thought you'd think it was crazy.   I know.  I know.  I am sorry.  Lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his car.  Carter watches him.  Finally he rolls his eyes and yells.   What?   I cannot go to LA...  Carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the cop beneath the attitude.   You said --   Why LA?   I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...   Follow the Rich White Man?   Follow the RichWhiteMan...   Who?   How do you know he's our man?   You sound like that all the time.   Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.   Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.   He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.   How do you know?   Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.   The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.   My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.   It's a long story.   No.  It was my singing.   She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.  Carter stares at Lee for a long BEAT.   She's just standing around -- not doing much.   I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.  Isabella starts to remove her blouse.  Lee starting to sweat as he watches her undress.   Slow down, baby.   Nothing.  I said nothing.  Lee lowers his binoculars, steps away from the window.   Is it hot in here?   I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?   She's getting undressed.   No.  It's not right.   What's she doing?   I don't want to hear this.   Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.   That's enough.  We shouldn't be doing this!  Isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the living room to pick up the PHONE.  We see her clearly now in bra and panties.   What?   What is it?   I don't understand?     It's your turn!   Throw it!  Carter is about to throw it in, when HE SEES AN OLDER COUPLE  Stairs!  Carter throws him the bomb, and Lee runs to the stairs --   Roof!   Wait!  There's people down there!   Get it out of here!   It's a bomb.  Isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a HUNDRED  We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.   Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.   Is this a payoff?   Five years ago?!  That's right before he left the force.  Lee and Carter exchange looks.    And Hu Li killed him for the plates.   We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.   She never even looked at you.   I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.    That's a good Twisting Tiger -- where did you learn that?  They switch to Chinese.   The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?   Baby Duck?   Do you still have the bills?   Are you okay?   She saved our lives.   Shhh, my head hurts.   Why did you help me?   I'm not used to having a partner.   Well we're not friends.   Fine with me.   See you in the next world.   Fine.   Yes.  We have heaven.   What's a Chinese heaven?   I think we should stop talking.   No.   Mind your own business.   There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.   No mu-shu.   No kung pao chicken.  Never.   Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.   Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?   Forget it.  It doesn't matter.  Lee turns away from Carter.   I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?   They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.   Did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world...and if you did, was she crying, crying...hey!   It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.   Who's Benjamin?   A Chinese man discovered electricity.   Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.   We're slowing down.  This must be it.   You've been a good friend, James Carter.   You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.    still holding on to the door frame -- swings and backflips onto the roof of the truck.   This way.  I see some lights.  Lee and Carter spot a tiny sliver of light coming through a MANHOLE COVER.  They start climbing up the metal stairs that lead up to the street.   Vegas...   Red Dragon.   Let's go.   What is Mac out?   Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.   I own the place.   Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.   Carter...here comes the rich white man.   Excuse me?  Isabella grabs him around the waist, pulls him close.   What's going on?   Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.   Just trying to make it look real.   Why don't you go get them?   How do I know I can trust you?   No.  But I'll help you.  Lee holds her for a long BEAT, their lips almost touching. He finally lets her go, and she disappears into the crowd. Carter walks up, sees Lee standing alone on the dance floor.   Dancing?   It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.  Lee motions to the room, where WE SEE a SECURITY GUARD standing in front of a small door.   No.  I'm going to find out.   Try to keep them busy for five minutes.    as he passes directly under the camera, clearly mouthing the words \"oh shit\" as he rolls by.  Lee looks to his left, sees the SOFT COUNT ROOM -- a mountain of COUNTERFEIT SUPERBILLS that are waiting to be paid out. On the opposite side, the REAL MONEY is being WHEELED OUT toward a waiting TRUCK that is parked at the back door.  Lee sees two more cameras in the ceiling, knows his cover is blown.  He jumps down off the cart, is standing in front of the locked vault.  There's no way to get the plates. Isabella has set him up again.  He turns and smiles at the confused SECURITY GUARDS.   Hi.  How's it going?  You guys have change for a twenty?  The GUARDS make their move.  And Lee starts to fight them down the hall, using the cart as a shield as he RAMS into TWO MORE GUARDS, fights them off as he turns the corner toward the casino door -- but he gets slammed to the ground by a right cross.  Hu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she stands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS.  She holds a knife to Lee's throat.      Bomb!!!  Hu Li HITS the TRIGGER just as it lands on a roulette table.   I did!   Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!  A hand on Carter's arm.  THIS IS SERIOUS.   Ricky Tan is alive.   We have to get to the Penthouse.  Lee jumps up, SPRINTS toward the elevators at the dragon end of the casino.   Carter...   Are you okay?   I didn't know which side you were on.   Put the plates down.  Ricky Tan looks down at the gun in Reign's belt.   Put the plates down.  It's over.   If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.   It's worth it to me.   I can't believe I flew ten-thousand miles for this shit!!  They lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES.  The sign dips and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE  No problem.  Lee and Carter look up to see the VERSACE SALESMAN and FOUR OF HIS FRIENDS sitting in the back of the limo staring at them.  The BOYS are all drinking champagne and dressed for a night on the town.   She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.  Lee and Carter watch as she gets on the plane.   Yes.   I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.   Carter, wait.  There's something I want you to have.  Lee pulls a BADGE from his pocket.  Hands it to Carter.   It's okay.  I can finally let it go.  Carter takes the badge.  Smiles.   What is this?   No, Carter.  I can't take this.   This money is evidence.   I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.   First class.   A little Mu-shu.   Amen to that, brother.  As Lee and Carter start to walk away together, the MUSIC SWELLS.  \"WAR\" starts to PLAY.  They dance their way through a crowd of people, their arms raised as the two friends make their way through the airport.",
        "Captain": "CAPTAIN DIEL sits behind his desk talking on the phone.   Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?   It's nine-thirty in the morning.   Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.   I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?   No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?",
        "Chin": "The following conversation is in Chinese, English subtitles.   Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.    We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.   This is still Hong Kong.   Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...    That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.    Lee walks in, sees Sterling sitting at Chin's desk.  Chin stands in the back.   Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.     Are you okay, Lee?  Beat.     Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...   Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.   I'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to fully cooperate with the Secret Service.  Lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment.  Chin motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to approach.    Escort Detective Carter to the airport --    Carter's Vette pulls up in front of a hole in the wall.",
        "Receptionist": "",
        "Steven": "Who's your friend?    I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.   A thousand years ago, a small, wealthy village in China hired a young Dragon to guard their treasure in a cave, hoping to scare off potential bandits.  Their plan worked quite well, until the people of the village started sneaking the Dragon extra food -- hoping to make him bigger and stronger.  The Dragon ate so much and grew so big -- that he eventually got stuck inside the cave -- and the treasure was stuck behind him for all eternity.  Ladies and gentlemen, I have found that lost treasure.  It is here, inside the greatest casino in the world!  Welcome to the Red Dragon, where everybody is a winner!  Reign smiles, flips a switch -- the CASINO COMES TO LIFE. Fireworks, bright lights, endless rows of tables, dealers waiting.  A BAND PLAYS on a stage in the casino lounge.  Chinese ACROBATS perform suspended from the ceiling and on the balconies above.  Applause all around as the FLAME shoots out of the dragon's nostrils and the acrobats perform.  Carter and Lee walk down the red carpet.   Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.   Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?   You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.  Reign walks off with his men.  Carter watches him leave.   I'm cutting our deal short.  I'm leaving.   They stay with me.  I'm sure you won't have a problem with that.  Reign shows Tan the gun in his belt.  Grabs the bag and starts to walk toward the door.   Greed will imprison us all.  Tan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife.",
        "Reign": "Who's your friend?    I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.      Traveling up the side of the Reign Hotel.  Stopping at the penthouse floor - where we see ISABELLA talking with Steven Reign in a hotel room.  After a BEAT, Reign walks to the door.  Carter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching.    Isabella closes the door.  She BRINGS THE BOMB WITH HER as she walks into the bedroom --    Carter and Lee run across the street, heading towards the entrance of the hotel.    Lee and Carter sprint out the Penthouse Elevators, running down the hallway.    Isabella takes her robe off, glances at the package, picks it up and starts to open it as Lee and Carter come BURSTING THROUGH the BEDROOM DOOR.    Lee and Carter run out the suite - Lee throwing the BOMB toward the END OF THE HALL as he and Carter dive to the floor.  Nothing happens.  Lee looks up, SEES a HOTEL EMPLOYEE pushing a room service CART, about to walk right past the package --    Lee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible. He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets are filled with PEOPLE AND CARS.    Lee and Carter, both wearing dark sunglasses, walk through the street trying their best to look like Secret Service Agents.  They approach Carter's parked VETTE.    Establishing.  Carter and Lee park their car and walk inside.    Carter and Lee enter.    Carter and Lee burst out the door at the bottom of the stairway -- coming almost face to face with --   A thousand years ago, a small, wealthy village in China hired a young Dragon to guard their treasure in a cave, hoping to scare off potential bandits.  Their plan worked quite well, until the people of the village started sneaking the Dragon extra food -- hoping to make him bigger and stronger.  The Dragon ate so much and grew so big -- that he eventually got stuck inside the cave -- and the treasure was stuck behind him for all eternity.  Ladies and gentlemen, I have found that lost treasure.  It is here, inside the greatest casino in the world!  Welcome to the Red Dragon, where everybody is a winner!

They were undercover U.S. customs agents trying to break a Triad smuggling ring. We don't know what they're transporting out of Hong Kong, but whatever it is, it got the agents killed.   Stay the hell out of our way.   We know all about Tan.  That's why we're leaving him out there as bait.  We think this is a lot bigger than just Ricky Tan and his Fu-Cang-Long Triads.   Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.

        "Club": "Carter follows Lee out of the car, the two men making their way to the door of the Raven Club.  Carter is combing his hair, getting himself ready for a night on the town, stopping when he spots two hot WOMEN walking into the club.    A dark, upscale club that is packed with GANGSTERS, BEAUTIFUL GIRLS and CIVILIANS.  Lee and Carter walk in.  Lee is trying to keep a low profile as Carter stares up at the stage, where a man sings Karaoke -- the most painful rendition of Michael Jackson's \"DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH.\"    Lee makes his way down a hallway -- looks through an open door - sees a private room.  Several TRIADS are using hi-tech MACHINES to count stacks of AMERICAN HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.    A room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open, watching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael Jackson, singing his heart out.  Dancing and making eyes at a few of the smitten women who are watching him.    Lee and Carter run into the street, just in time to see HU LI and several gangsters round a corner.",
        "Hostess": "Good afternoon, gentlemen.  Lee bows, followed by Carter.   Oh, you American?   You bring American money?   You get massage from Chinese girl before?   You pick any girl for you and your friend.  Carter looks like a kid in a candy store.   Oh yes, she's very nice.    Your friend have big appetite. (handing ROBES to Lee and  Carter Please put these on and wait upstairs in the quiet room.",
        "Carter": "Deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu.  The HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who is driving and singing to his radio.   I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.   Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.   All I did was invite them for a drink.   (checking Chinese-English  dictionary I said that?  Which word was \"goat?\"  Lee picks up his CD case.   Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.   Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!  Carter flips through the dictionary.  A CALL COMES in over  What was that?  Did you just pick up a case?  Did we just take another damn case on my vacation?  Lee smiles at Carter.   Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.   That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?   You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.  Carter looks at Lee.  Fixes his collar.   Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?   Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.  Carter dances through the door, Lee follows.   Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?   How you boys doing tonight?  The thugs ignore Carter as he motions to the stage, where the OLD MAN continues to sing.   That is the worst singing I've ever heard.  That sounds like something you'd hear in prison after lights out.  The thugs continue to ignore Carter.   Get closer to my body now.  And just love me, till you don't know how...  Lee steps back into shadow -- does a double take as he realizes he's hearing Carter belting out \"DON'T STOP 'TILL  Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!  Carter resumes singing, really getting down.  Moonwalking to the EDGE of the STATE where Lee PULLS HIM OFF.   I knew you were lying.   Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.   Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?   Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.   You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.  Before Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun. Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and fires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar.    Deng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang lui.  Nobody moves.  Strange looks from the crowd.  Carter turns to Lee.    What'd I say?   Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.  Reluctantly, Lee gets on stage.  More looks from the Chinese as Carter speaks, Lee translating.   Okay, all the Triads and ugly women go to that side, all fine ass women on this side.  Nobody moves.  Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling.   Let's try this again.  Who here knows Ricky Tan, raise your hand.  Nobody moves.   Who here is named Lee?  Raise your hand.  Nobody moves.   Now I know you're lying.  The crowd still hasn't moved.  Except in the back, where Lee spots several GANGSTERS leaving.  As Lee runs off stage --    I come back and catch y'all singing Michael Jackson and you're all going to jail.   Stop!  LAPD!  Lee takes off and chases them on foot.   Hang on, Lee.  I'm coming.  Carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding.  NOT EVEN CLOSE.  He backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!  ABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS.  They all tear off the LENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off.  The clatter of wood against wood as they beat at each other.  Wrestling over his pole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge.  BELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY to pull himself up.  Just as he gets his chin above the bar... snap!  It BREAKS and he drops.  Then...  WHAM!  WHAM!  The two gangsters CRASH LAND ON EITHER side of CARTER.  HE takes one look at their pain.   Forget this...  He dashes into the stairwell.  ABOVE, the last two GANGSTERS come at Lee.  He stomps down, levering up floor boards, which SEE-SAWS them off-balance.  With the advantage, he BATTERS them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off.  He climbs after the GANGSTER LEADER.  ON HU LI and the GANGSTERS  Coming over the crest of the hill, seeing Carter climbing up the hill.    Freeze!  Nobody move!  Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below. Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li.  She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel and WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THE   holding on with all their strength.  The bamboo is starting to bend.   All I wanted was a little mu-shu.   I can't believe I flew ten-thousand miles for this shit.  The POLE BREAKS   You lied to me.   You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.   So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew up the Embassy?   I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.   I was watching you kids.  My name is Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree black belt.  At least that's what I tell the girls at the Holiday Health Spa where I work out.  Carter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no reaction.   Let me give you kids some tips.  The key to Kung Fu is the follow through.  Why don't you stand up.  THE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction.  Carter continues to throw punches.   Go ahead, kick me, hit me.  I'll show you how to block.  Come on, stand up, give me your best shot -- try to kick right to my head.  The kids still don't move.  Carter, working up a sweat from shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.  He swings back around to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him flying back onto the mat.  He looks around and sees ALL of the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION.   That's pretty good.  Which one of you kids did that?   And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!   I am a tourist.   How you doin'?   That's right.    Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.  The Hostess takes Carter by the arm, walks over to a HIDDEN SLIDING DOOR - slides it open to reveal TWENTY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.  Carter truly is in Heaven.   No.  It's my first time.   Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.   She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.  Lee elbows Carter.   She said I could pick any girl I want.   Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.   Now I'm on vacation.  I knew you'd come through, Lee.  LEE doesn't respond.  LEE IS STARING AT SOMEONE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM.  A man who radiates a unique blend of sophistication and brutality.   What's wrong?   That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.   I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.   Ricky Tan, I've been looking all over for you.  Get up.  Tan looks up for a moment, a smile.   I said get on your feet!   I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!  Tan laughs, goes back to his laptop.  CARTER GRABS THE LAPTOP from Ricky and throws it across the room - SHATTERING IT against the wall.  Ricky glances at his men who are seated around the room waiting to move.   I told you to get on your feet!  Having heard the commotion, Lee arrives by Carter's side, breathless, as Tan looks up, surprised.   Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.   I'd like to pay you for that laptop.   That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.  Tan bows to Lee and Carter.    Damn!  No wonder you're pissed off.  Carter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of the men's punches.  In the middle of fighting, Lee is suddenly exposed -- he flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind. Momentarily stunned, he's lifted from behind -- two men throwing him out the front door.  Carter is also overpowered by two men, who lift him over their shoulders.   Goddamn you got a small ass.   Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.   Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.   My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!   You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?   Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?   And you ain't black!  The two men look at each other for a long BEAT.  Lee quickly walks out, slamming the door behind him, leaving Carter half dressed.   Captain, you're gonna have to speak up. I'm on a car phone!   Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?   Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.   Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.   Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.   Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!  As Carter walks out the DOOR, he brushes past HU LI, who is standing in the hallway disguised as a FED EX DELIVERY PERSON.  Carter checks her out as he exits.   How you doing?  Can you direct me to the Heaven on Earth massage parlor?  The OLD WOMAN stares at Carter, starts motioning to her CAGES filled with birds.   No, I don't eat live birds.  I like my birds dead and deep fried.  You ever been to Popeyes?  The Woman takes out a bird, holds up a HATCHET.   No, don't do that, I had a big lunch. I'm warning you, I'm a police officer -- just put the blade down and let the bird go.   How you doing?  I'm looking for Heaven on Earth.  The man stares at Carter, watches as he pulls out his:   Shan-shui cao guo-jiu, pao gai niu tao zi.   No man, I was just asking...   I'm gonna solve this case myself.  Taxi!  Carter flags down a CAB, jumps in the back seat.    Follow that limo.  The Cab Driver continues to stare at Carter.   You understand what I'm saying?  Follow that car!  Where it goes, you go!  This is a chase -- we are chasing that limo!  We are still parked -- we're not moving! This is the opposite of chasing -- drive the car or I will kill you!  The driver slowly turns, holding out his hand.  Carter fishes in his pocket hands the cab driver a wad of cash.   Stay here.  I'll be right back.  You understand?   I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.   I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.  As Carter walks past the doorman --   Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?   Help?  I'm not the help, man -- I'm the star.  That's my band up there -- I control the mood, the groove, the atmosphere.  Carter cuts a smoking DANCE MOVE.   Can you do that?  That's why you're down here and I'm up there.  Now this is my party -- don't forget it!  Carter walks onto the ship, starts singing to himself.   How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.    San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.   I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.   That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.   I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.   Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.   Red Dragon?  You sure about that?   Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.   Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?   Yeah.  Tell us!  And don't play games or we'll kick your lying ass!  Lee slowly turns around and looks at Carter, who is standing right behind him.   Who died?   Detective Yu?  Never met him.   Who?   Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.   I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.   What, leave you alone so he can cap you?   Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.    What the hell is going on here?  No answer.  Carter holds Lee's glance for a beat, then turns and walks the other way.   All right, get your hands up.  Hu Li backflips up -- kicking Carter in the head.   You wanna piece of me?  C'mon, I'll give you a little LAPD ass kickin'.  Hu Li savages Carter with a series of punishing blows.   What \"revenge\" is he talking about?   Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --   Fine with me.  Sterling walks away disgusted.   Hell no.  The Hong Kong police officers produce HANDCUFFS.  Beat.    Fine.  But don't expect me to talk to you.  Carter stalks off.   What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?   Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.   I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.   You're not very good at this, are you?   Forget it.  A long beat while Lee considers what to say.   Ask me if I give a shit.  Lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell.   How the hell did Tan get away with it?    This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?  Lee's caught, fibs badly.   You thought the \"Customs Agents get blown up\" and \"smuggling\" and \"Ricky Tan\" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...    So are you getting on the plane or not?!   Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.   It sounds impossible --   -- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.  Carter turns, walks away without looking back.   You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.    I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.   Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.   Almost, but you've got to say \"Rich White Man\" all run together like it's one word.   Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.   Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.   Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like \"Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!   Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.   Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.   The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.   Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?   He'll be back soon.   Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.  Lee lowers the binoculars, turns to Carter, who is trying to sleep on the bed.   Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.   You pull a muscle or something?   I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?   Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.   Excuse me?   Lee, maybe it's best if we don't discuss our personal lives.  Let's die curious.  LEE LIFTS THE BINOCULARS - turns back to the building.   What's she doing?   Lee?  You okay?  Lee's eyes go wide as Isabella drops her coat and starts to unbutton her blouse.   Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.   What did you say?   Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.   What's going on?  Lee stares at Carter, looks dazed.   Gimme the binoculars.   Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.  Lee hands Carter the binoculars, then turns his back as Carter watches to the window.   Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...   Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.   She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.  Lee steps in front of Carter, blocking his view.   This is our job.  We took an oath as police officers.  If we don't do this, who will?  Firemen?  Lee backs off, and Carter steps back to the window.  He sees Isabella hang up the phone.   Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?   She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.   No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...   She's walking back towards the door.   She opened the door.  Someone is delivering a package.   Lee...it's the girl who delivered the package to your office.  It's a bomb!  Lee and Carter bolt on the move - sprinting out of the room.    Damn girl, you fine.  Lee lowers his eyes as Isabella looks at him, grabbing the BOMB, Carter following him as they sprint out the bedroom.   Pick it up!   I don't need a turn!  Carter picks it up, starts running with it through the hall, heading for the elevator.   Get the hell away from here!  Carter is still holding the bomb, doesn't know what to do with it --   Get out of the building!  Lee looks horrified as he hangs onto the package, has no choice but to throw it back to Carter.   There's people up here!   Take it!  Lee takes the bomb, quickly ROLLS IT across the roof -- Lee and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides to the center of the roof - COMING TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ISABELLA.  She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package.   I wouldn't do that!!!   Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.   How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.  Isabella opens her bathrobe -- WE SEE a small BADGE pinned to her bra.   Let me see it again?   Yeah, that's right.   So what's your story?   It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.   How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?   What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?   Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.   They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.   You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.   Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.  Carter's had the last word, he gets into the Vette.  Lee reluctantly gets in, too.   Kenny!  How you doin'?  Kenny looks up at Carter.  A cool, appraising glance.   How's the action tonight?  The house making out okay?  Kenny follows as Carter opens a door to --    This is where I say I'm LAPD in a loud voice, they all scream and run and shit. Watch.  It's real funny.  Kenny grabs Carter's shoulder, pulling him aside.   What??  Where'd you hear that?   And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.   Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.   I'd like to see you try.  Kenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial arts move.  Lee gets in front of Carter to protect him -- countering Kenny's move.   I heard that.  Lee and Kenny laugh.   Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.   How'd you know?   So tell me what you know.   Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.  Kenny considers this for a moment.   What?   Lemme see 'em.  Kenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a WALL SAFE. He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill.  Carter checks it out.   All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.  Carter and Lee move for the door.    We're looking for a guy named Zing.  Is he here?  Zing hears Carter, turns and sees them.  Then RUNS.  Carter and Lee exchange looks and run after him.   I hope you just said I have no business being here, 'cos I was just leaving.  Carter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him, freezing him in his tracks.  Isabella slowly walks several feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks.   ...oh, that's a filling right there. That's gonna cost you.  Hu Li lunges forward and KICKS Carter, sending him backwards.   I should kill you right now, but I'm gonna let you live, 'cause you're fine, and maybe you can be reformed.  The WORKERS start towards Carter.  He holds up his hands.   No more hitting.  I'll get in the truck myself.  As Carter walks towards the truck by Hu Li, they exchange a look of sheer hatred.  As soon as he passes by her, Hu Li COLDCOCKS Carter with her gun.   What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.   For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.  Lee looks disappointed.   Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.   I'm about to be killed and you \"Shhh\" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.   It doesn't matter.  Lee thinks about this for a BEAT.   We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.   You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.   I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.   I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.   I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?   Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?   I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.   Fine by me.   You thinking about that girl that dumped you?   If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.   How was the sex?   You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?   What about a little king pao chicken?   Steamed dumplings?   That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.   Are you serious?   As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.   That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?   Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.  Lee clears his voice.   Very nice.   I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.  Carter opens the crate -- it's filled with SUPERBILLS, about $1,000,000 worth.  He tosses a stack to Lee.   Hello, Benjamin.   Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.   No Chinese man discovered electricity.   Now that I believe.  Carter pockets two stacks of superbills.  Lee looks at him.   You never know.  Besides, I always wanted to die rich.  The truck lurches.   End of the line.   Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.   Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.    who swings onto the ground -- grabbing one of the guards to use a shield as gunfire erupts.  Lee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the ground.  He then grabs the guard Carter is using as a shield and together THEY SWING him into the truck -- KNOCKING DOWN the first two guards.  Carter and Lee slam the back doors SHUT -- bolting them CLOSED and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like the closest way out:  A LARGE OPEN PIPE on the side of the tunnel.   Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.  They both turn around and come FACE TO FACE WITH:  A TEN-STORY DRAGON.  Fire shoots from its nostrils every 60  That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.  Lee and Carter watch as limos pull up to the front of the hotel -- it's like a HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE.  The richest of the rich are making their way inside.   Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.   Follow me my Asian brother.  Carter and Lee start to walk away.   Just stay down wind, because I think you stepped in some serious rat shit down there.   Black.  42-long.  Nothing touches this body but pure silk.  And get my partner something from the children's department.  Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.   Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.   This is the last time I go shopping with you.    Remember, Lee, you're a player now.  You own the place.  Carter pulls out his ALTOIDS, and he and Lee each take one as they walk through the doors.   That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.   Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.  They are moving through the MAIN ENTRY HALL lined with TERRA COTTA CHINESE SOLDIERS - posed and dressed for battle.  RICKSHAWS and BICYCLES take people through the hotel.  The MAIN CASINO is roped off and empty.  People crowded around the perimeter - a sign reads:    Bring us some twelve-year old scotch...  Get us a box of your finest cigars.  Give me ten dollars in nickels.   Look at this place, Lee.  The biggest front in the world.  As people pour into the casino, Steven Reign is making his way through the crowd, shaking hands and posing for pictures.   Wait here.  I'll handle this.  As Carter walks off, a WOMAN grabs Lee and pulls him onto the dance floor.   Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.   Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...   You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.   Lee, what the hell are you doing?   Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?   Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!   Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction.  Carter looks around the casino.   I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.   I'll give it my best shot.   I saw the sign, I can read.  Now gimme a hundred-thousand in chips.  And a Diet Coke and some wash-n-dries.  Let's move, people, I came to play.  The DEALER pushes 100K worth of CHIPS in front of Carter.   What the hell is that?   Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?   You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?    Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?  The PIT BOSS gets on his walkie-talkie.   Answer me one question.  How come Ben Vereen isn't performing here at the hotel?  Is Ben Vereen not good enough for you people?   Lionel Ritchie hasn't been black since the Commodores.   I have a dream, where black people and white people can gamble together without getting different chips!  A BIG CROWD has gathered as the Security Guards try and push their way through.  The pit boss picks up the phone, calls upstairs.   Sing with me!  \"We shall overcome!\"  Carter starts clapping, and the confused crowd joins in as the Security Guards move in.   Thank you.  Now in the spirit of brotherhood, let's play craps!   How much is that?   Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?  Carter turns to the MAN next to him, who wears a traditional AFRICAN ROBE and is standing with a giant blonde escort.   Here, your highness, have a hundred dollars.  The Viagra is on me tonight!   Don't say that, we're all royalty.  My great grandmammy was Queen Nephertit -- we probably cousins, man.  How much you got on the table?   Yeah, we definitely cousins now.  Who wants to blow on my hand for luck?  Carter turns to a BIG TEXAN who is standing with a GORGEOUS YOUNG GIRL who is falling out of her dress.   Hey, Marlboro man, you mind if your lady blows on my hand for luck?   Can I come over for Thanksgiving?  Come on, baby, give me some luck.  The GIRL blows on the dice, and Carter stares down at her.   Nice blowing.  When's your next birthday, I'll be the cake.   Don't threaten me.  I got friends in this town that will bite off your ears. Just sit tight, because I've got the dice and I am on fire!  Carter throws the dice.   Let it ride!   I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!  Several TRIAD SOLDIERS dressed like SECURITY GUARDS approach Carter's table.   That would be great.  Don't want any of these rich white people to jump me.  As they walk toward the door marked \"VIP ROOM\", Carter glances at the MEN, knows he's in deep shit.   Lee!!  The guards restrain him.   Lemme ask you something.  Any of you ever felt $500,000 before?  He SLAMS THE RACK OF CHIPS ACROSS THEIR FACES -- chips flying as the GUARDS hit the floor.   Doesn't feel so good, does it?   Black man gets on a hot streak and you're all trippin'?  Carter and Lee see each other.  They have the same simultaneous though:    Lee!   Check it out.  Catfight!  POW!  He socks a GUARD in the face.   What the HELL are you doing with tape on your face?  No time to explain -- two more security guards arrive.  Kicks and punches fly, but Lee CAN'T GET HIT IN THE MOUTH!  He bobs and weaves, holding his hands to Carter to untie them in between swings.  Suddenly:  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  GUNSHOTS from the Eye In The Sky Room.  Everyone HITS THE DECK.  Carter and Lee dive on to the floor as panic ripples through the Casino.  People FLEE for the  This can't be good.  Lee's eyes BUG - he sees it too, feet STAMPEDING past it!  A high heel misses it by a fraction of an inch.  He LUNGES for it, manages to CRADLE it in his taped hands when --  WHAM!  He is BUMPED and it FLIES AWAY.  The second it hits the floor, it is KICKED, skittering down the red carpet.  ABOVE...the victor emerges in the Eye in the Sky Room.  Hu Li STEPS OUT on the PAGODA ROOF and JUMPS DOWN.  The DETONATOR ROLLS right past Hu Li.  As she bends to PICK up the detonator, Lee knows he won't get there in time. Horrified, he SCREAMS at CARTER through the tape.  Hu Li lifts the detonator.  Carter finally pulls the TAPE OFF Lee's face.  Lee SPITS the grenade into the air.   Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?   No you didn't!   What?!?!   Hold on!  Carter stuffs his pockets with chips, then races after Lee. But halfway up the carpet.  Carter stops.  Lee turns to see what is holding him up.  Hu Li SURVIVED the blast and Carter has turned to face her.   You go after Ricky.  I got this.   Just GO!  Lee turns and runs off past the dragon.  Unfortunately, FIVE TRIADS block his path.  In a flurry of PUNCHES, Lee makes short work of them, and races toward the elevators.    Each readying in their own manner.  Hu Li carefully wraps her long hair into a bun on top of her head.  Carter stretches, flexes, ready to sting like a bee.   I'm not gonna hold you back this time just because you're a woman.  I'm gonna pretend you're a man.  She pulls off her jacket, prepares to fight him in her undershirt.   A very beautiful man with a perfect body who I'd like to take to the movies.  She takes a sword from a Terra Cotta statue, SWINGS IT AROUND like a master.   I may have been absent the day we went over this in karate class.  Quick, Carter reaches for a fighting stick off a Terra Cotta soldier.  WHOOSH!  She SLICES IT IN HALF.  Carter reaches for another.  SLICE!  She's toying with him.   Will you STOP?!?!  What am I supposed to fight you with?  No more toying.  Hu Li CHARGES Carter, who GRABS a ROULETTE WHEEL as a MAKESHIFT SHIELD.  She SLICES it in HALF!  He's got nowhere to hide.  She JABS him with the sword.  Carter SCREAMS.  Falls back against the table, clutching his chest.  Hu Li WINDMILLS, kicking a Terra Cotta soldier on top of Carter, but --   When are you people gonna learn?  Don't mess with the brothas!  WEAK in the KNEES, Carter looks to the SOUND ON HIS CHEST. He reaches through the slice in his jacket.  Instead of a hand covered in blood, it comes out with a THICK WAD OF CASH!   Thank you, Benjamin!  Carter runs for the elevator.   Hey, Ricky, how's it going man?  What's up, Lee?  Lee has the gun pressed to Tan's head.  We've never seen him like this before.   Lee, you okay?  Lee doesn't respond.  He keeps an eye on Ricky.   Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.   C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.  Lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.   I don't know about you, but I need a wine cooler.  As they turn to the door -- Hu Li is walking toward them, bleeding and half-dead.  She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND. This one twice the size of the one from earlier.   Please tell me she just asked for a ride to the airport.  Hu Li hits the switch - starts to smile.  Lee and Carter turn and RUN for the OPEN WINDOW.   We made it, man.   I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.   That your gate down there?   I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.   You take care of yourself, Lee.  Carter steps back, BOWS TO LEE.  Lee SHAKES CARTER'S HAND like a brother.  The two men smile.  Turn to walk away.   Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.   In that case, I got something for you. I picked it up at the hotel.  Carter pulls out a WAD OF CASH.   About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.   It's okay, I got lots more.  Carter pulls out another wad of cash.   They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.   Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.  Lee looks back toward Isabella.   New York City?   The Plaza Hotel?   Some Kung-Pao?  They look at each other, smile.   I could use a little vacation.",

        "Isabella": "Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.    I don't think so.   This is your ship?   El Capitan?   Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?   The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was \"Red Dragon.\"   I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.   Somebody who got on the wrong yacht.   Enjoy the party, Mr. Carter.  Carter nods, waves.  Steven Reign and Isabella walk away. Carter's watching.    She walks to the bedroom, where we see her through SHEER CURTAINS.  Slowly taking off her coat.    As she turns to the window.  A TAPE RECORDER in hand.  She puts the recording device away, walks back into the bedroom and puts on a robe.   Get on your feet.  Lee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella begins to open the package.   You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.   I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.   I know who you are, Inspector Lee.   We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.      Look, I've been working this case for months now...   They think I'm a crooked customs agent.  Lee examines the stack of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS from Hu Li's package.  Carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the food from the mini fridge.   No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?   It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.   In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.   It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.   Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.  Isabella lights a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL on fire, and it burns  They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.   The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.  Isabella thinks for a beat.   Maybe that's where you can help us. Carter, this is your city, right?  Carter nods.   And Lee, you know Hu Li and the Triads?  Lee nods.   Okay, find out where Hu Li's keeping the plates. (hands Lee a card with a phone  number Welcome aboard, gentlemen.  From this moment on, you're working for the United States Secret Service.  Isabella opens the door to let Lee and Carter out.  They exit quickly, trying to hide their excitement.  CAMERA STAYS on Isabella as she takes out her CELL PHONE, punches in a number.   Lee and Carter are officially out of the Secret Service's way...   Hu Li, I think there's someone who will want to talk to them first.  Hu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement.  BANG!  Lee falls.  Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt of her gun.  BANG!  Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li POUNDS him across the jaw with her fist.   Put your arms around me.   Hold me close.  There's cameras everywhere.  An ASIAN BAND sings STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT as Lee tries his best to slow dance.  An intimate moment between Isabella and Lee, her face nestled in the crook of his neck, hiding her face.   I need your help.   I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.  Lee starts to get into the music, moving his hips in a slow, sensual rhythm.   You move well.   Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.  Lee looks over her shoulder.   Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.   If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.    The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.   Dip me!  Lee dips her, holds her in his arms for a long BEAT.   I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?   It's time to end this, Inspector.  Isabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator from Hu Li's hand -- slamming her against the wall and sticking the gun under her chin.   Don't move!  United States Secret Service.  Hu Li WHIPS her KNIFE around, catches Isabella across the hand -- the GUN SLIDING across the room near the detonator -- the TWO WOMEN fight around it.  Lee watches them almost step on it - dives to the floor and rolls toward the detonator.  He's about to grab it when:   I'm fine.  She steps in, too weak and starts to fall.  Lee grabs her and holds her in his arms.  HE gently helps her down.   Now you know.  DING!  The elevator doors open.  Isabella holds up a ROOM KEY - the key to the SUITE.  Lee takes the key, backs away and steps into the elevator.   I'll try to get backup.  Be careful.  The elevator doors close.",
