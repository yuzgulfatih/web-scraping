What?!           Get some perspective, Lowell.  No, you do not.  You're not listening. Really know what you're going to do before you do it.",

If you violate the Kentucky order, when you step foot back in Kentucky, they can find you in contempt and they can incarcerate you. And you ought to know that.  Okay, Jeff, I'm going to sit you down at that table over there.  I'm going to start as fast as possible.  I don't want to give them a chance to get another restraining order, okay?  Let's go.  You understand, Dr. Wigand, you are under oath.  This is a sworn deposition. There's no judge.  It's not a trial. Will you state your name for the record.  In other words, it acts as a drug?  It acts as a drug on the body?  It acts as a...  There an echo in here?  Your objection's been recorded.  She typed it into her little machine over there.  It's on the record.  So now I'll proceed with my deposition of <u>my</u> witness.  Does it act as a drug?     Thank you, Doctor.  Thank you.",

There was this whole <u>line</u> of people...whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.  And that's what cigarettes are for...?  A delivery device for nicotine.  Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...  You're saying that Brown &amp; Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...  And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?  In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown &amp; Williamson with ignoring health considerations <u>consciously</u>...  And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown &amp; Williamson had you fired.  And the reason he gave you?  And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?  Good.

People burning up from falling asleep smoking. I received a shitload of scientific papers from inside Philip Morris... Anonymous.  You or anybody in FDA know someone who can translate this stuff into English for me?  Mr. Wigand, please.  Thank you, Bob.  My name's Lowell Bergman...  I'm --  No, Bergman...B.E.R.G.M.A.N....  I'm a producer with \"60 Minutes\"...  Yeah.  Yes.  How does he know he doesn't want to talk to me?  He doesn't know what I'm calling him about...          If you're curious to meet me...    Have you always lived in Louisville?     Thank you.      Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.  I still do the tough stories.  \"60 Minutes\" reaches a lot of people.  Far as you go where?  Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do...but I don't take that seriously. Where do you work?    That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs.  But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.  If you want to do it.    Yeah.  Debbie...  Oh, Bill...  Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch.  You want it for the Evening News?  I'm gonna do a follow-up.  Catch ya' later.  Debbie...      Who is this?  What are you talking about?  Where are you?  Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?  I'm Lowell Bergman.  We spoke on the phone, remember?  C'mere.  I want to talk to you.    To straighten something out with you. Right here.  Right now.  Why am I gonna mention your name?  How the hell do I know about Brown &amp; Williamson?  And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist.  Think.  Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information <u>before</u> they provided me with it?  No.  I did not.  Big Tobacco is a big story.  And you got something important to say.  I can tell. But, yes.  I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, <u>fuck</u> your story, I don't burn people.  They're afraid of you, aren't they?  (after a beat, trying to make  Like where'd you work before Brown &amp; Williamson?  I don't know...you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi-finals?  Just give me an example...  Seven dwarfs?  ...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...  Okay, so, here you are...you go to work for tobacco. You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values.  You go to tobacco...  Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume.  Go to a lot of golf tournaments.  The hell with everything else. What are you doing?  Why are you working for \"tobacco\" in the first place?  Nothing's wrong with that.  That's it; you're making money...you're providing for your family?  What could be wrong with that?  Then...you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.  Because, look, here's how it lays out: if you got vital, insider stuff the American people for their welfare really <u>do</u> need to know...and you feel impelled to disclose it and violate your agreement in doing so, that's one thing.  On the other hand, if you want to honor this agreement, then that's simple.  You do so.  You say nothing.  You do nothing. There's only one guy who can figure that out for you.  And that's you.  All by yourself.  He referred to this...the Seven Dwarfs...  The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this...  Said they <u>should</u> be afraid of him...  I assume, afraid of what he could reveal. Now, you tell me.  What does this guy have to say that threatens these people?  Hardly new news.  What's this?  Why not?  That's not good enough.  This guy is the top scientist in the number three tobacco company in America.  He's a corporate officer.  You <u>never</u> get whistle-blowers from Fortune 500 companies.  This guy is the ultimate insider.  He's got something to say; he wants to say it; I want it on \"60 Minutes.\"  Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...  We got a guy...who wants to talk but he's constrained. What if he were \"compelled\"?    What do you mean, what's it do?  Because he has to reveal it in a court of law.  It's on record, it's out.  It's no secret anymore.  So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate?  It's out in the world...  I don't think he's got any attorneys.  What do you say, Mike?  What do you think?          No.  No, it's okay...  How's - how's the new place?      You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway. How are your kids handling the new house?  We have a couple.  One's hers, one's mine.  Everybody uses a different name. Modern marriage. How's Liane?  What do you mean followed you?  Did you call the police?  Well, what do you <u>really</u> think, though?     Jeffrey, describe for me in detail what happened.  You called me.      It's obvious, isn't it?  Hello.  You there  It's okay.  What did you get us?  Marcuse.  Yeah.  He was my mentor.  He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s...and on me, personally.  My father?  What the hell's that got to do with my father?  You charge by the hour?  Well, my father left us when I was five- years old.  He was <u>not</u> the most ingenious man I ever knew...  Let's get back to Brown &amp; Williamson.  If you decide to go on \"60 Minutes,\" I got to know everything about why you got fired.  They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you.  I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?  <u>I'm</u> not pushing you around! I'm asking you questions.     You go public and thirty-million people hear what you got to say, nothing, I mean nothing, will ever be the same again.  You believe that?  You should.  Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend.  And that's the power you have.  I believe that?  Yes, I believe that.  Yes.  Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?!  I never abandoned a source!    Words!  While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out <u>in the world</u>, giving my word and backing it up with action.  Now, are you going to go do this thing, or not?  The stringer was supposed to be shooting B-roll on street cops in New Orleans. What's with all the horses?    What was he seeing?  Hello, I'm Lowell Bergman.  Yes, I'm right here.  Could you call me back on a hard line?  Area code 212-555-0199.    ...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?    Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.  Yeah, and he's going to need legal representation.  Well, actually, no.  Well, he's on the fence.  That's the point.  Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him?  How do you want to do it?  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  Shit...  (contemplating phone; to Debbie  Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?  Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!  What happened?  Was it gang related?    What are you talking about?  Jeff, call the FBI right away...  Jeff...    Good.  But Jeff...      You're getting my drift?  So, is everything okay?  Do you think we could talk about the taping?  Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...     Oh, man.    It's okay, Jeff.    ...they \"volunteered.\"  A friend owns a large security company.  I heard.  I know.  I'm going to go there tonight...  Yeah. Want to play that game we were playing before?  You know, I think you got it up to five.  I was ahead of you.  <u>You</u> attract a crowd.  I heard about the Kentucky gag order...  Maybe things have changed...    No, I don't have a clue.  Run that Sandefur piece on \"nicotine's not addictive.\"  Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with \"I believe they perjured...\"  Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath.  Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word \"felt\" on the B-side...    Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of \"Kools\" to the world. \"Sealed\" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.  When's the air date?  Tell her I'll call her back in ten.  I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time.  This is a news organization.  People are always telling us things they shouldn't.  We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest...  And if it is, we air it.  What does that mean?  \"Rife with -- ?\"  No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...      Come again?  Is this \"Alice in Wonderland\"?  Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?  \"Tortious interference\"?  Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.    What now?  So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?  I'm not touching my film...  No, I'm not...  Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on \"60 Minutes\"?    I discovered this.  SEC filing... For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.  It's not a rumor.  It's a sale. If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown &amp; Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?      Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money.  They work for free.  And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.  No, I'm questioning your hearing!  You hear \"reasonable\" and \"tortious interference.\"  I hear...  \"Potential Brown &amp; Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse.\"  I hear...  \"Shut the segment down.  Cut Wigand loose.  Obey orders.  And fuck off...!\"  That's what I hear.  I am?  You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out.  To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do.  I deliver him.  He sits.  He talks.  He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement.  And he's only the key witness in the <u>biggest</u> public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history.  And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth?  Yes. Is it newsworthy?  Yes.  Are we gonna air it?  Of course not.  Why?  Because he's not telling the truth?  No.  Because he <u>is</u> telling the truth.  That's why we're not going to air it.  And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!  C'mon, what are you?  And are you a businessman?  Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...    These people are putting <u>our whole reason</u> for <u>doing what we do</u>...on the line!  What?      They're killing the Wigand interview...  They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.  I'm alone on this...    Jeffrey...  Jeffrey, how are you?  How's the family, okay?  What do you mean there is no family?            B &amp; W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block... But you, I mean, I know how...  No?  No, what?  Jeff...     Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest?  I'm not going to do that.  No.  I'm <u>not</u> going to take \"no\" for an answer.  No.  I'm staying right here.  Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air.  You don't like it?  Hey, I'll tell you what...<u>fire</u> my ass...  Get me Wigand.  ...fuck is this?  Fuck!          Oh, my God.  Jeff!  Wake the fuck up!  Everybody is on the line here.  If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush.  Do you understand? Everything you say!  <u>Everything</u>...you...<u>say</u>!  And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back!  Because you keep from me...what they can discover.  And they <u>will</u> discover everything!  Believe me.      Yes.  Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?  Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview...where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?  Alright...the ABC Telemarketing Company?  ABC Telemarketing Company.  That's the <u>whole</u> point, Jeffrey.  That's the whole point.  Anyone's.  Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made.  They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man.  Don't you understand?  That's not the point.  That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not!  Hello...?       Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?  We gotta hook up.  P.J.'s.  Yeah, I got it.  500 pages of it.  They looked in every corner of this guy's life...from a spousal abuse charge, to shoplifting, to a traffic ticket he got once for running a red light.  It's Terry Lenzner's outfit, IGI.  Jack, listen to me.  Their strategy:  discredit this guy, ruin his reputation in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, and then nobody will ever listen to what he's got to say about tobacco. He's dead.  Unless I can get this thing knocked down.  To make it even a little more attractive, I don't know if you're ever gonna get paid.  That's a good question.  \"Is there any truth to any of it?\"  I doubt it.  Soon.  That's great, Jack.  How are you, Jim?  Really?  Hi, Joan.  Catch you later.  When's your deadline?  Push it.  It's a smear campaign, Charlie.    And it's bullshit.  And if I'm right, are you going to put the <i>Journal</i>'s reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?  Yeah.  Catch you later.  What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm editing.  No.  I <u>should</u> have.  I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you.  I'm not gonna shut up for you.  Not on any of it.     I've been banished.  In lieu of being fired.  I don't know.  How does that get Wigand on the air?  Here.  These are their leads, their sources.  I want you to have your reporters...  Have them make their <u>own</u> calls.  They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier... Push the deadline, Charlie...  Yeah.         Alright.  Get me the manager's office...  Mr. MacDougal, my name is Lowell Bergman. I'm a producer for \"60 Minutes\"... I'm concerned with a friend of mine who's staying at your hotel right now.  No, no.  Don't call the police! Just tell him I'm on the phone with you...  My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.  Did he hear you?  What about now?  Hello, can you hear me now?    (on the cell phone, shouts,  No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!  That's bullshit, Jeff!  I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes.  I helped him to say yes. Alright.  You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all.  You got a mind of your own, don't you?       I'm running out of heroes, man... Guys like you are in short supply.  I'm on a leave of absence.  Forced vacation.    \"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'\"  You know, you take the \"60 Minutes\" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call.  Maybe Wigand's right.  Maybe I'm hooked.  What am I hooked on?  The rush?  \"60 Minutes\"? What the hell for?  Infotainment.  It's so fucking useless, all of it.  Free press?  Press is free...for anyone who owns one.  Larry Tisch has a free press.  I got perspective.  From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.  Patch him through.  Oh, good...  Yeah, I'm here.      Hi.  So, what are you folks doing here in Lincoln?      Just ran into two of your \"geologists.\" Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?  So, I'll hold it...  And...  How long?  You got a deal.     Jim, it's Lowell.      How prominent?  What kind of placement?  Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know...they will not air an interview.  Debbie.  It's me...  Oh, it's late.  I can't get out of here til mid-morning. I'll be in tomorrow night... Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...  Lowell.  Here's how it works.  You ask me questions.  I tell you if you're <u>wrong</u>.  Yeah?  Why?  You ready...?  Did I tell you you were wrong?  No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.  Oh, lots.  But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind?  Lost his heart?  Walked out on us?  Not one fucking time!  You want to know why?  I'm going to <u>tell</u> you why.  Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.  Oh, please, Mike...  No, <u>you</u> give <u>me</u> a break!  I never left a source hung out to dry, ever.  Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now!  When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game!  Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike.  What the hell did you expect?  You expect me to lie down?  Back off?  What, get over it?  Like what?  Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?  Mike...in my...  Yeah.  Good.                 Yeah? What did I win?    I quit, Mike.  I did?  What do I tell a source on the next tough story?  Hang in with us. You'll be fine...maybe?  What got broken here...doesn't go back together again.  So, uh...  <i>FRONTLINE</i> AND IS ON THE FACULTY OF THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF",

Breathe deep.  Slow down, honey.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Here we go.  Deep breaths, deep breaths.  Pooh's dusty, sweetheart...he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay?  So what's - what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs \"don't breathe any more of that dust in.\" ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches.  And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack.  And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh?  Okay?  You're better already, aren't you?  Okay, baby?     I can take her.    Instant rice...?  Try the car.     I'm going to the store.  You need anything?  Soy sauce...                        Mr. Bergman?  What did you want me to consult about?    Black, black...  Look, I really don't have that much time...  Like what?  Your sign?  I know what I have to know.      ...this is a Fire-Safety Product Study for Philip Morris.

(meaning Philip Morris  Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?  Did work.    Should I just take the documents now?  I worked as the head of Research and Development for Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Company.  I was a Corporate Vice President.  Mr. Bergman...    I'd rather play than talk about it. What did you want to see me about?  I don't like being back here.  Chapter and verse.      \"Research...\" You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...       <u>Dr</u>. Wigand.  So, what you are saying is:  it isn't enough that you fired me.  For no good reason!  Now you question my integrity? On top of the humiliation of being fired? You threaten me?!  You threaten my family?! It never crossed my mind not to honor my agreement... But I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur, and Brown &amp; Williamson, too...  Fuck me? Well, fuck you!!  ...you fucked me!    Fuck you, too!     (motioning with the club,     Good.  I want to talk to you.      So, you didn't mention my name?  You haven't talked to anybody about me?  How did Brown &amp; Williamson know I spoke to you...?  It <u>happened</u> after I talked to you.  I do not like coincidences!         ...and my little girl has acute asthma... Deborah.  My eldest daughter.     And, I'm unemployed.  So I have to protect my medical coverage. ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.  They should be.          For example.  James Burke, the CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson...when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't <u>argue</u> with the FDA...  He didn't even <u>wait</u> for the FDA to tell him.  He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America.  Instantly.  And then he developed the safety cap...  Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right?  But he's also a man of science.  He's not going to allow his company...to put on the shelf...a product that might hurt people. Not like the Seven Dwarfs...  The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco...they got up in front of Congress that time...it was on television...  It was on C-SPAN.  Yeah.      I've always thought of myself...as a man of science.  That's what's wrong with it.  I've got to go pick up the girls.  They only had half a day...         That's it...  Hey, hey, hey, c'mon.  C'mon.  We can make this work for us.  Okay?  It's just...it's a smaller scale. Simpler...easier...more time.  More time together.  More time with the kids.  More time for us, okay?  It's just...  Can you imagine me coming home from some job feeling good at the end of the day?  This is gonna be better.  This is gonna be better.           Hey, baby.  What's wrong?  Did you see somebody or did you hear them?  Where?     Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?  Why don't you just sit up at the desk.  Get out some paper and draw me a picture, okay?  What are you gonna draw me, baby?  An animal, something like that?  You stay down here until Daddy gets back...alright, Barbara? You stay down here.               They're nocturnal.  You know what that means?  That means that they only come out at nighttime.       Is it too late?    The new place?  New.  Sure.    Good. You have kids?  She's okay.  Hold on a minute, Lowell... ...somebody...may be following me.  I don't know.  They came on the property...  I don't want to be paranoid...  I mean, maybe it's a game.  Some kind of mind game.  I don't know what the <u>fuck</u> I <u>really</u> think!  Are they doing it?  Is some crank doing it?  Are they doing it to make me <u>feel</u> paranoid?  Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know!  I don't fucking know.     Well, no, look...I mean, there was a footprint.  Forget it.  It's probably not important at all. You know, I got a job now.  I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry. So, what were you calling about?  No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow.  So, what about?  ...okay.  How'd you know that, Lowell?  Yeah...  Look, thanks for talking.  I'm sorry I woke you up.  Lowell...?  Who is this?  Do not call here!  Do not...  Tempura...  The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor...Marcus?  Next to your father?  Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?  My father was a mechanical engineer...most ingenious man I ever knew.  Why?       I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I?  I could be anything.  Right?  Anything worth putting on between commercials...    You believe <u>that</u>?  You believe that because you get information out to people...something happens?  Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job?  Having status?  And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism?  Something to do on a Sunday night.  And maybe it won't change a fucking thing.  And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up!  Broke, alone!  I don't think you really understand --  I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend!  And what are you puttin' up?  You're puttin' up words!                 They're terrorizing us.  Death threats?! To my <u>family</u>?  My kids?!  Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.  They do this with impunity!  They get to go home at night.  What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?!  My girls are crying, so fuck them!  I want to tape!  I'm done thinking about it.    I'll call them, Lowell.     Yes, I'm afraid I did.  A gun?  Yes.  What caliber is my gun?      I don't think it's unconstitutional <u>yet</u> to own a gun.  I'm a target shooter.  Yes, I do.  A .38 Target Master.  In my gun safe downstairs.  A .45 Gold Cup.  A .22 target pistol.  So what?  Yes.  Yes, I do. Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!  What's going on?        ...letters to my brother...my will.  That computer has everything...  I'm doing an interview.  ...to talk about it.  To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it.  But, I really - I didn't know how to do that...    Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown &amp; Williamson's representation, clearly <u>misstated</u>...what is common language within the company...we are in the nicotine delivery business.  A delivery device for nicotine.  You're gonna get your fix...    The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called \"coumarin.\"  When I came on board at B&amp;W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful.  I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business.  I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...  I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.  Most certainly.  Poor communication skills.  Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it.  There are times I feel compelled to do it.  If you asked me would I do it again?  Do I think it's worth it?  Yeah, I think it's worth it.  Hi.  My name is Jeff Wigand.  You can call me Mr. Wigand; you can call me Dr. Wigand--I have a Ph.D. in biochemistry and endocrinology; you can call me Jeff... Anything else you want to call me...you'll have to do so in private... Okay...  I find chemistry to be magical. I find it an adventure.  An exploration into the building blocks of our physical universe... So, how many of you have taken chemistry before?    Our first experiment is... ...going to be measuring the molecular weight of butane...  Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand.  Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...  When should we do this?        Who the hell are you?!  What are you doing in my house?!  Lowell, I can't afford --  I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...  I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation.  So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...  Did you have a good day?  Coffee, Lowell?     Where should I wash them?  What's the difference...        Can we talk about this when I get back?  I'm not free to testify...here...?  Jail?  How does one...\"go...to...jail?\"  What does my family do?  Go on welfare?  If my wife has to work?  Who's going to look after the kids?  Put food on the table? My children need me.  If I'm not teaching...there's no medical...no medical...even on co-pay, that's like... Tuition...    I don't know what to do.    What's changed?  No.  I mean since whenever...  Fuck it.  Let's go to court.  I do.    That is correct.             There is - there is no family.

        "Hewitt": "I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.  Corporate has some questions.  We've got a meeting at Black Rock first thing in the morning.  Interfering?  That's what we do.  Why?  You think we have liability? What's the CBS News' position, Eric?      Kluster's coming over.  It's an alternate version.  So what if we have an alternate version?  And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.  Yeah, I heard rumors.  Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?  CBS does not do that.  And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!  You're exaggerating!  You are a fanatic.  An anarchist.  You know that?

Don't you have to be at the office?    Do you want more rice?  How about you?  I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?  Uh, what are those boxes?  What do you need at the store?  Right now?  Why did you take your stuff from the office?    Why?  Who said?    No, thank you.  Jeffrey...!  Who's calling?

I'm going to have to go downstairs.  Debbie, Barbara...  Debbie!    I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the \"F\" up, they were going to kill you...           Please don't wash your hands in the sink.  Use the bathroom.  That's for food.  Leave it on!  Just leave it on, okay?!  I don't think I can do this...  I want to stand by my husband...

Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.  Yes, baby?"

    "description": "Balls-out 60 Minutes Producer Lowell Bergman sniffs a story when a former research biologist for Brown and Williamson, Jeff Wigand, won't talk to him. When the company leans hard on Wigand to honor a confidentiality agreement, he gets his back up. Trusting Bergman and despite a crumbling marriage, he goes on camera for a Mike Wallace interview and risks arrest for contempt of court. Westinghouse is negotiating to buy CBS, so CBS attorneys advise CBS News to shelve the interview and avoid a lawsuit. 60 Minutes and CBS News bosses cave, Wigand is hung out to dry, Bergman is compromised, and the CEOs of Big Tobacco may get away with perjury. Will the truth come out?—<jhailey@hotmail.com>",
