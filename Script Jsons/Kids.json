        "Paul": "A medium sized apartment building on the Upper East Side. Cars are speeding by the front of the building. Cabs drive by and beep their horns.  Telly and Casper are sitting on the front steps. Telly rings one of the buttons. The bottom switchboard is plastered with skateboarding stickers and \"Legalize Marijuana\" stickers. A Vespa scooter is parked on the outside in front of the building, it also has stickers on it.  Telly rings it again. It is a very hot day, both boys are wiping sweat from their bodies.    Hello?    Hello?    There are about ten guys in the apartment. There is almost no furniture, just two white couches and a few plants in the corner. There is a big TV in the center of the floor. A Nintendo with several wires is hooked up to it. There are various games spread out. A couple of boys are huddled around the game, as they watch the guy play, they breathe in the wip-it's.  The boys are all young and spread out. There are people lying on the couch, on the floor, on the phone, in the kitchen smoking pot and doing wip-its. They are all colors and sizes.  Casper and Telly go to each person and greet them with a handshake. Some people they hug. They say \"Was up,\" to everyone.  They both sit down on the floor and continue to drink their beers.  Paul sits down besides them.   What are you guys doing?   You want a wip-it?   They're good for you. Vitamin C for the new generation.  Paul hands Casper another cartridge.   I don't know, eight or nine.   Everywhere. Fuckin flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.    Some of the guys are sitting in front of the couch doing wip-its. Casper is chewing on a microwave burrito and watching the guy next to him play Nintendo. He is blowing into the burrito.  They are in the midst of a conversation.   That's the one thing. They expect you to be so gentle, so kind...    Continued talking.  Casper is playing the video game. He is playing with a great deal of intensity.   Yeah. But when it's just you and them. That's like the first thing they go for.  Casper starts a new game.    Continuing the conversation.  Telly is looking straight into the CAMERA.    Continued talking.   That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.    Jennie walks up the stairs to Paul's apartment. She takes her finger down the list of names.  She rings his bell. Paul sounds really messed up.    Hello.    Is Telly there?   This is Paul. Who is this?    Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?   Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.  Jennie walks down the stairs. A little white girl is sitting on the bottom stair, playing with a black doll. The doll has no hair and it's dress is ripped. She looks up at Jennie.",

        "Javier": "",
        "Telly": "You know what I want to do?   What do I want to do?    Why?   Because your a virgin?   You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.   Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.   I don't know. I just think that you would love it.   What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.  Telly scoots up to the girl and starts to kiss her. He sticks his tongue in her mouth. They kiss.    You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.    Of course I do.    Virgins. I love 'em. No diseases, no loose as a goose pussy, no skank. No nothin. Just pure pleasure.    Was up bitch?  Casper looks at Telly smiling.   What do you think?    Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.  They both start to laugh.  They move off the stairs and start walking down the sidewalk. The two of them are walking down the street, obvious to everything but themselves talking.   Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.   Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.   Did what take?   Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.   But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.   Take a whiff.  Casper takes a huge whiff, the snot in his nose makes a loud sound as he smells Telly's fingers.   Hell's yeah. She was so clean.   You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.   You know what else?   I can tell that she had just entered puberty.   Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.  And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cut when you were little.   And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.  Casper starts to crack up.   And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.   And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.  They both laugh.   I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.   Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.   I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.    That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.   I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.   Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.  They stop walking. Casper takes the last sip of his beer, then throws it toward an orange trash can. He misses the can and the bottle smashes in the middle of a busy street.   What do you want?   Are you hungry?   You wanna go to Paul's house?   I'm sue he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.   I don't know, he quit dealin but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.   Probably.   78th.   Yeah.   A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.   I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.   I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.   Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.   Yep.   You thirsty?   You got any money?   You down with the boost?   Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?   Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?   Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.   I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?   The cartoon?   Yeah.   Right.   Right.    Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.    Can I do it? I just brooke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.  Casper is jumping up and down on Telly's shoulder.   It's me. Telly.    Paul it's Telly. Open up.  A buzz is heard.  There is a little girl sitting on the bottom step, playing with a doll. Casper runs down and gives her a peach. Then he runs back up.  Telly and Casper enter the building.  The little girl tosses the peach to the ground.    Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.   Nah.   So, how many people live here now?   Where does everyone sleep?   Jennie who?   Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?    But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.   I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.   No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.   All I know is that condoms suck. They don't work. They break. They slip off. It's impossible to feel anything. They make your dick shrink. But I still use 'em. Or at least I did once.    Yep.  Playing the video game.   He looks like my uncle.  Casper looks at the money collection.   I wanna fuck Darcy.   Darcy. Benny's little sister.   Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.   Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.   It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?   She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.   I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.   And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on.  Casper starts laughing.   I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.   At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.   I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.   I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.   I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.  At this point the sound of the subway door is heard. A black man with no legs pushes himself through with his hands. He has a large container filled with change. As he enters, his cup of change is heard smashing back and forth. His face is even with people's knees. A random few stuff change and dollar bills into his cup. He sings as he pushes his way through the cat. He has an afro pick sticking out the back of his head. He is wearing a shirt that says \"KISS ME I'M POLISH\".   I don't understand why you do that.   That.   Yeah. Why you give money.   That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.   Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.   So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.   Right.   Shut up.   Good luck?    Telly and Casper walk up to the house. Telly lives in a flat on St. Marks; downtown. Two Spanish hoodlums are sitting on the front steps. Telly and Casper walk up and slap their hands.  Casper looks for some place to hide his beer. One of the hoodlums puts his hand out and Casper gives it to him.  Telly opens the door with his key and Casper follows close behind. They walk straight to the end of the hallway and enter.  Telly's house is cluttered. The house is nice but organized. The kitchen has pots and pans hanging from the ceiling. There is a Matisse poster hanging in a frame. Large bookshelves filled to the gills with books. Big plush couches in the living room, a rocking chair in the corner. A small wooden piano. A scattered game of Monopoly is on the dinning room table, a few cats roam the house. On the wall are pictures of Telly as a young boy, and large family portraits.  Telly and Casper walk into the living room, then enter the kitchen.  Telly's mom is in the kitchen breast-feeding a small baby. She has her hair pulled back and her breast out. There is a small television set on the kitchen counter that she is watching.   Hi mom.   We were out trying to find a job.  Pouring the Kool-Aid.   I don't know. Find a job.  Hey can I borrow some money?  Casper is staring at Telly's mom as she breast-feeds.   But then I won't need your money.   Yeah.  Telly walks out of the kitchen and up the stairs, Casper slowly staggers behind.  As they walk up the stairs, Telly pulls his shirt off and wipes his underarms and chest.  Casper pulls Telly's arm.   Shut the fuck up.  The two of them enter Telly's parents room.     The bedroom is messy. There are clothes lying on the bed and floor. There is an exercise bike in the corner. Museum posters are on the wall. Tampons on the dresser.  Casper follows Telly into the bedroom. Telly sticks his head out the door to make sure his mother isn't coming.  Casper picks up a tampon and starts playing with it.  Telly opens his mother's shoe closet. All her shoes hand from a big wooden door. He goes directly to a pair of black dress pumps. He pulls out the shoes and puts them under his arm, then he puts his hand in the shot slot and pulls out a pair of shoulder pads with a rubber band rapped around them. He pulls off the rubber brand, and in between the shoulder pads is a small wad of cash. He takes out the cash and sits on the bed counting it.  Casper is pushing the tampon back and forth inside the plastic shell.   Twent, twenty-five, thirty-five, forty-five, fifty.  Casper is looking at himself in the mirror.   I don't know. How much do you want?  Casper is looking at teeth in the mirror.   Fifteen for me.  He puts fifteen dollars in his back pocket.   Ten for you.  Casper is scrapping his teeth with the tampon while looking in the mirror.  Telly stands up and hands Casper the ten dollars. Caper puts the money in his back pocket.  Telly picks up his mother's shoulder pads and puts the remaining cash between them. He stuffs the shoulder pads into the shoe slot. He picks up his mother's black pumps and puts them into the slot. He shuts the door.  Telly picks up his shirt and walks out of the room.  Casper throws the tampon into the trash and follows Telly.     His room is a total mess, worse than imaginable. His clothes, the furniture, piles of porno magazines and science books, are all covered with candy wrappers and potato chip bags. His television is on a scrambled station. He has one big poster of Albert Einstein on his wall. He has a water bed. He has a few small plants next to his windowsill.  There is a cat sleeping next to his bed.   Get the fuck out of here cat!  Telly kicks the cat out his door. Casper shuts the door.   You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?   Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.  Casper is sitting on the water bed, he is pumping one of Telly's small ten pound dumbbells.   You are?   You want some?  Casper is still pumping.   Why not? You stink.    Mom is watching a soap opera on television. The baby is in a small rocker on the counter. She is rocking it back and forth with one hand while smoking a cigarette.   Mom.    I'm gonna go out for a little while.   Not too late.   Not too late.  Casper and Telly walk to the door.   Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.   All right.  Casper waves good-bye.   None of that twigs and pebbles shit.  Another guy trying to sell drugs walks up, but Ras just pushes him away.  Telly pulls the money out of his back pocket.  Ras pulls out a dime bag and pushes it open. He looks around and then puts it in Casper's face.   You think so?   He still does.   It's not his fault. He had a hard life.   You've heard the stories right?   Well, one day Casper had a stomachache and he got permission from his teacher to leave school early and go home.  Casper walks up to a nice middle-class home, it could be in Queens or Brooklyn, it doesn't matter. He pulls out a key and opens the door. He enters his home.    So he walks into his house and hears some strange noises.  The sounds of his mother screaming from upstairs.   The noises were coming from upstairs. In his parents room.  Casper's mom continues to scream from upstairs.   So, this freaked the hell out of Casper. He was just a little kid and he wasn't sure what to do.  Casper moves off the step and runs into the kitchen.   So he ran and got a big knife. The same knife his pops used to cut the turkey on Thanksgiving with.  He opens a drawer full of silverware and pulls out a humongous glistening knife. He picks it up, and it shines on his face.  As his mother screams he looks up at the ceiling with the knife in his hand.   So he heard his mom's screams, and knew that she was in trouble. It sounded like she was getting ready to be killed. Like someone was kicking her in the head.  Casper runs down the hall and opens the door to his parents room.  What he sees is very shocking. His face becomes extremely animated.  Casper's mom is on the bed. She is completely naked except for a pair of bright red high heel shoes. In between her legs is a man wearing all black, including a black ski mask and motorcycle boots. He is having sex with Casper's mom. He has her arms pinned down on the bed. He is grunting like a pig.  Casper watches for a moment in awe.   So Casper opened the door and he saw some big guy with a ski mask fucking his mother. What a sight for an 11 year old kid.  Casper runs up to the bed. He climbs on top of the bed with the big knife in the air, all the while the man in black is having sex with his mother. And they don't even notice Casper at first.   And he goes and jumps on his parent's bed. And for a second he just looks and watches.  Casper takes his knife and starts stabbing the guy in black, over and over. His mother is kicking and trying to stop him. All the while, she is screaming outrageously and blood is pouring out.   And you know. Casper loved his mom, he didn't want anything to happen to her. So he started stabbing this guy, over and over. But it was a mistake.  Casper's mom is kicking Casper as he stabs the man.  Casper is biting his tongue as he stabs the man.  The man falls off the bed and onto the floor.  Casper's mom is going totally nuts. She is completely naked, with blood all over her body. There is blood all over the sheets. His mom is clawing her face in complete hysterics.   So Casper killed his father. He came home with a stomachache and ended up murdering his pops. It was a very embarrassing thing.    So that's why Casper is how he is.   Yep.   No. I was just kidding.   I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.    Uh oh. Casper's in the mix.  He quickly walks up.     Darcy!!!  Darcy!!!  Bennie, a skinny 18 year old, sticks his chest out the window. He's chewing on an apple and not wearing a shirt.  He looks down at Telly    Hey Bennie. What's up?  Bennie is munching on his apple.   Is your sister home?   Yeah.   Hold up man.  Darcy sticks her head out the window. She is very pretty, very young, clean, and innocent.   Hey. What are you doin right now?   Don't take a bath. Come swimmin with us!   Come on. Come swimmin with us.   Yeah. Come on.   I hope so. For now.   I like 'em new. Not like you.   You look nice.    Is it cold?  Darcy puts some water in her hand and does the same thing.   You know I've been thinking about you lately.   Yeah. After I saw you last week.   Yeah.  Darcy smiles. She looks a little bit embarrassed.   I was lookin for you all day today.   Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.  A quick three second flashback of him having sex earlier that day with the young virgin girl. It's very loud as she screams.   I was like. I gotta find Darcy. Where is she at? I was lookin all over.  Darcy smiles.  Joy and Kim are sitting next to each other on the steps in the shallow end of the pool. Steven, Harold, and Casper are in the water in front of the girls.  Joy and Kim are both wearing bras.   Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?   She won't? Why not?   Yeah. I can understand that.  Back to the shallow end with Casper, Steven, Harold, Kim, and Joy.   You should come back with me to Steven's house.   Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.   Come on. You can rave on another night.  She looks at him.   Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug  out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.   Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring.    Do you like kissing me?   Do you like me?  Darcy nods.   I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.  Darcy kisses Telly. She begins to suck his bottom lip.   I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.   No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.   Hey Steven. Yo Steven.  Steven continues to make out.   Come on man. Steven.  Steve turns his head, he looks sweaty and red.   Yo, let me get in your parent's room man.  Just fir a litte while.   Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.    Trust me. Don't be nervous.  He starts feeling her up.    I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.   I just know. I know you'll love it.   I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.   Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.   I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.   Of course I do.    That's it. You're doin fine. Come on Darcy. That's it.  He looks up at the door and notices someone is watching.   Shut the fucking door!!!  Jennie slams the door shut.  Telly continues having sex with Darcy.    When you're young. Not much matters. When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got. When your young. A lot of the time fucking is all you have, hen you go to sleep at night, you dream of pussy. When you wake up, it's the same thing. It's in your face, in your dreams, you can't escape it. Sometimes when you're young, the only place to go is inside. That's just it. Fucking is what I love. Take that away from me, and I really got nothin.  The CAMERA focuses on Casper. He is sitting up awake on the couch. All his clothes are off.  He looks straight into the CAMERA.",
        "Deli": "",
        "Owner": "Whah?   Whah is dissdee?  Casper is going through the beer section. He pulls out two 40oz. bottles of and puts them on the floor.   I no understand you. Maybe crazy.  A round mirror is reflecting Casper putting the bottles into his backpack.   Whah you say? Dissdee?  Casper runs up to the counter and grabs his crotch.",
        "Girl": "Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.    Oh yes, Telly it hurts, oh yes, oh yes, please Telly, Telly.  The CAMERA backs up to reveal Telly having sex with the girl. Telly is seventeen years old. He is short, dirty, slightly muscular, he has an interesting face, he is a street-smart punk, He is biting his bottom lip, the two of them are sweating like mad, the sound of the bed post smashing against the wall combines with the rhythmical moaning of the two.   Yeah.   You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.   Because, you know why. You know.   Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.   Why is that?   I wouldn't believe it?   But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.    Do you care about me?    As she screams in total agony. Telly and the girl are on the bed having sex. All the lights are on. This scene should look very white and bleached out, very electric and shocking. Everything should be exposed as Telly takes advantage of the virgin girl.   My dolly is black... Lucy.  The girl sticks her doll out so Jennie can hold it.    You don't have to look at us. It's not a free show.  She continues making out.  Everyone laughs. The music is loud and adds to the intensity of the scene.   Hey Casper. Why do they call you Casper?   But that's not your real name. No one's name is Casper.",

        "Ruby": "Five girls are sitting in a small room. They are smoking. They're all in a circle laughing. The girls are all good friends. A few of them have rings in their lips and eyebrows. A big dirty fish tank is on one of the bookshelves.  Ruby is a nice looking girl, age 17. She is Spanish, her hair is slicked back, she chain-smokes.  Jennie is a 15 year old high school sophomore. She is white. She is very pretty, with an uncommon touch of innocence about her.  The next episode is going to jump-cut back and forth between Paul's apartment and Rubby's room. These scenes should be handheld.  Ruby hangs up the phone.   Telly says was up.   You still mad at him?   He stole her virginity. He took it away and now it's gone forever.  Laughter.   That shit is nothin. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.   And we did it in the bush. Like outside around midnight. I got fucking mosquito bits all over my ass. And we thought everyone was sleeping, but they obviously weren't because everybody knew. And it was out on the grass somewhere. And it hurt like a motha, oh my god the pain!  Laughter.   The pain. The fucking pain!   You are being ripped open.   Did you bleed?   You didn't?   I bled. I bled like on the condom, there was blood everywhere. And you know what he started singing? He started singing \"Sunday Bloody Sunday.\" That stupid fucking song.  Everyone is cracking up.   I was like... I was like... No. They sang that the whole sleep away. My reputation!   I know.   Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.   Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!   Making love is like.   It's grandmother style.  Jennie is cracking up and pounding Ruby's back.   It's like...   Yeah.   It's really slow. It's slow boring.   It's very monotonous.   Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...   Boom!!! Boom!!!     In the midst of their conversation.   Hell yeah, they don't know.  They all start laughing and clapping hands and snapping fingers.   Mine?   Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...   And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco   And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...   He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.  She starts pounding her fists.   I was like ripping his hair out. And we kissed like so hard that our lips were busted. And that shit was so good. It was crazy.  They slap hands and laugh.    He was like ripping my hair. I was like oh yeah.  Work it.  They all crack up.   Yep.   Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!   To come?   Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.   Yeah I get bored.    In the midst of their conversation.   Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.   Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.   And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.   I have.  They all laugh.   It was... it was.   No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.   You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.  Laughter.   The only way you can get it out is like if you eat like a real meal.     Laughter accompanies their conversation.    Continued talking.   I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.   And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.   And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.  Jennie looks embarrassed.   I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.   17.    Umm. Altogether?   Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.   With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.    Yes.   Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.   Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.    ... I don't know, I think he's mad at me, but who cares...  Ruby and Jennie stop talking and look at the black nurse. She is coughing uncontrollably. She looks like a large shaking figure. A skinny nurse walks by, pounds her on the back, and she stops coughing.  The black nurse has a smile on her face, her eyes watery. She turns and looks at Ruby.   Wish me luck.   Yes!   Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.   Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.   Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.   Get the fuck outta here man!    I said get the fuck outta here before I smash your fucking face in mothafucka!!!   Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.   I'm coming.   Jen!  Jennie looks back at Ruby and then starts running down the street.    Jennie!  Jennie is running down the street full speed. She is passing all the people on the sidewalk. Then she darts across the street and through the traffic. Some people stare. She continues to run as the CAMERA follows her for a full block. She bumps into people and pushes them away.",
        "Casper": "Shit.   Oh shit what happened?   Casper is very excited. He stands up and pulls Telly's arm.   You fucked it?  Telly laughs and Casper jumps up and down.   I knew you fucked it! I sat out her for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!   Well, how was it?   She can fuck?   Oh shit. How long did it take?   How long did you fuck her?  They cross the street, paying no attention to speeding cars. Casper is listening to every word that Telly says. Casper seems much happier than Telly. Telly is laid-back. Casper is hyper as he jumps up and down and claws Telly's arm.   Yeah.   How did she smell? Did her puss stink?  Telly puts his four fingers together and then puts his hand in front of Caper's nose.   Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.   Oh man, that's the best.   Let me smell it again.  Telly lifts his fingers once again, as Casper breathes in the odor.   That's why virgins are the best. I love that smell.  As they walk down the street, joggers, men in business suits with briefcases, ambulances, and women with baby carriages all pass by.   What?   How?   Right.   Yeah.   Yeah.   Fuckin perverted bastard.  They continue to laugh and walk.   To what? Virgins?   What do you mean?   You mean like fucking two virgins at once.    She's probably smash you in the fucking face.   Did you tell her that you loved her?   Shit.   Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.   Hell yeah. Fuckin starvin. Wait up a sec.  Casper takes two steps away and starts urinating in someone's bushes. People walk by and stare.   What for? That guys a dick.   You think he's got any herb?   You think?   He lives on 76th?   Den less go Joe.  He zips up his pants.  They start walking again. Casper is carrying a folded up comic book in his hand.   Telly.   Did she suck your dick?   Why?   It is right.   It's no big deal, right?   Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.   They're gonna tell their grand kids.  That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!  The two of them are laughing, their conversation has gotten them very excited.  They walk in front of a Korean grocery. The grocery has a small outdoor produce section, juice, fruit, sodas, etc. A KOREAN GUY with flip-flops and headphones is sitting on a tall wooden stool.   Yeah, I feel dehydrated.   Three pennies and a ball of lint.    Unzip my pack, yo.  He turns around and Telly quickly unzips his backpack.    He said This Dick, mutha fucka! Can't you understand English?  The two of them both run out the door.  Telly taps the Korean man who is sitting outside. The man looks in the opposite direction while Casper grabs two peaches and puts them into his pocket.  The two boys run off.  The Korean man gets off his stool. He pulls his headphones off his ears.   You know like in \"The Wonder Twins\" they share everything.   Yeah. \"The Wonder Twins\". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.   Well, those guys share everything, right?   And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?   And it got me thinkin. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.   No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated \"Wonder Twins\"! The two of them start laughing and jumping on each other. Telly spits out a mouthful of beer.    Can you do it man?   Oh man. I fucking love this guy.  The two of them walk off laughing.    Yeah.  Paul puts his hand on his big pocket and gives Casper a cartridge. Casper breathes in the wip-it and then smiles really big.   I love these shits.   That's why I like 'em. They wake my brain up.  Casper does the wip-it.  STANLEY, a tall black kid with dreads, walks out of the kitchen. He has a cordless phone in his hand. Casper continues to do wip-it's. One after another.   That girl you boned last year. Remember?   Yep.   Yeah me too nigga.    You know what I notice?   I notice that girls love to give head. It's like a secret pastime hobby for them. Or somethin'.   All girls. They love it. I know.  Casper's game finishes.    I hate this game.   I know. They love it. That's why girls live longer than guys. 'Cause sperm has vitamin C.    Yeah. It's a great big fraud.    Man, this guy is really good.   I bet he makes hella money.  A train comes speeding by.  Casper walks next to the Blind Guy and starts dancing really funny. Telly starts to laugh. Some guy in a business suit walks by and throws some change in the collection.    Who?   Oh. You like her?   Darcy?   Yeah. She's only 13.   Yeah.    Yeah.    Yeah.   I know what you mean.   She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.    How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.   Bet.  The two of them shake hands.   You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?   Yeah. Bless you back.  The legless man makes his way into the next car.   Why I do what?   Why I give pennies?   Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.   What are you talking about?   So.   So. You never know when you can end up like that.   I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.   I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.  Telly is laughing.   So really, it's good luck.   Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.  They both laugh.    Hi.   No none.   Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.   Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.   How do these things work?  Telly is counting the cash.   How much you gonna take?   About ten. Fifteen is good.   Yeah probably.  Telly picks up the small spray bottle used for watering plants, he begins to spray his face and chest.   Yo, you got any weed around here?   Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.   Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.  Casper is pumping and making faces.   I'm gonna get mad diesel. I'm gonna fuck any nigga that tries to step to me.  Telly is wiping his body off with a towel from the floor. He sniffs his arms and then picks up a stick of deodorant and applies it.   Nah.   That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin natural.  The CAMERA stays on Casper while he continues to pump his dumbbell and look at his arm.    Yo, was up Ras!   Nuffin. You gots?   Smells delicious.  Casper starts to laugh.  Telly goes to hand the drug dealer the money. Ras looks around to make sure it's safe.   Thanks Ras.   Nothen B.   Right here.   Maybe Nasa. I don't know.   Yeah.   Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.   Yep. You got a Phillie?   Yep.   Naw, you got it Ham.  Hamilton smiles.   Yeah boy!  Casper hits it again and then hands it to Steve, who takes immense hits.  Two male homosexuals in short shorts walk by holding hands.  Steven turns his head and notices them. He exhales the smoke out of his nose.    Fuckin faggots!!!  Everyone starts laughing.    Faggots!!!  Casper rubs his throat. People continue to laugh.   My throat.  Telly is sitting away on the cement benches under the tree. He is talking to Misha.    The house is dark. Plastic on all the furniture. A velvet picture of Christ is hanging on the wall in the hallway. Very simple and plain, a generic adobe.  Casper enters his house and flips on a lightswitch.    Get away! Get away! Help! You monster! Please help!  Casper puts his lunch box down and walks to the first stair to listen to his mother's screams.    Stop! Please stop! Oooh help!  Casper runs up the stairs, he is holding the knife straight out.    No! Stop! Get off me!  She is struggling to get loose.   You fuck!!! It's your father!!! We were playing a game you fuck!!! That's your father!!! We were just playing!!!  Casper looks very confused as he looks at his naked mother. He has the knife in his hand, and a little blood on his T-shirt and cheek.  Casper's mom continues to yell at him.   Casper, you fucker!!! Oh, my god!!! Help me God!!!  Casper looks at his mother, then he looks at the dead guy on the floor. He bends down and takes off the mask. It's his father.    That's my dad.    You fuck. You killed your father!   Yo, that weed is mad good.  Hamilton gets ready to puff.   Yo, sorry money.  The hoodlum is a good seven inches taller than Casper. He puts his arms out like he's upset.    Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.   Nuffin G. Just forget it.   Sup then? Sup?   Sup. Sup.   I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.  They are both right about to swing.  Everyone in the whole park has turned their attention to the scuffle.  All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Harold runs up behind the Hoodlum and with the truck of his skateboard, smashes the guy in the back of the head. A huge thud is heard and the hoodlum just kinda falls forward on his knees.  Casper, with a big smile, steps back and kicks the guy in the face as hard as he can.  Everyone gets in a big circle around the fallen hoodlum. They're all screaming. Even the girls are screaming. \"Fuck 'em up!\"  Harold continues hitting the hoodlum with his skateboard.  Hitting him on the legs and stomach.  Casper is jumping up and down on the hoodlum's head.    Suck my dick! Suck my dick! Suck my dick!  All of a sudden, all the skateboarders in the park, including Hamilton and Steven, take their boards and start smashing this guy, over and over.  The hoodlum is on the ground holding his head, as everyone frantically tries to kill him.  The focus should be on the face of the skateboarders. How much they are enjoying this. They continue to pound him, over and over, like animals in on the prey.  This should look very scary, as twenty guys try to kill the fallen hoodlum. Even little kids are in the middle, beating the guy.  Telly looks up to the sky. He makes a loud noise as he clears his throat, like he's gathering mucus. Then he puts his arms down and stops some of the kids from hitting the hoodlum. His face is completely cracked and bloody. Telly steps over him and spits a huge phlegm wad onto his face.  Casper, still smiling, kicks the guy in the face.   Suck my dick, Suck my dick. Suck my dick.  Everyone stops kicking the guy and they all get kinda silent and look at him. He looks completely twisted, bloody, and dead.  Casper bends over, right in his face.    Now get in my way! Bitch.   Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin.   Damn bitch. Don't kill it.  Telly hands the bottle back to Casper.   Na.   I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.   Yeah, he was crawling around and shit.   Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.   That's OK. Cause that's how I'm livin.   Geez Kim. Your body looks fuckin good.   It's funny how sometimes you can't tell if a girl has a nice body until you see her without her clothes.  Kim smiles.  Harold starts imitating a strong man. He starts flexing his muscles. He's wearing a pair of baggy boxer shorts. Then he turns to Joy.   Oh shit it's fuckin cold.  They start splashing each other.  Darcy and Telly walk over to the other side and sit down on the edge of the pool with their feet in the water.  Telly starts smiling at Darcy. He cups a little bit of water in his hands and pours it on her thigh.  Everyone else is in the water making noise and splashing around.   I'll give you a dollar if you let me suck on your tit.  Kim kicks water in his face.   No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.   I don't know. Your just sitting there. And your tits look clean to me. It makes me  want to suck on 'em.  Telly is sitting in the same spot, talking to Darcy.   You guys are dykes right?   I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.   'Cause Casper is my name.   Damn bitch. That's my name. Why do you always ask me the same shit? Why don't you go lose some fucking weight?  Harold is in the corner with one shoe off. He is sitting next to a pretty oriental girl. He is holding a beer in his hand.   Pussy.  Casper takes another hit.     I'm Casper the friendly ghost. I'm Casper the friendly ghost. Gee you know I'm the most. The girls love me because I'm Casper. The dopest ghost in town. Fuck yeah. Yee haw. Fuckin...  Jennie walks into the bathroom.   Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?   What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.   Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.  Jennie runs out of the bathroom.    What are you worried about for him?     Lucky fuckin bastard.  Casper shuts the door.  He walks back through the hallway and into the living room.  When he gets in the living room, he looks around, then he flops down beside Jennie on the couch. He puts his hands down his pants and starts itching.  Casper looks beside his feet and sees Steven sleeping with his head on top of Kim's stomach.  Casper continues to scratch his balls. Then he looks over beside him at Jennie scrunched up asleep.  Casper looks around to see if anyone is awake in the room. Everybody is asleep.  He scoots up close to Jennie and looks at her.  Casper nudges her shoulder.    Jennie. Jennie.  Jennie does not respond.  As Casper takes his hand off her shoulder, he gently rubs her breasts.  He moves his hand down her stomach and gently between her thighs. He caresses her. She does not feel anything.  Casper bends over and puts his face by her ear.    Jennie. Please wake up. It's me Casper. Jennie.  She does not respond.  Casper starts kissing Jennie's ear. She swats her shoulder.  Casper gets up and looks at her. He stares at her stomach and crotch.  He puts his hands on her jeans and then he undoes her belt. He is very careful not to make any abrupt movements.  As he unclips her jeans he watches her face to see if there is any kind of response.    Jennie. Don't worry. It's me Casper.  He slowly pulls her pants down. She is wearing teddy bear underwear. Casper throws her pants to the ground and then he looks at her legs. With his fingertips he starts caressing her soft skin.  Then he gets off the couch and onto his knees. He puts one leg on his shoulder and the other on the couch. He looks at her and then pulls her panties off.  Casper quickly undoes his pants and gets in betwen her legs.  He puts her hands around his shoulders.  Jennie is sort of coming to but she has no energy. She makes some noise but she is passed out and powerless.  Her eyes are closed the whole time. She is not aware of what is happening.   Shh. Don't worry Jennie. It's me Casper.  Casper has his knees on the floor as he takes advantage of Jennie.  Jennie moves her arms a little bit. Casper is breathing fast and heavy.   Jesus Christ. What happened?",
        "Little": "My dolly is black... Lucy.  The girl sticks her doll out so Jennie can hold it."
