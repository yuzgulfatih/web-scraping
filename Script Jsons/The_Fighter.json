He's not only a great fighter, he's also a pretty great trainer.  Tell 'im about Sugar Ray, Ma. Dicky knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard.  He just won the Gold Medal at the Olympics, Sugar Ray. He was the, ya know, the big new welter weight at that time.  Dicky was undefeated!  It was Dicky's first ten roundah.  It was huge. People still talk about it to this day. It was a great fight.  Quackah! Look who decided to show up, Dicky Donuts.   -Hoppy cut! CARLOS GARCIA, 50, short, Puerto Rican, points back, laughs  I don't know, how?   \"My back! My back! I'm full a yokes!\" Quackah!

Micky fixes himself in the mirror, straightening his button- down shirt, wears an ill-fitting sports coat, looks like a little boy playing dress up. Suitcase open on his bed. This is it, the day before the big fight.   - thanks, Mick, but Dicky taught me everything, he's been in my cornah, ya know. I can't do it without 'im.  What the fuck are you doin'?  We gotta go to the airport now. You know how important this fight is.          Could we please just go to the airport for once? Alice comes around the corner.  Help ya husband up, Alice. Ya husband's on the ground there. Instead Dicky helps Alice up the driveway to the limo. Micky helps his father to his feet.  Close the door.  No. No BooBoo. BooBoo looks to Dicky who rolls his eyes; BooBoo leaves. Micky stares in disbelief.  Next morning, day of the fight. Micky &amp; Dicky hanging out in Micky's room, sitting on the bed watching a video of \"Mamby vs Meekins\" on TV.  Why not?  Mamby got the flu?!  feels his whole fight plan go out the window.  With who?  Mike Who? Mungin?  The last few fights were rough, Lou, this one's 'sposed to be a little easiah.      Hold on, 165's big.  So what? The guy's a middleweight.  He's 20 pounds bigger than me.  You just said that.  How 'bout you go fight him? He's a middleweight.  How many times ya gonna say I knocked out Joey Ferrell? A beats B B beats C so A can beat C? But what if it rains that day, anything could happen --  OK. Joey Ferrell knocked this guy out. And I knocked out Joey Ferrell. They all nod.  I don't spell my name with an 'e.   Dicky, look at that guy. .Dicky's not listening, waving to the HBO cameraman filming ringside... sees SUGAR RAY LEONARD, now 38, sitting ringside, calling the fight for ESPN with AL BERNSTEIN, 40s, salt &amp; pepper hair, mustache.  Dicky, listen to me. I can't lose again. Look at that guy.  Yeah, holy shit, stop lookin' at Sugar Ray and wake up. We'll hafta run the first few rounds, get 'im tiahed, he can't be ready, right? He just got off his fuckin' couch.  He did not just get off his fuckin' couch.  .Micky heads for his corner, blood running, Dicky jumps into the ring, Mickey O'Keefe puts down the stool.. .Micky sits down, ED ALIANO starts to wipe the blood from his face, Dicky takes out Micky's mouthpiece.  (looks up at his brother; knows he can't win  Micky sits on the trainer's table in the middle of the room, showered, dressed, face bandaged. Alice gently touches the back of his neck, whispers in his ear. He nods. She holds his head a few moments. Dicky comes in. HUGS HIS BROTHER.         Where?  You'll pay me to train in Vegas?  What about my brothah?  (looking out window,   No, he didn't mention you.   Yeah I know. That's what I told 'im. Micky looks back out the window, face bandaged, no emotion. The Fighter 8/28/09 GREEN DRAFT 35. 35 EXT. ALICE &amp; GEORGE WARD'S HOUSE - LIMOUSINE  - 35  Nah, I don't think I wanna do this no more.  PAN of photographs of Kasie, Micky &amp; Dicky in the ring after fights; red &amp; white boxing gloves; boxing magazine; flickering TV. Micky lies sleeping in his clothes on the couch, bandages on his head. He sits up, TV playing. He gets up and walks into the small kitchen, grabs a beer out of the refrigerator, swallows some PAIN pills. And picks up the cocktail NAPKIN WITH CHARLENE'S NUMBER AND HEART ON IT. Picks up the phone, starts to dial, stops, looks at the number. Hangs up the phone. Goes back into the living room and lies down on the couch and falls asleep again. FADE OUT.       What,-- What is it? He gets up off the couch and peeks through the shade.. .AND SEES CHARLENE STANDING ON HIS DOORSTEP. Scared, he ducks back down, crouches behind a chair. KNOCKING continues.  I was gonna call, I started to call, but I couldn't call.     How'd you know my house anyway?  Micky sits on the edge of the tub while Charlene carefully re- bandages the left side of his eye and cheek bone. It is quiet for a few moments while Micky looks into her face.  I didn't get to fight the Jewish black guy.   He got the flu, the guy who took his place had 16 pounds on me, I nevah shoulda fought him.  Nobody woulda got paid. Everybody said I could beat 'im.  My mothah and my brothah. She looks at him as she takes this in.  Wow, you look great. You got a nice house.  Oh.  (closes the door, gets into the car Old roommates from where?  You seem to enjoy it. You're very populah down there -  (starts the car, looks over at her What college?  Scholarship? For what?  A high jumpah?! You gotta be kiddin' me.  (drives looks at her raising an eyebrow You?! Charlene laughs lightly through her nose.  Oh yuh, it's a good movie theatah. They have good movies.     Oh yuh. And I heard it's a good movie.   Guy at work - She looks at him puzzled as she they enter the theater.     I don't have a girlfriend. I came here because I don't wanna show my face in Lowell.     What's the difference, I'm alone in the ring anyway.   You can't say that about my family.  Why don't we sit down and hear what's goin' on businesswise?  Oh yuh. That's good, Dick, I'm just, ya know, trying to figure out what's best for me-- Micky tilts his head, cat's got his tongue. They all look at him. Alice lights a cigarette, exhales, tense.  Yeah, I know, Ma. It's just,-- I don't want things goin' the way they been goin'.  I know, but I don't want things to go like they been goin' HERE.  Here, this, us, Lowell. The routine.  You just met her -  We're togethah.  I told you we're together! This is my girlfriend, I want her here.  She don't mean no disrespect. I had a chance to get paid to train year round, that's all she's talkin' about. I think everyone can appreciate that. Dicky stares taking this in, wheels turning.               It's only 5'1\", she did 5'8\" as a champ, right Charlene? 5'8\"? Charlene jogs a little curve to the bar and LEAPS backwards, clearing 5'1,\" landing on the pillows.  Yes! He claps with Kasie as Charlene stands rubbing her ass.  Hey, we gotta get you home Kasie, I gotta business dinnah with Nana.  (kisses his mother hello,  C'mon, c'mon, this is 'sposed to be about the fight, let's just talk about the fight --  Can we talk business?  Just put him in the wagon. Police tackle Micky to the sidewalk, start beating, subduing him with their flashlights... Crack! Crack!    You didn't do nuthin? Look at my hand ya selfish prick.  What were you doin' for me? Officer pauses so Dicky can listen.  This? Do me a favah, don't do nuthin' for me.  Micky sitting alone drinking a beer, left hand in a cast, staring at the floor.    I'm quittin', Charlene, OK? I'm done fightin' I don't need it no more.  What?! Why?  - What else could I do, Charlene?  Hey!  It's good, gettin' there.   Now I gotta worry about this movie tonight on HBO, everybody lookin' at me like I did somethin' wrong, ain't my fault he's on TV.                      It's very sad, ma, I gotta call ya back. He hangs up. He and Charlene stare at each other, taking it in, emotional, awkward. She laughs a little through tears. - .they hug. Micky crying into her shoulder and hair, Charlene holding onto him, she backs him into his BEDROOM, the fall to the bed, kissing. FADE OUT -  Next morning. Micky's hands grab dingy white boxing wraps out of the darkness of his messy closet, faded red gloves, throws them into an old blue gym bag, leaves. Charlene sits up in bed, groggy, gets up in Micky's t-shirt, goes out.  Micky stands at the top of the stairs, old blue gym bag slung over his shoulder, early morning. He looks out at morning...      I wanna meet that guy George told you about. [pause] The one with the cab company. Charlene nods, Micky disappears down the stairs; she runs to the edge of the balcony, looks down, waits, in a moment Micky's back appears from under the porch, walking away. She watches him go.     You own a cab company, you're a good businessman, right?  Get ya confidence back.  Don't answah the door.  I'm not hidin' from nobody -  Why ya always lookin' out for him, Ma? Wes? Why's it always Dicky, Dicky, Dicky -  Yeah, a funny way, Ma, Dicky's a great trainah, I love him to death, but do ya evah think all the othah damage he's done?  Don't ever lay a hand on Charlene.  (lets go of his mother, breaking up the fight HEY! HEY! For the love a Christ!  They look at each other, tearful, heartbreaking. Red Dog and Beaver put their arms around her and walk her to the car.   I do not spell my name with a friggin' \"E.\"  I know you know what I'm doin'. I'm sure Alice, everybody else, told you, I wanted to tell you to your face, myself. I got new management, I'm workin' with Mickey O'Keefe, and it's going good.     Of course, how could I stand a chance without the Great Dicky Ecklund in my corner? You didn't care if I got killed with Mungin, now all of a sudden, you're worried Sanchez is gonna hurt me, why? Cuz you're stuck here and you can't be center of attention no more.     I ain't here to talk about that!  Watch the fight, you'll see the plan.  Ya gonna shit on it no mattah what I say! '   Go toe to toe; ovahhand right in the middle rounds. He's weak against the overhand right.  Fuck you. I'm gonna go. (Stands]   You're not me. You can't be me. You had a hard enough time being you when you had your chance. I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight. Walks out.   He hits like bricks. When he misses it hurts. 99 RING - THOMAS &amp; MACK CENTER - 8:31 PM 99 100 ALICE &amp; GEORGE WARD'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 100 the fight with her.

You want me to stop it? I'm gonna stop this fight, Micky. I sweah to Christ, I'll stop it. I don't know what ya doin' but ya bettah do it soon.    -- Dicky Donuts lookit ya! They let ya keep the new teeth!  You look good, your eyes are clear.  That's beautiful, Dick. There's somethin' we gotta talk about.  I made a promise to them that I wouldn't work with you again. Dicky takes this in. Stunned.  I had to. After everything that happened. I'm sorry. Dicky is hurt, stunned.  I'm glad you're back, I'm glad you're doing good, I don't know what else to say.  I wouldn'ta won Sanchez without Dicky.  Because it's true. I went in with our plan and it wasn't working, I switched to what I learned with Dicky. Micky looks at O'Keefe, who is hurt.  I wouldn'ta won it without you, either, O'Keefe, you know that.  I'm the one fighting, not you, not you, and not YOU. I know what I need.  I want Dicky back. And I want you, Charlene, and I want O'Keefe, and my family.  You sound like them now.  Can this be my fight, for once, Alice, huh, just once, maybe just this one time, not for Dicky? I know you think he's comin' back, he's 40 years old and doesn't have a tooth in his head that's his own--  Shut up!  Shut up! Dicky, hurt, stops.     Good. Get O'Keefe back, too.  You went ten rounds, and he never hurt you. You were my hero.   Do you want a ride home?  HEY. Nobody goes on stage. Just me and the manager, that's how it's done by the professionals.

I like my bed an' my girlfriend too much - He waves at Charlene in the crowd. Reporters laugh. Neary glares at Micky and steps off the scale. Micky sees Alice squeezed way in the back of the room with George, both all dressed up, new clothes, hair done up.      My muthah used to manage both of us, me and Dicky both. Neithah of us would be here if it weren't for her, right?

Trying to complete a newly paved road to the right which ends in this intersection. The scraping tool spreading the new asphalt. Micky sweating, dirty from asphalt.

Catch a glimpse of her tough, sexy, fighter's nose, years of hard life, bleached-blonde hair, sucking on a Lucky Strike, drinking by at a white-topped table cluttered with empty beer bottles, overflowing ashtrays, cigarettes burning out.           Dick Ecklund and I were separated. It's not like I was foolin' around. Producer looks confused.  That's not helpin', George.  What's he doin'? Where's Dicky?  Outta the ring, O'Keefe, you can't do what my Dicky does!   Oh, Micky. Micky's a clown. Dicky went to the store for me.

This fight was gonna change our lives forevah, and it did. BACK TO VIDEOTAPE, 2ND ROUND, Dicky, 21, bobbing moving versus Sugar Ray, 21.

Leonard still hasn't solved his speed, still hasn't been able to find him, I think in his own cute way Ecklund is making Leonard be the aggressor..\"  Ahh! Dicky! Quackah!   My Dicky can do anything! Micky looks over annoyed.  Dicky taught him that!   Both my boys are gonna do it!
