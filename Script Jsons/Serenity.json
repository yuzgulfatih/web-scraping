        "The": "That's only Reavers.  Reavers aren't real.  Full well they are. They attack settlers from space, they kill them and wear their skins and rape them for hours and hours --  As the top pops off like a bouncing betty , flying up over Simon and River's heads and then bursting forth in a flat circle of blue energy that bisects the room, flowing through the staff's heads and knocking them out. Simon rushes to River, gently removes the probes from her head and swabs her, whispering:  Stop. The action freezes.        Biograph. Simon Tam.        Enter the doctor.  Forgive me. I prefer to see the event alone, without bias. Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is.  You're right to insist. I know you've had security issues here. He places his hand on a screen as he says it. Mathias looks at the readout, and drops the bluster.  I have neither. Like this facility, I don't exist. The Parliament calls me in when... when they wish they didn't have to. Let's talk about the Tams.  River was your greatest success. A prodigy -- A phenomenon. Until her brother walked in eight months ago and took her from you.  I'm very aware of that.  No, no. Of course. The boy spent his fortune developing the contacts to infiltrate this place.  Madness, no. Something a good deal more dangerous. Have you looked at this scan carefully? At his face? Mathias looks uncertain.     I'm here because the situation is even less simple than you think.  Do you know what your sin is, Doctor?      Key members of Parliament. Key. The minds behind every diplomatic, military and covert operation in the galaxy, and you put them in a room with a psychic.  It's come to our attention that River became much more unstable, more... disturbed, after you showed her off to Parliament. Did she see something very terrible in those cards?  But they are in her. Her mind is unquiet. It's the will of the Parliament that I kill her. And the brother. Because of your sin.  (continuing; moving to his briefcase You know, in certain older civilized cultures, when men failed as entirely as you have, they would throw themselves on their swords.  The Parliament has no further interest in psychics. They represent a threat to the harmony and stability of our Alliance.  Would you be killed in your sleep, like an ailing pet? Whatever your failings, I believe you deserve better than that. The agents move. He slices the throat of the one behind him with true grace, thrusting at the second as he's pulling out his gun and pinning his hand. A moment, and the dying agent reflexively squeezes the trigger, shooting his own arm. The Operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as quietly as the first. Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall. He bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the Doctor's spine. Mathias stiffens, suddenly, agonizingly immobile. The Operative steps back, observes the Doctor's rigid grimace for a moment. Almost ceremoniously, he drops to one knee and holds the blade out to one side, hilt to the floor and point tilted toward the doctor. The Doctor stares at it in horror as his paralyzed body begins to tip over toward it. The Operative turns toward the terrified intern at the door.                    As the mule shoots past the last building, we see a skiff shoot out from behind the buildings of the adjacent street, right abreast of our gang.  We see the church as the first ship and an even larger one come to hover over it, Reavers dropping down on cable lines to swarm into it.     As it heads for the mule --  As it heads for the skiff -- and Serenity swoops down out of Mule swallowed by the bigger ship --     He's Mingo. ,do          The ship. The name of the ship. 10 Crossref. Malcolm Reynolds. Serenity. He looks over at the Ensign with a small, strange smile on his lips -- as his glasses are covered by text.  Serenity Valley. Bloodiest battle of the entire war. The Independents held the valley for seven weeks, two of them after their high command had surrendered. 68% casualty rate.  There. 4     48. His glasses stop scrolling and Mal's military file opens, a picture of Mal in one lens.     She's followed him far... Give me the crew, registered passengers -- Our Captain is a passionate man, no room there for subtlety. He's bound to have some very obvious... CLOSE ON: THE LENS of his glasses. On it is a slowly moving picture of INARA.  -40 .weakness...     I've no doubt. Mal sheds his shawl and robe. Inara kneels at the alter, picks out another incense stick.  That's very thoughtful. But I mean it when I say you're not in any danger.  I think you're beginning to understand how dangerous River Tam is.  It's worse than you know.  That girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship. She's an albatross, Captain. 4     68.  I've seen your war record. I know how you must feel about the Alliance.  Fair to say. But I have to hope you understand you can't beat us.  And you can do that, once you let me take the girl back home. Give me the opportunity to help you.  This psychotic, potentially murderous girl who can't have the slightest awareness of your protection. This is where you \"draw the line\".  There's a number of lives that hang in the balance here. Lives under your care. Are they as whimsical as yourself?     69.  I have a warship in deep orbit, Captain. We locked on to Serenity's pulse beacon the moment you hit atmo. I can speak a word and send a missile to that exact location inside of three minutes. Mal pulls a small device, clipped wires sticking out all around it, and tosses it to the Operative.  Pulse beacon.  How long do you think you can really run from us?  Captain Reynolds, I should tell you so that you don't waste your time: You can't make me angry.  I need her, Captain. River is... my purpose and I will gather her to me. The brother as well. Whatever else happens is incidental. In the greater scheme.  I want to resolve this like civilized men. I'm not threatening you. I'm unarmed.  I am of course wearing full body armor. I'm not a moron. He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking a blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts, but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds. Mal is going for his gun again, turning, and the Operative kicks him in the face, sends him back, gun flying. Mal gets to his feet and they square off. Mal breathing hard, nose dripping blood. The Operative perfectly poised, waiting.  They'll come when they're needed.  Captain, what do you think is going to happen here? They come at each other. The Operative is the much better trained -- he's fluid, his blows sparse and deadly. 40     71. Mal is more bluster and determination, and the operative's precision is wearing Mal down. Mal punches wild -- the Operative counters with a spin-kick V0 to the head that sends Mal to the ground not far from Inara, breathing hard. He tries to rise again, painfully, but Inara places her hand on his arm. The Operative goes to his briefcase by the door, pulls out his sword. His face has taken on that remote kind of fascination as he looks at it.     He's not the plucky hero. The Alliance isn't some evil empire. This isn't the grand arena.  Just a flash bomb. Go! Go!   Forget the pulse beacon, there has to be another way to track the ship -- get a read on the nav sat.  Have you found a nav sat trajectory?   Does he think this is a game?     V0 I'm sorry. But I cannot let you hide and I cannot let you run. Things become... extreme. And we wish for another way.  When God wanted Pharaoh to release His people from bondage -- you know the story? He didn't ask. He sent his plagues down upon Egypt. That's me, Captain. The path to peace is paved with corpses. It's always been so.  I'm not going to live there. How could you think -- there's no place for me there, any more than 40 there is for you. Malcolm, I'm a monster. What I do is evil, I've no illusions about it. But it must be done.  It's not my place to ask.  Maybe not. But you'll keep her close now, and when I blow Serenity out of the air, this will be ended. You're so terribly out of your depth, Captain. Your old boat can't take the pressure.  Yes, your scrambler's code is too old for our seekers. You love that, yes? The small triumph over modernity. You really are the noble savage.  But that's what's going to kill you, Malcolm. Nobility. It confuses your text, which is self-interest. And sin.  What do you believe in? 40     86.  If that were true, you'd be nothing more than a Reaver. Something changes in Mal's expression.        Define \"disappeared\". The Ensign just looks uncomfortable. 4     91.      Lock and fire on my command.  You should have let me see her. We should have done this as men. Not with fire...     Vessel in range, lock on...  Bastard's not even changing course...     That's not good...  Target the Reavers!  Target the Reavers! Target everyone! Somebody FIRE!                 There's a lot of innocent people in the air being killed right now.  You really believe that?  You willing to die for that belief?     You know what your sin is, Malcolm?     I'm sorry. The Operative spins him and DIGS his bunched fingers right into the same nerve cluster that he paralyzed Doctor Mathias with. Mal goes rigid, his face a rictus of pain. The Operative goes near the railing and retrieves his sword. Mal trembles, trying to move -- but nothing happens.        Do we engage? Do we engage? 4     120. Mal and the others tense up. River turns slowly to face the soldiers, blades still gripped... A soldier levels his gun at her, sweaty and frantic... others still shouting... vp INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING The Operative sits in silence, the voices coming over his com:    Do you know what an uproar you've caused? Protests, riots -- cries for a recall of the entire Parliament.  You must be pleased.  I can't guarantee they won't come after you. The Parliament. They have a hundred men like me and they are not forgiving.  I told them the Tams were no longer a threat -- damage done.   They might listen, but... I think they know I'm no longer their man.  You won't. There is...  .nothing left to see. Mal looks at him a moment, then picks up his gear to head inside. The Operative starts away into the rain, then stops to look up at the nose of the ship.

        "Mal": "What was that? He's addressing the pilot, WASH. Flight gear and a hawaiian shirt, toy dinosaurs populating his station -- no old soldier, but just as startled.  Was that the primary buffer panel?  Did the Primary Buffer Panel just fall off my gorramn ship for no apparent reason? Another buck --  I thought Kaylee checked our entry couplings! I have a very clear memory of it --  Define \"Interesting\".   This is the Captain. There's a little problem with our entry sequence; we may experience slight turbulence and then explode.  Can you shave the vector --  Just get us on the ground!  Jayne, how many weapons you plan on bringing? You only got the two arms...  I don't plan on any shooting taking place during this job.  No grenades.  No grenades. First Mate ZOE enters from the lower level. Her mode of dress and military deference mark her as a war buddy of Mal's.  Talk to your husband. Is the mule prepped?   Kaylee! He enters:   Kaylee, what in the sphincter of hell are you playing at? The hall leads to the rust-brown chaos that is the engine room. Working around the engine in a forest of wires, sparks and smoke is the sweetly pretty mechanic, KAYLEE. She passes Mal with a slightly impatient smile as he stands in the doorway, raising his voice above the din.     You told me --  You told me the entry couplings would hold for another week!  My ship don't crash. If she crashes, you crashed her.     17. Steam and electricity shoot at him, backing him up. He turns to see Simon behind him. Simon is more seasoned than before, but still contrasts the Captain entirely in dress and manner. He is implacably proper. Also pissed.        Fear is nothing to be ashamed of, Doc.     I'll look for that next time.   No no, that's not a thing I'm interested in talking over with --   I hear the words \"that's final\" come out of your mouth ever again, they truly will be.  This is my boat. Y'all are guests on it. He heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down to:  And it's time your little sister learned from your fine example.  Some of our jobs are trickier than others --  Didn't say 'want'. Said 'will'. It's one job, Doc. She'll be fine. The passenger dorm has a time-worn warmth that most of the ship shares. Except, of course, for the sterile blue of:  She's a reader. Sees into the truth of things; might see trouble before it's coming. Which is of use to me.     I do, and it's a fact me and mine have been courteous enough to keep to our own selves.  I got one purpose here: keep this boat in the air. I take the jobs I get -- which is less and less, case you ain't been keeping track. He starts away, Simon still keeping pace.     So here is us, on the raggedy edge. Don't push me and I won't push you. Simon starts up the stairs as Mal calls to him:        If Fanty and Mingo are right about the payroll, this could look to be a sunny day for us.  Doctor, I'm taking your sister under my protection here. If anything happens to her, anything at all, I swear to you I will get very choked up. Honestly. There could be tears. He peels out, leaves Simon fuming. Kaylee sidles up to him...  Alliance payroll. There's peace enforcing squads stationed all about this quadrant. Can't use credits out here -- they got to pay their boys in cashy money. Which once a month rests here.  You ready to go to work, darlin'?   Right. Great. Let's go.  Hands and knees and heads bowed down! Everybody, now! Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others. Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks. Mal's gun is long, not unlike Civil War era issue, but very much new in design. The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a great idea. Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right upside-down -- and Jayne grabs him by the legs and CRACK! -- bounces his head right off the floor, knocking him out cold.     You've probably guessed we mean to be thieving here, but what we are after is not yours. So let's have no undue fussing. As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office, finding the small vault locked. 1410     24.   140 The old man punches in the code. What opens is a tiny wall safe. Bundles of bills, some scattered coin. Unimpressive. Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain, peering in.  Is there a fed down there? Be truthful.  War's long done. We're all just folk now.  Listen up! We are coming down to empty that vault! The voice of a young Alliance GUARD comes up from below.  Leg's good, it'll bleed plenty and we avoid any necessary organs...  Well you don't want it to look like you just gave up...     Every heist, he's gotta start yelling my name --   Get on the mule. (to the guard, pointing to the  You get everyone upstairs in there and you seal it. Long as you got air you don't open up, you understand?    Zoe take the wheel --  Get in the vault with the others --  It's too many. Drive, Zoe. A Reaver craft ROARS over their heads. It's nearly the size of Serenity. Torn apart, belching smoke -- a welded conglomeration of ruined ships, painted for war. Predator, pure. It disappears over the rooftops.  Drive! Zoe's face is set with unhappy determination as she floors it, shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust. As they move from him, four Reavers jump out of the shadows and grab the young man. Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun. He nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back. Mal fires twice. The young man takes both bullets in the chest, slumps down dead.  They wanna run us down. The up- close kill. River is squashed down on her back, being very small.  Grab on! Jayne grabs the Mule, legs dangling, pulled out between the two vessels as Mal slams a new cartridge into his pistol.  Is he okay? A bloodied Reaver POPS into frame from under the skiff-top. 4 Everybody takes a moment to look at each other.     32.  Set course for Beaumonde.  First thing, I want these bod -- Simon suddenly punches him in the face, causing Mal to stumble back, and Simon to shake his hand in pain.     I'm a hair's breadth from riddling you with holes, Doctor --  She IS fine! Except for bein' still crazy, she's the picture of health!  Seems I remember a talk about you giving orders on my boat.  No, shiny! I'm sick a' carrying tourists anyhow. We'll be on Beaumonde in ten hours time, you can pick up your earnings and be on your merry. Meantime you do your job. Patch up my crew. A beat.  Doc made his call. They's as babes in a basket when we took 'em in; we sheltered 'em plenty. Man has to cut loose, learn to stand on his own.  I had to shoot him. What the Reavers woulda done to him before they killed him...  We couldn't take the weight. Woulda slowed us down.  Mule won't run with five. I shoulda dumped the girl? Or you? Or Jayne?  Well, Jayne...  And go to Fanty and Mingo with air in our mitts, tell 'em \"here's your share\"? They'd set the dogs on us in the space of a twitch, and there we are back in mortal peril. We get a job, we gotta vo make good. Washenters from the bridge.  Maybe that's why we lost. She's not happy with the reply. Mal climbs down to his room as Wash reaches Zoe, slides his arms around her.     It's not my fault the Doc's got no stomach for Rim living --  What? Swept you into his cleanly arms? Made tidy love to you? They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash have already checked their guns. It works like a lunch automat: Mal sticks his gun in a drawer, pulls out a chit -- the q0 drawer closes and rotates, revealing another empty one. A large bouncer with a shockrod watches impassively.  Oh god! I can't know that!      Mingo. Fanty. 14     43.  He's Fanty. You're Mingo.  Fanty's prettier.  Feel to do some business?  Which means at least four of the guys already in here are yours. All's one. I'll just keep Jayne with me.  Go. Go get yourselves a nice romantic meal.   It's business. We're fine. They leave and the four remaining men sit. Fanty tosses a few coins to a saloon-girl, who does a little fan-dance... ANGLE: THE CORVUE CAMERA'S POV of the men is conveniently blocked by her little dance. Mal's foot nudges a duffel bag of money to Mingo's foot.  Yeah, they're a fine bunch of ruebens.  So I'm noticing. Is there a problem I don't know of? You got 25% of a sweet take kissing your foot, how come we're not dispersing?  Well here's a foul thought. I conjured you two were incompetent; sent us out not knowing there were V0 Reavers about. Now I'm thinking you picked us out because you did.  River...  I think maybe we ought to leave. 10     47.  She's still napping just now. And I believe you've got some storytelling to do. 4     49.     It's likely. I know she meant to Ad kill me 'fore the Doc put her to sleep, which how exactly does that work anyhow?  \"In case something happened.\"  You feel to elaborate on what that something might be? I mean they taught you that fancy safeword, they must've figured she was gonna, what -- start uncontrollably crocheting?  And you never did ask. Mal grabs him and throws him against the wall, in his face.     My ship. My crewi You had a gorramn timebomb living with us!  What if she went off in the middle woo of dinner, or in bunk with Kaylee, did that give you a moment's pause? Simon looks at Kaylee, the truth of Mal's words hitting him.  It's crossed my mind.  What about this? Did this make the... puppet theatre?  You can do that?  Can you go back? See if anybody spoke with her 'fore she acted up, -40 made any kind of contact with her... Mr Universe works the screen. The image rewinds and stops on River coming up to it, looking at it. She whispers the word, \"Miranda\", and starts to move away.     Um... please? Mr Universe has a third screen showing the commercial as  well -- and it starts breaking down, bursts of code showing through. As he does so:  Subliminal. It's a subliminal message broadwaved to trigger her.  Hope that ain't for me, Shepherd.  Then I really hope it ain't for me.  Weren't River that did it, you know that. Somebody decided her brain was just another piece of property to take, fenced it right Vd up.  Hiding ain't a plan?  .but they'll be coming. Alliance is after this girl with a powerful will. I look to hear the tromp of their boots any moment.  I coulda left her there.  I had an out -- hell, I had every  I have a way?  Is that better than a plan?  You just think that 'cause my eyes is all sorrowful and pretty.  Sermons make me sleepy, Shepherd. I ain't looking for help from on high. That's a long wait for a train don't come. 1490     60.  It's of interest to me how much you seem to know about that world.  Have to tell me about that some time.     Whuh huh nuhwhat?  Inara. REVERSE ON: Inara on Mal's screen. We see her from about chest level up. She, presumably, sees the same.  Good as any.   Naked as the day I come cryin'. How's your world?  Still at the Training House?  I remember it as nice enough. picturesque.       You could use a gun hand?  Payment is never not a factor. I could sound out the crew... This pot like to boil over soon?  Well, it would be, I mean I would like to... Kaylee's been missing     Yeah, you left a... got some of your stuff in a trunk, never did get a chance to drop it off.  I didn't look through the... stuff... just sundries I expect.     64 Inara smiles blandly, nods. An awkward beat.     Trap.  If that's the case, then Inara's already caught in it. She wouldn't set us up willing. Might be we got a shot at seeing who's turning these wheels. We go in.  Y'all were watching, I take it. Guilty glances. 4     65  140 You see us fight?  Trap.  They're about. Find us a home. I'll take the shuttle in closer. Zoe, ship is yours. 4dO He starts out, turns back to Zoe.        Dear Buddha, please send me a pony, and a plastic rocket, and --  You invited me.  Well that makes you kind of a tease, doesn't it?  Which led me to the conclusion that you must be in some trouble.  For a woman schooled in telling men what they wanna hear, you ain't much of a liar.     What are you doing?  Speak your piece.  She is a mite unpredictable. Mood swings, of a sort.  It usually is.  Way I remember it, albatross was a ship's good luck... til some idiot killed it.  Yes, I've read a poem. Try not to faint. The Operative moves further into the room. Whenever he moves, Mal counters.  You really don't.  I got no need to beat you. I just wanna go my way.  All I gotta do is let you take one more thing away from me. I've had a lot of things taken in my time. And it may just be that this is one too many.  Well I'm a whimsical soul.  I got no notion that I'm being heroical at all. Any more than I think you're really just a harmless bureaucrat come to help me out. You move like a killer. The Operative is stopped by this. Unhappily, he continues:  You do that, best make peace with your dear and fluffy lord.  Advice from an old tracker: you J wanna find someone, use your eyes.  Oh, a jack-rabbit, me. 'Sides, I never credited the Alliance with an over-abundance of brains. And if you're the best they got...  Why is it that the greater scheme always makes everything not that great?  Great! He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest. The Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for the-doorway. The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from behind.  No back up? We're making an awful ruckus...  I'd start whistling.  .I had him...   I think that I was winning! 4     72.     4 You sure you remember how it -- He nearly falls over as:   I'm fine...  He didn't beat me up --   Give the two of them up. Go my way.  Cutting them loose ain't the same as handing them over.  Don't know who or what, but it's on River's mind. Conjure it might be the reason he's after her.  Look, we get back to Haven in a 'r/ few hours time --  You wanna run this ship?   Well you can't!  I didn't start this.  Are you telling me that because you think I don't know --  I came looking for you.  I start fighting a war I guarantee you'll see something new.      But you fog things up. You always have -- you spin me about. I wish like hell you was elsewhere.  The other way! Find her and-do not engage! Everyone piles out the other way. Simon remains, to look in the window. 10     79. ANGLE: SIMON'S POV: There is Jayne, not moving -- and River pops up right in front of us. He starts, then waits as she opens the door.  Check the shuttles. She coulda 40 snuck in. He pops the panel off and starts wriggling in among the wires.  The government's man, he says you're a danger to us. Not worth helping. Is he right? Are you anything but a weapon? I've staked my crew's life on the a - person-,-- - actual and whole, and if I'm wrong you'd best shoot me now.  Or we could talk more... 40     80.  Because there isn't one. It's a blackrock. Uninhabitable. Terraforming didn't hold, or somesuch. Few settlers died.  Half of writing history is hiding the truth. There's something on this rock the Alliance doesn't want known.   Get the Doc. He moves to the Shepherd, grabs his searching hand.     Shouldn't've been you. I'm so sorry, it was... they should've hit us. They should've hit me.  I seen.     83.  You did what's right.  Doc'll bring you round. I look to be bored by many more sermons 'fore you slip -- don't move --  Yes you are. Book coughs up blood, grabbing Mal. Urgent, almost angry.  Come on, keep it up -- Book grabs Mal's face, talks as though replying to something:  Don't talk at me like a righteous man. You are a killer of children.  So me and mine got to lie down and  Why? Do you know why?  You will never see River Tam. I'm telling you this.  She ain't buckled yet. And the 40 only reason you're talking such a lot is you can't get a fix on us.  Nobody -- ever -- calls me noble.  Only- many-I-know-who still --bel i-eved- in sin just died by your hand.  Not a solitary thing.  Get these bodies together.  Zoe, you and Simon are gonna rope V0 'em together. Five or six of 'em. I want them laid out on the nose of our ship.  Kaylee, I need you to muck the reactor core, just enough to leave a trail and make it read like we're flying without containment, not enough to fry us.  Kaylee, you got a day's work to do and two hours to do it.  14     87.   Jayne, you and Wash hoist up that cannon mount. Goes right on top.  I mean to live. I mean for us to live. The Alliance won't have that, so we go where they won't follow.  This is how it works. Anybody doesn't wanna fly with me anymore, this is your port of harbour. There's a lot of fine ways to die. I'm not waiting for the Alliance to choose mine. He walks through the group, toward the smashed cockpit of the Alliance fighter. Struggling to get out is the badly wounded pilot. He sees Mal coming and raises his hands in surrender. Mal shoots him in the head, turns back.        Didn't see you.  Anything of use in there?  You don't have to stay in the shuttle, you know. There's empty rooms, if you wanna sleep awhile.  Cheerful fellow.  Did you really miss this place?  Why did you leave? Site does lo9}E-at-- t -m-  I, uh, I'd better go check on the VW crew. See how the inevitable mutiny is coming along. They both want to say more. They don't. He goes.  Nothing at all?  Find it.  Gravity's Earthnorm.  Well something sure as hell ain't right... WIDER ANGLE: They're in a CITY. Gleaming metal, spread out for miles in every direction. Portions decimated by fires long since cold, others overgrown with weeds, but mostly intact. But silent, as if trapped in amber.  Beacon's up ahead.  Poison?  Place must've gone hermetic when the power blew. Sealed 'em.  There's gasses that kill painless, right?  Anybody want to bet there's plenty of food around?  I seen so much death... I been on fields carpeted with bodies, friends and enemies -- I seen men and women blown to messes no further from me than you.  But every single one of those people died on their feet. Fighting.   Or, hell, running away -- doing summat to get through. This is... 40  This report is maybe twelve years old. Parliament buried it, and it stayed buried til River dug it up. This is what they feared she knew. And they were right to fear, 'cause there's a universe of folk that are gonna know it too.  They're gonna see it. Somebody has to speak for these people. He pauses. Everyone waits.     That the same grandma told you 4 there was an evil dwarf spirit living in your well?  Mr Universe. We haven't the equipment to broadwave this code, but he can put it on every screen for thirty worlds. He's pretty damn close, too.  No. He takes a long moment, his jaw tightening imperceptibly.     We won't be long.  You'll let us know if anyone else comes at you?     100. DROP BACK WIDE to see: The Operative and ten soldiers are in the room, visible to Mr Universe but not to the screen.  We're too close for them to arm --  Chickens come home to roost... They are suddenly JOLTED by a glancing blow from another ship -- Wash struggles to control her --      What does that mean? 4     103.  Where's the back up? Where's the back up? He and Wash are frantically flipping buttons -- the ship whirs to a semblance of life - -   Everybody to the upper decks! Strap yourselves to something!  Head inside!  Come on. Jayne, rearguard. Zoe slows, looking around her.  We all stay together -- 44     106  Then shut 'em and hide til --  Tell me you brought 'em this time... Jayne smiles grimly, tosses Mal a grenade as he pops his own and fastballs it at the Reavers.  (continuing; moving back to Zoe Zoe... are you here? She looks up at him.  You hold. Hold till I'm back. He takes off -- passes Inara, the two of them holding a look for as long as they can. Then he's in the elevator and gone. Jayne moves over to Zoe. 10   Guy killed me, Mal.  Hard to get to. That's a fact.   Shot me in the back. I haven't... made you angry, have I? I s  You have no idea how true that is. There's no wise-ass attitude in him now. They stand, facing off at ten paces.     I do. 4     112.        Aw hell, I'm a fan of all seven. He headbutts the Operative viciously, then punches him so hard he staggers back, losing his grip on the sword. The Operative responds with a spin kick -- Mal holds up the screwdriver and the Operative swings his foot right into it, gasping as Mal pulls the screwdriver -- and leg it's stuck in -- back as he rockets his fist into the Operative's chin. The Operative goes down hard, dazed, as Mal grabs the sword still in his belly.        Iwo Well, I'm known for that. The Operative drops the blade, mouth open, stumbling back, unable to make a sound. Mal spins him, grabbing both his arms and working his own through them in a twisted full nelson -- then bringing his arms up suddenly, the Operative's mouth going wider as we hear his arms crack. Mal drops him sitting against the railing, picks up his sword, saying:                 It's done. Report? Zoe looks at the badly wounded Simon, is about to give a report -- and the doors start to open behind her. Everyone turns to look, those who can feebly raising weapons, as the square iris of the opening blast doors widens to reveal River, standing alone. She is holding two Reaver blades, is bloody but unbowed. And the only one alive. We hold on her a moment, then the wall behind her is ripped completely away. Behind it, grappling hooks chained to a huge tractor pull the wall away as through the smoke come some fifteen Alliance soldiers, who line up, rifles trained on our gang...  If you're here to tell me we ain't finished... then we will be real quick. The Operative stands just under the canopy of the nose of the ship, framed by the rain behind.     'Verse wakes up a spell. Won't be long 'fore she rolls right over and falls back asleep. Taint my worry.  That don't bode especially well for you... giving the order to let us go, patching up our hurt...  They take you down, I don't expect to grieve overmuch. Like to kill you myself, I see you again.  You still standing there when the engine starts, you never will figure it out. The Operative watches the door shut. A moment, and he goes.   What a whiner...  Think she'll hold together?  Make sure everything's secure. Could be bumpy.  We're taking her out. Should be about a day's ride to get you back to your girls.   You ready to get off this heap and back to a civilized life?  Good answer. He turns and heads into the bridge.  You gonna ride shotgun, help me fly? V0 River is in the copilot's seat, looking intently at the screens and buttons.  Think you can work out how to get her in the -- She is flipping switches without even looking, as the ship hums to life.  Okay, clearly some aptitude for the... but it ain't all buttons A0 and charts, . You know what the first rule of flying is? Well, I suppose you do, since you already know what I'm about to say.  Love. You can learn all the math in the 'verse, but you take a boat in the air you don't love, she'll shake you off just as sure as the turning of worlds. Love keeps her in the air when she oughta fall down, tells you she's hurting 'fore she keens. Makes her a home. River also looks out at the sky. 126.  We'll pass through it soon enough.  What was that?",
        "Simon": "I've heard that.  Tell me about them.   What use do we have for a psychic if she's insane?      How is she physically?  Yes. She always did love to dance. He drops to one knee, slamming his baton to the floor.     We can't make it to the surface from inside. Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps, people heading at them from the other side of the doors. 4wo SIMON  Find a -- But River has, impossibly, scampered up over some lab equipment to the dark top of the corridor, where she holds herself in a perfect split, feet against the walls and outstretched hand holding the sprinkler for support. The doors burst open and two doctors pass by, hardly noticing the lone orderly. Passing right under River.  Get on! He is standing by the window -- and the Security Agent is right behind him, PUNCHING the window with all his might. Simon helps River onto the gurney, then jumps on himself as the Security Agent cracks the glass. The two are whisked up in the gurney, River on her knees, Simon standing beside her holding one of the cables --  I'm not worried.  This isn't fear. This is anger.  I imagine if it were fear, my eyes would be wider.  You're not taking her.  She's not going with you. That's final. 4     18.  Guests? I earn my passage, Captain --  I've earned my passage treating bullet holes, knife wounds, laser burns...  And you want to put my sister in the middle of that.  She's a seventeen year old girl. A mentally traumatized sevente--  And that's your guiding star, isn't it? What's of use.  Do you understand what I've gone through to keep River away from the Alliance?  Are you threatening to --  River... She's lying on her side, looking straight at us. A loose summer dress draped over her small frame.  Now, River, you stay behind the others. If there's fighting you drop to the floor or run away. It's okay to leave them to die. River puts on a huge pair of goggles, looks at her brother.     It's amazing. I bring River all the way out to the raggedy edge of the 'verse so she can hide from the Alliance by robbing banks.  River?  You stupid, selfish, son of a whore ---  \"One simple job! She'll be fine!\"  Never again. You understand me?  Well sleep easy 'cause we're off your boat. Just as soon as River gets her share of the \"bounty\".  â¢ I wish there was... Since he doesn't know what to say, she rattles on:  Kaylee. She turns and heads off. Simon starts in the other direction, but River looks after her and the others.     No, I fear it's not safe anymore. He's heading off and doesn't hear:  Eta Kooram Nah Smech! And River drops to the ground, fast asleep. There is a beat. Mal looks around the bar. He and Simon, who has run up to the entrance, are the only ones standing. He looks down at River. She lies unconscious, helpless.  May I see her?  Safeword.  The people who helped me break River out -- they had intel that River and the other subjects were being embedded with behavioral conditioning. They taught me a safeword, in case... something happened.  A phrase that's encoded in her brain, that makes her fall asleep. If I speak the words, \"Eta -- 4     50.  What?  They never said what --  I brought her out here so they couldn't get to her, I don't even know how they --  I thought she was getting better.  May I see her. Mal steps aside. Simon enters the locker.  I'm sorry...  It's okay, it's okay...  You said something. When you were triggered, do you remember? The Captain saw you say something on the feed...  Miranda.  Show us what? Who is Miranda?  Am I... talking to Miranda now? Nwï¿½ She shoots him a look.  No. Right. But I think somehow when they triggered you it brought this up, this memory --  I won't.  Don't say that. Not ever. We'll get through this. She reaches out and touches his face, affectionately.  Well, the Captain hasn't tossed us in the airlock, so I'd say we're --  River. What will Miranda show us. She thinks.  Whose death? And she starts laughing. Quietly at first, then louder, then almost uncontrollably, screaming in his face:  Needs to see her why?   Did he say anything about a \"Miranda\"?  We'll get off. River and I'll get off at Haven and find some --  It's gonna be oka -- She elbows his throat viciously. He drops to his knees, shocked and gasping, as she spin-kicks him to the ground. He doesn't move. She looks at him a moment, then takes off.   You could've asked... 10  Are you insane?  What's the point of living if you sink to the level of a savage --   Kaylee... Come this way. Come But she looks --  There's no discoloration, nobody's doubled over or showing signs of pain...  More than anything, it looks like starvation.  River...  Do we have a plan?  It's okay... -  Just stay low. I'm right here. 4     109. Jayne moves past them to Zoe, takes position by her.  I never planned... anything. I just wanted to keep River safe. Spent so much time on Serenity trying to find us a home I never realized I already had. She looks at him with soft surprise. 140        Spine's intact --  Lie still. I'm gonna give you something to counteract the -- He stands, looking around him. His bag is over by Zoe.     My bag. Need... adrenaline... and a shot of calaphar for Kaylee... I can't... River...? She is by his side, takes his hand. She has a kind of serenity to her, like she understands something now.     I hate to... leave...",
        "Inara": "Kaylee, are you ever gonna put that capture down?  4 You promised to help me pack.  They're very sweet. But they're not Companions.  On Sihnon we started training at twelve. Years of discipline and preparation before the physical act of pleasure was even mentioned. Most of these girls --  Control. Was the first lesson. And the last and these worlds are not like the Central Planets. There is barbarism dressed up in the most civil weeds. Men of the highest rank who don't know the difference between a Companion and a common whore. It's unsafe.  A who? With a what?  I didn't... have a pirate...         Yes. That would be just like him.     Please tell me you're wearing pants.  Cold. It's autumn here.  Right where you left me.  It is that. What about you?  Oh. Thank you, I... I guess we have something of a problem here. With the locals, I thought maybe...  I'm hoping not. But if you were close at all, you -- the crew -- could take your ease here a while... and there'd be payment...  Soon. Not right away.  I miss her too. I even miss my shuttle, occasionally.  Oh.  Thank you. She disappears. Mal thinks a moment.     I never thought for a second you'd be stupid enough to come!  You knew my invitation wasn't on the level --  I'm fine! I'm. giddy.  Mal, you cannot handle this man. -40     67.  I'm praying for you, Mal.  Oh please. Spend an hour with him. Mal smiles -- then glares at Inara, mouthing \"Hey!\"     70.  I know.  And that's not incense. He turns to look: the incense stick burns away -- rather like a fuse -- and FLASHES in an explosion of light and sound. 40 It's a flash-bomb: The Operative sails back as everything goes smoky white and the sound dies to a tiny buzz. The Operative tries to get his bearings -- and four armored soldiers are in his face, asking him for orders... Mal and Inara are gone. He motions for the men to follow them.  What?  Hang on to something.  I told you to hang on.  We have every reason to be afraid.  Because he's a believer.  He's intelligent, methodical and devout in his belief that killing River is the right thing to do.  I honestly think the only reason we haven't been blown out of the air is that he needs to see her.  I'm uncertain. I would say to be sure of the kill, but... I just know he'll kill us all to get to her.  What is that?  You think maybe it poses some kind of threat to the Alliance?  This isn't the war, Mal. Mal turns, eyeing her.  You came to the training house looking for a fight.  I just want to know who I'm dealing with. I've seen too many versions of you to be sure.  Mal. 10     78.  I'm not trying to tear you down --  I was.  That's right at the edge of the Burnham Quadrant, right?  10     81.  Furthest planet out.  It's not that far from here...     Please, we should talk this over --  Mal. He looks up: she's in the corner looking through that trunk of hers, hands on a long oilcloth wrapped around something.  Maybe. She puts it down and crosses to the bed. He sits by her.  You think anyone's set to sleep? Simon's portioning out overdoses of morphine, just in case.   Sometimes... Not so much right now. A beat. He doesn't look at her when he asks:  Why didn't you ask me not to?     90. Dissatisfied, Mal rises.  But they didn't fall down. None of them. They just lay down.  They just lay down... They notice River now, in the middle of the street, keening. She drops to her knees, clutching her head.     94. As she speaks we see, as she sees, FLASHES: bodies. In homes, in piles: an entire world, gently dead.  Mal...  Mal, I need your help with this. I need you to help me, because I can't -- He looks at her, folds her into his arms. Brings her face to his, not kissing but touching, pressing into each other with the urgency of pulsing, necessary life.  Lift isn't moving...  Keep pressure here...  Right.  I, uh...  I don't know. He looks at her, a smile in his eyes.",
        "Jayne": "we're gonna explode? I don't wanna explode.  I just get excitable as to choice, like to have my options open.  Well, what you plan and what takes place ain't ever exactly been similar.  Cap'n doesn't want 'em.  What are we hoping to find here that equals the worth of a turd?   Shiny. Let's be badguys. Mal turns back to River.  Looks like this is the place. He looks up at Mal, who motions for Zoe to open the front door. She does, and River steps in. ANGLE: RIVER'S BARE FEET -- walking slowly among the hunched- over customers as Mal addresses them.  She's locked up. River suddenly looks around, perturbed. CLOSE ON: a young tough. River looks up at Zoe, alarmed, and silently points to the young man. He is slowly reaching for the weapon in his belt. He finds Zoe's sawed-off nuzzling his cheek.  What the hell is up? You all right? What's goin' on? He holds her, as she whispers, wide-eyed...     Mal! Reavers! The girl's pitchin' a fit. They're here or they're comin' soon. He is already loading up with bags as Mal thinks quickly.  You see 'em? Anybody see 'em? 1J -- and jump on themselves, Mal scanning the area as he hands River up to Jayne's care. As the craft powers up, slowly moving, the young man Zoe kept from trying to pull his weapon bursts out of the station, grabbing the back of the mule.  How come they ain't blowing us out of the air?  Boy, sure would be nice if we had some grenades, don'tchya think? Mal says nothing, keeps firing.  I won't get et! You shoot me if they take me! Mal steadies himself and takes aim, seemingly at Jayne --        I do not get it. How's a guy get so wrong?  Ain't logical. Cuttin' on his own face, rapin' and murdering -- I mean, I'll kill a man in a fair fight... or if I think he's gonna start a fair fight, or if he bothers me, or if there's a woman, or I'm gettin' paid -- mostly only when I'm gettin' paid. But these Reavers... last ten years they just show up like the boageyman from stories. Eating people alive? Where does that get fun? He dumps the body in, she starts the doors closing.  Hell, I been to the edge. Just looked like more space.  You're just in a whinge cuz that prissy doc is finally disembarking. Me I says good riddance. He never belonged here, and his sister's no saner than one of them Reavers.  Well, there is that.  40 I could stand to hear a little more...  My muscular buttocks it's forty --  Reavers ain't business, double dickless. This is all background noise to River, who has moved to the CV screen, on which is a commercial. It's animated, goofy, cartoon animals and anime-style Asian girls all transforming to insane fantasy figures as they sing about:  V0 Whuhuh? She's taking out a group of four, high kicks and perfect precision -- Two men come from either side, one whipping out a knife -- she does a perfect split, grabs his wrist above her head, using his momentum to stab the other one -- Mal fights to get back to the gunrack. The bouncer reaches her and she wrests his shockrod from him, uses it on him, on Fanty and Mingo -- the fan-dancer is bolting and River hurls the rod at her head, knocks her cold... She's everywhere. On tables, chairs, under your legs, using the room itself to take out every single person there. One man hides behind a wall -- impossibly, she swings her leg around the corner and nails his face. Jayne grabs her from behind --      Well don't say it! moo ZOE It only works on her, Jayne.  Oh. Well, now I know that.  And I thought they was gettin' off!  Didn't we have a intricate plan how they was gonna be not here anymore?  No, now that she's a... killer woman we ought be bringin' 'em tea and dumplings!  In earnest, Mal: why'd you bring her back on? 4 Mal looks at Jayne, at all of them. Doesn't have an answer.  She goes woolly again, we're gonna have to put a bullet to her.  Why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal? That ain't so hard --  So no hope of a reward, huh?  Which you was all ready to do not a day ago. What went sour?  That so? 'Cause the corpse I'm about to become is having trouble telling the difference.  You dumbass hogs, the only people she's a threat to is us on this boat!  Hiding under the Shepherd's skirts, that's a manful scheme --  Yes!  Do a damn sight better job'n you. Getting us lashed over a couple of strays...  No offense, Doc, I think it's noble as a grape the way you look to River, but she ain't my sister  and she ain't your crew. Oh, and neither is she exactly helpless! So where's it writ we gotta lay down our lives for her, which is what you've steered us toward.  No, the Alliance starts the war -- and then you volunteer. Battle of Serenity, Mal: besides Zoe here, how many --  -- I'm talkin' at you -- how many men in your platoon came out of there alive? Mal stares at him.  You're damn right I do. He stalks upstairs. There's a quiet moment.   He moves to the aft hall, shuts and locks the door. Goes 40 back to the locker and starts to unlock it, pulling his gun.     How come they ain't waiting? They know'd we was coming, how come they only sent one?  V0 God's balls, there's no way we're going out there! And everybody  is talking at once:  I ain't takin' orders from a man has lost his brainstem -- , -Mal pule-s-his- in his face, steps back, hand on his.  --ai-n-lt the settlement- 10     92.  Got another one! ANGLE: JAYNE is by a downed hovercraft. Inside are three skeletons: two grown-ups and a small child. Clothes in better condition, and again no sign of violence.  They's all just sittin'. Didn't crash... ANGLE: RIVER is quietly becoming more and more upset. CLOSE ON: KAYLEE walks in front of an office building, staying away from the cars as she hears:  Couple more here... 0 0 orpse _of_aman is pressed up against the glass wall right behind her. Mouth open, skin dead blue, terribly skinny... a thing to haunt. 14     93.  How come they're preserved?     She's right! Everybody's dead! This whole world is dead for no reason!      My grandma always told me: if you can't do something smart, do something right. By way of emphasis he loudly cocks his big-ass rifle. Mal takes in the fact that Jayne has spoken for them all.        Go! The entire crew piles out, all heavily bedecked with weapons.   Move those crates back there for cover -- and make sure they ain't filled with anything goes boom.  Move the gorram crates! Come on! We hear savage SCREAMS from the hanger -- they're approaching. Mal moves to the door, Jayne beside him.  Captain's right. Can't be thinking on revenge if we're gonna get through this.  I might...  She picked a sweet bung of a time to go helpless on us.  Zoe... Gorramnit... But she is in a trance, and we see beneath the calm, to the bubbling magma of rage that keeps her firing, single shots, each one a kill, till five men down and she's out of ammo. The sixth comes at her swinging a blade and she blocks, the precision of military training still in her as she flips him, wresting the blade free and swinging it down out of frame, bringing it up bloody, swinging again as the door bursts open and she's rushed from behind --- moving forward himself --     Oh, now you're likin' guns, huh? Cheaters! He takes a hit in the shoulder, grimaces and keeps firing. River watches, the gun limp in her hand. Kaylee grabs it and starts another round -- but she's peppered with dart-like projectiles. She screams and drops the weapon, pulling the projectiles from her -- Inara helps her up, pulls her back as Zoe shouts:  Very last one... He tosses it through the hole. Zoe doesn't even flinch from the blast as she thinks.  We got three full cartridges and my swingin' cod. That's all. Inara is by the elevator, pounding for it to come.--- 40     114.  You suppose he got through? Think Mal got the word out?",

        "Caron": "-- just a few of the images we've recorded, and you can see it isn't.. it isn't what we thought. There's been no war here, and no terraforming event. The environment is stable. It's the Pax, the G-32 Paxilon Hydroclorate that we added to the air processors. It's...  .well it works... it was supposed to calm the population, weed out aggression. Make a peaceful... it worked. The people here stopped fighting. And then they stopped everything else. They stopped going to work, stopped breeding... talking... eating...  There's thirty million people here and they all just let themselves die. They didn't even kill themselves. They just... most starved. When they stopped working the power grids, there were overloads, fires -- people burned to death sitting in their V0 chairs. Just sitting. There is a loud bang somewhere behind her -- she starts, gathers herself.         they've killed most of us... not just killed, they've done... things.  I won't live to report this, and we haven't got power to... people have to know...  We meant it for the best... to make people safer... to... God! She whirls, grabs a gun and fires -- then aims the gun at her bites her face -- She screams continuously as the Reaver tops her, biting at her and tearing at her clothes, at her skin.  These are some of the first sites we scouted on Miranda. There is no one living on this planet. There is no one... Mal hits the controls and a ramp extends towards the other side. He begins to cross. Never even looks back. On the Operative, trapped, watching in growing horror...",

Yeah well if she doesn't give us some extra flow from the engine room to offset the burnthrough this landing is gonna get pretty interesting.   \"Oh god, oh god, we're all gonna die?\"  I'm doing it! It's not enough.  Kaylee!  That part'll happen, pretty definitely.  We're moments from air. You got somebody behind you? We intercut Wash and Zoe at this point:     Just keep moving, honey. We're coming to you.   Get some distance on 'em. You come to the flats, I want you to swing round. Gonna try a Barn Swallow.  J Simon! Open the loading dock!   Okay, baby, we've talked this through...  Don't slow down!     31.  We all here? What's going on? Hello? r./ ZOE  No casualties. Anybody following?  Nice flying, baby, and that's a negative. Clean getaway -- Out of atmo in six minutes.  Those are my two favorite words!  Honey... \"Meal...\"     Start with the part where Jayne gets knocked out by a ninety pound girl. 'Cause I don't think that's ever getting old.  Can I make a suggestion that doesn't involve violence, or is this the wrong crowd?  V0 Fanty and Mingo might be coming hard down on us, or the laws... or maybe nobody could be bunged about a little social brawl. We need to get our bearings. I think we need to talk to Mr. Universe.  That's what we're looking to learn. Is there any follow up, a newswave... 4     53.  The oaty bar?   Mal! You up? Got a wave. I'm a bounce it down to you. He pops up, turns to the screen as the white noise becomes: 1400     62.  Inara. Nice to see her again.  Yeah, but, remember the part where it's a trap?  We're about seventy miles from the Training house. And nobody on radar... if the Alliance is about, they're laying low.  Do we care? Are we caring about that?  Nobody besides Jayne is saying that.  But there's nothing about it on the Cortex -- History, Astronomy... it's not in there.  Whoah, no, no --  Honey...  Show them the bad... She hits some commands on the screen, pulls back to reveal a couple of other planets near Miranda.  They just float out there, sending out raiding parties --  I'm on board with the run and hide       Yeah, but no power, either.  Wait. Something. Might be a beacon, but it's awful weak.  Let's get to the beacon.     Still got the Reavers, and probably the Alliance between us and him.   I am a leaf on the wind, watch how I soar.     We're fried! I got no control!  I'm gonna have to glide her in! 40     104.  140 Long as that landing strip is made of fluffy pillows...  I am a leaf on the wind. Watch -- A massive harpoon CRASHES through the windshield and impales him to his chair. It's as thick around as a telephone pole. Wash has time to open his mouth in surprise before he is dead.  She moves to him -- 40     105.",
        "Mathias": "Let's amp it up. Delcium, eight- drop. DOCTOR MATHIAS is not instantly likable -- nor gradually, for that matter. A cold man, and more than a little satisfied with himself.     4.

Her mental capacity is extraordinary, even with the side-effects.  Well, obviously, she's unstable... the neural stripping gives them heightened cognitive reception, but it also destabilizes their own reality matrix.

He smiles as they come out to meet him:     Look in my eyes, Lord, and my sins will play out on them as on a screen. Read them all. 4     58.  Forgive what you can, and send me on my path. I will walk on, until you bid me rest.   It's prayer for the dead.  It's for the men River might have killed in that bar.  You got a plan?  It'll do you for a spell, and the folks here'll be glad of the extra coin...  You won't.  This isn't a palms-up military MW run, Mal. No reports broadwaved, no warrants... much as they want her, they want her hid. That means Closed File. Means an Operative, which is trouble you've not known.  Not your way, Mal.  You can play the thug all you want, but there's more to you than you're ever like to 'fess.  Only one thing is gonna walk you through this, Mal. Belief.  When I talk about belief, why do you always assume I'm talking about God?  It's how they think: sideways. It's how they move. Sidle up and smile, hit you where you're weak.  Sorta man they're like to send believes hard. Kills and never asks why.  I wasn't born a Shepherd, Mal.   No I don't. He walks away, offering this:           Won't go far...  That crossed my mind.  I shot him down --  I killed the ship... that killed us. Not... very Christian of me.   Coming from you, that means... almost nothing... HNAAH! Ah, I'm long gone...  Can't... order me around, boy. I'm not one of your crew.  You... it's on you now... all this death, this shit... you have to find a course. This can't mean nothing. River... you have to...  I don't care what you believe!

They'll be back 'fore you can spit.  Not that you spit...     22. Kaylee watches him go, a tad forlorn.  Are you okay?  Well let's not do anything hasty...  We gotta have records of everything. A bona fide Companion entertained clients on this very ship! In this very bed! The picture pans over to the bed -- which River is bending over and sniffing curiously. Inara is packing things up.     Honest, Inara, why do you have to leave? Inara shoots an uncertain look at the camera -- and the picture freezes, goes back to the beginning. During all this, Mal has picked it up. He looks at it a moment, tosses it aside. Looks around at nothing much.  Shepherd Book said they was men that reached the edge of space., saw a vasty nothingness and just went bibbledy over it.  I don't know. People get awful lonely in the black. Like to get addlepated ourselves, we stay on this boat much longer. Captain'll drive us all off, one by one.  That ain't even so! River's a dear heart and a boon to this crew! You just don't like her 'cause she can read your mind and everything you think is mean.  Her and Simon could have a place here. Now they're leaving us. Just like Shepherd Book. She looks up toward one of the shuttles.     Don't talk to the barkers -- only the captains.  You look the captain in the eye, know who you're dealing with.  You shouldn't aughta be so clean. It's a dead giveaway you don't belong, you always gotta be tidy. Don't pay anybody in advance. And don't ride in anything with a Capissen 38 engine, they fall right out of the sky.  It is entirely and for all your fault! If you'd given Simon a moment, just a moment where he didn't think you were gonna throw them off or turn them in, he might've --  (as they continue  But he coulda made 'em family!

If you had a care for anybody's heart you woulda --  Tell that to Inara. For a moment, Mal is too shocked to react. Kaylee storms out.  Haven? We're gonna see Shepherd Book?  Not sure I get it.  We couldn't leave them now...  Oh they're so pathetic!  How can you be sure Inara don't just wanna see you? Sometimes people have feelings -- I'm referring here to people...  Yes.  No.  Nobody's saying that.  Cap'n! She tosses him a bolt remover. He starts pulling a bolt out of a panel on the wall, tells Zoe:  How can it be there's a whole planet called Miranda and none of us knowed that?   Wait a tick, yeah! Some ten years back, before the war. There was call for workers to settle on Miranda, my daddy talked about going. I should've recalled...  Shepherd? Shepherd Book! She stops, looking at the ground by the steeple. There is the body on the ground, face down. The child she played with at dinner. Kaylee stares, at first uncomprehending. ANGLE: MAL, moving in the other direction, approaches the cannon, Jayne behind him. He stops and sees: Book, lying by the cannon, torn up badly from the waist down.  What do you mean, the bodies...  These people are our friends --  GAAAAaaoh God -- -- and steps back, horrified, as the others approach. It's an office. About half the employees are there, in chairs or on the ground, all in the same state as the first fellow. We see ANGLES of the corpses as the gang evaluates...   What're they doing? What's everybody doing?  I can rig 'em so they won't re- open once they close.  Wait, Wash -- where's Wash? Nobody  realized he wasn't there. Zoe is dead calm. ,No ZOE He ain't comin'. Everybody takes that in, Kaylee's eyes welling up.  Oh, I didn't plan on going out like this. I think we did right, but...  With me? You mean to say, as, sex?  Hell with this. I'm gonna live. Simon looks at her a moment, then turns his attention to the door. Inara come up into frame with the contents of the oilcloth: a bow and arrow, which she pulls back with focused grace. ANGLE: THE DOOR starts to come off its hinges. 4     110.  Can close it... from outside...  I'm starting to lose some feeling here... I think there's something in them darts they throwed at me.",

There's no pattern to the pebbles here, they're completely random. I tried to count them but you drove too fast. Hummingbird.  Reavers.  They want us alive when they eat us.  I swallowed a bug. Kaylee runs in to see how everyone is. She goes to Simon.  He didn't lie down. They never lie down. She is looking at the Reaver. Everyone does, for a moment.  It's not safe.  For them.  Miranda. She turns and looks back at the crowd. What happens next happens very fast. quietly -- and she slams her foot into one's face, then whips kicks the table into a card player even as she sweeps a bottle off it behind her -- the bottle hits a man behind her square in the face, a man she never even looked at -- people are rising, fleeing or pushing forward --  They're afraid of me.  They should be. What I will show them... Oh God... She starts tearing up, breathing faster... Simon runs his hands through her hair.   Show me off like a dog, old men covered in blood, it never touched them but they're drowning in it... so much loss... I don't know what I'm saying. I never know what I'm saying...  Miranda.

Vao TEACHER River. Do as you're told. It's going to be fine. Lie down.     Miranda. WIt's a planet. Matches the one from her dream.   I had to show them. I didn't know if you were going to make me sleep.  , make them stop, they're everywhere, every city every house every room, they're all inside me, I can hear them all and they're saying nothing! GET UP! PLEASE, GET THEM UP! , please God make me a stone...  I'm all right. She looks at him, wet eyes full of clarity.     Based on our orbital trajectories, he reached optimum proximity just before our sunset. If we make a direct run within the hour we're only 67,332 miles out. At full burn we'd reach him inside of three- hours . 4     99. She doesn't notice the reactions to her sudden clarity -- she's still somewhat in her own world.  I can't shut them up...  They're all made up of rage. I can't... A BANG as a body slams against the door.  No. No. The lights go out. Everyone looks about them. Jayne fires again, but all the sound has bled out save these two. 4     115.  You won't. You take care of me, Simon. You've always taken care of me. She stands as the emergency lights come on, giving her face an unearthly glow as she looks down at him.     That's the plan.  I do. But I like to hear you say it.
