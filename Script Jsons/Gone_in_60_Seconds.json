And now he works the a hand saw, making critical cross-cuts on a wide panel of maple ... Atley Jackson is here as well ...

        "Calitri": "He wears an apron, protective glasses and a lopsided sneer. A Richard Widmark motherfucker - with the diamond hard look of a cobra. The liegelord of downtown...  And now he works the a hand saw, making critical cross-cuts on a wide panel of maple ... Atley Jackson is here as well ... As noisy as it is out in the yard, in here, once the door is closed, it's as SILENT-as a tomb...  A BANK OF MONITORS on one wall show the cars being crushed and disassembled in the yard. Memphis is led into the room.  Calitri nods and Dog-face leaves the room... Calitri smiles ... Examines his fresh cut...   Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?   So. What do we owe the honor -- ?   Yes ... Kip ...  He says the name like other men say \"cancer.\" The phone on his desk BLINKS. Calitri picks it up. Listens. Looks at one of the monitors. Where the Mexican man is talking to several Calitri EMPLOYEES. Calitri hangs up...   Excuse me one moment, Randall ...  And he picks up a MORTISE CHISEL on his way out. Palming it ...   You bring this to me in this condition? Blood and guts all over it? You make me complicit? On my property? Who taught you how to think? And worst of all: weren't there supposed to be two Hondas?   Stupid sonuvabitch...    Memphis can-see this from one of the monitors. He looks at Atley...   Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.   I'm proud of this work. The bird feeder. The wagon wheel planter. The dollhouse. The drop-leaf movable server...  He gestures to each item - exquisitely-rendered woodwork. Then gestures to the yard...   Metal. Steel. It's cold. Ugly. Wood is warm. Clean. Provided by nature. To see a piece of furniture take shape. It's like watching a child grow ...  Memphis glances to Atley... Atley shrugs ...   My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...   Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ...  Memphis nods, notes a PISTOL, resting on a shelf nearby.   No, no. You don't kill me, because you can't. You don't take your brother and run, because we'd find him. You don't go to the-police, because we have friends there, too. You do nothing: except deal with me.  Memphis eyes him...   Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...  Calitri takes a manila ENVELOPE from his desk... Hands it to Memphis, who takes out the SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER inside.   On that list, you'll find fifty cars. Fifty. Five-zero. They range in age from the 1956 Ford Thunderbird to the 1999 Toyota Camry; and in expense from the 1993 Volkswagen Jetta to the 1988 Lamborghini Countach. Fifty cars. Five-zero.  Memphis scans the list ... Looks up at Calitri ...   There is a container ship in Long Beach Harbor. Pier 14. Ready to be loaded with 4-car-per shipping containers, false-walled and customsprofiled as motor oil designated. The ship leaves in four days for South America and the men who've tendered me this contract ...   They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...  Memphis scans the list ...   Four days. 50 cars. I'm paying 200 thousand dollars ...  Now Memphis looks up...   I knew you'd say that.   I knew you'd say that, too --  Calitri smiles ... Memphis 'looks at him... At Atley Realizing the trap ...   Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...   I made this, too. My first one. Brass extension handles, not plated. The coverings are silk, not rayon. Expensive hardwood. And lined with spray green Lorraine crepe ...  Memphis waits, knowing where this is going --   Yes, yes. I made it for young Kip. In case he fails. At 8:00 Friday morning, if that ship sets off without my fifty ... Kip will take up permanent residence in this box ...  Calitri WALL SWITCH and the a corrugated steel SLIDING DOOR is RAISED, revealing a LOADING DOCK facing the back of the yard... Two MEN are working out there... DIGGER AND BUTZ scuzzy dudes, mid-30s and dressed in dirty coveralls ...   Come here for a second, boys --  And they come over --   Digger, Butz: let me introduce you to Randall Raines. Used to head up the dandiest ring in Southern Cal. Left us for parts unknown. Randall, this is Digger. And that's Butz -   Digger and Butz will be in charge of burial. They're good boys ...  Memphis' look is cold and furious ... Plaintive:   \"don't want\" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...  Atley hits the wall-switch and the steel door slides shut. Calitri turns to Memphis...   \"Nothing that's forced can ever be right.\" Old woodworking expression. I really don't care how the 50 get onto my ship ... I just care that they do. You decide.  With that, he puts his protective glasses back on - and fires up an abrasive-disc-finishing machine, adjusting the miter gage and beginning to sand the Outside curve of an angled chamfer.   Hello, Kip --  Kip tries to get out. The doors are pinned by the forklift.   Were it only that easy --   No you can't. Flies on sherbert is what you remind me of. Because just being attracted to something, doesn't mean you belong...    Atley is here, watching Calitri and Kip. one of the monitors. He's miserable. But there is nothing he can do.   Call me \"Ray.\" Better yet: call me \"asshole.\" Cos that's how you've treated me --   This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?   Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ...   Hello, Otto. My boys at the dock report no cars have yet to be delivered. And there's only one more night ...   With all the free time I've had not counting cars as they're loaded onto my ship, I've managed to sand the cedar inside your box, Kip. This will protect you from the anaerobic bacteria, that normally thrives in an airless; environment. Thus prolonging decay ...  He smiles ... And Kip actually makes a run for him... Only to be held back by Tumbler and Donny ...   One more night --   I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...  And with that, he leaves, his goons following. Leaving our  crew to stare after him ... And then we FADE TO BLACK...  As a SUPER on-screen reads PART III: SWITCHIN'-TO-GLIDE   Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...   Right there -  He gestures to a Haliburton case ... Memphis opens it ... There's a lot of cash inside...   200 K. Just like we said ...   But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --  Memphis looks at him... Calitri smiles ...   I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...  Calitri goes to the FAX machine... Tears off the sheet..   It's an easier take. 30 cars. Two weeks. Most of them SUVs. Going to Russia. Think Kip'll be interested?   Well, that certainly won't do.   Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...   Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ...  Memphis is by a TABLE SAW... He flicks it on. The electric MOTOR rumbles, so as to obfuscate, any noise in here ...   What are you doing -- ?    Memphis walks to the battered Eleanor ... As Pearl Jam's \"Rearviewmirror' crunches and a CAR comes motoring up to him. It's ANOTHER 167 SHELBY. ANOTHER ELEANOR, a \"For Sale\" sign pasted on the back window. It's being driven by Kip...",
        "Donny": "Problem, Officer?   For running a stop sign?   Pull over! Pull her the hell over!  Jenny pulls the car over in a lopsided lurch...   Put it in PARK. Remember how to do that? It's the big \"Pff.  She parks it. He stabs at the side-view mirror ...   \"Objects May Appear Closer Than They Seem.\" Can you say that for me?   You ain't sorry. You're a horrible driver... You can't strap into your seat belt, without almost getting creamed by a bus ...  She starts to cry... Donny softens ...   Aw, c'mon. It's no big deal. You can't drive. You can't. Time to acknowledge it and move on. I can't swim. I know I can't. So you know what I do? I stay the fuck outta the pool ...   Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...   All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?   Most of 'em are gone. The Dyar Boys are doing a nickel at Chino; Henry Santoro and Frankie Fish are moving weight in Florida; Bill Doolin was killed in Denver... Atley Jackson's on the gimp and runnin' errands for Calitri; The Sphinx is still around, I guess ... Then of course, there's ...  His pause is meaningful ...   Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?   Most of 'em are late-model...   We'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live...  Otto enters. Giggles...   A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..   Yeah...   Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?   Lookit Kip. All grown up...   You guys have any skills at all?    What about him?   There's no one left ...    We sent him out on a solo boost. See what he could do ...  Freb pulls in an '89 Cadillac Coupe De Ville ...   How'd it go?   Well, that defies the point, don't it?   Get the damn thing in there and get it cleaned up -  Freb pulls in. Pops the trunk. The gate is closed.   Lemme see that -  He pierces the skin.. Tastes ...   Heroin.   There's gotta be a million bucks worth here -   Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.   Car-jacking is the lazy man's boost. No skill. No finesse. Can only take the car if the key is in it. That's not thieving. That's parking ... Thugs ... With the decency of dirt ...   Eleanor is Memphis' \"unicorn.\"   Grade-A unicorn ...   Fabled creature. You know - the horse with the horn? Impossible to capture?  Toby looks blank ...   We all got one. The single car that, no matter how many times you try to boost, something happens... Cops show up, car doesn't start, owner comes back. It's voodoo...   You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -   On boost night? Always take along a good mix tape ...  Donny smiles ... Freb frowns ...   You bring a woman back to your crib for some lovemaking, the song you put on, depends on the woman, the type of lovemaking you intend to do, right?   You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.   It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?   Good.  And then Sway enters ... Donny gets out of the Caddy ...   Whoa, whoa, whoa. Memphis went out and got some big game ... Hello, Sway. I was just telling the lads about mix tapes --   Gender bias ...  Otto is before her ... Bowing from the waist ...   What do you think about all this?   That's my girl --   Well, well, well. The original crash test dummy...  The Sphinx nods to all. Smiles warmly, but it comes out creepy. Freb whispers to Otto ...   It's arright ...  They drive on ... Till --   Check it out: 173 Firebird. Know who drove one of those ... ?   That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?   For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...   What color?   You ever notice how it had a different interior every week? That bugged me.   I'd like the names and addresses of the owners of these 20 cars please...   I can wait.  He smiles kindly at her. And takes a seat. It's that easy.   Thomas Sullivan Magnum, to be exact.  They look at Donny, impressed...   Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...   Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..   I think so too --  And they drive... All smiles ... All pleased with themselves ... And, after a beat ...   What are you doing?   The hell are you doing?   Big deal. Now what?   I miss Orville Redenbacher already --   Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?   That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...  He pops his briefcase ... Takes out some gear ... Gets out ... Moves for Diane 1 ...   What's the matter?   Yeah?  He holds up a screwdriver. Jams it in the steering column.   I don't care what kind of car it is. How fancy; how expensive; how new. You pop the collar - it's 1966 all over again ... !  He pops the collar - exposing an ordinary ignition system.   So? Tell me: how come they call you \"Freb\" anyways -- ?   We're partners here --  Freb considers ... Then, reluctantly --   Glad to know you, \"Freberick.\" Let's roll -  And off they go ...   Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...   No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!  And Donny puts her in gear, When a GUN is jammed agains't Donny's temple ...   Are you kidding me -- ?   I'm stealing this car. So BACK OFF!   Donny-nothin'!  And he SLAMS OPEN THE DOOR... catching the kid in the balls ... And the kid doubles over... Dropping the gun ... Donny gets out of the car...   Lazy, disrespectinIf half-assed bully. Any asshole can pull a gun ...  And he starts to kick at the kid ... Beat at him...   You don't know how to steal a car, do ya? So you gotta take them when there's already a key in them ... And a person in them... Scare people ... Intimidate ... Little freakin' bully ...   Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?  But then - BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Bullets rip into Donny Astricky in terrifying SLOW-MOTION. He turns ... To see another KID ... Scared... At the edge of the road... Gat held high ... And Donny drops to the pavement ... And the first Jacker gets to his feet...  Freb goes to Donny... To his splayed-out body ... SIRENS split the night. The jackers run off down the street.   Get outta here. Get out. Now!   I'm all right. Been shot before. You take me to the hospital, they bust the both of us. The cops'll take me. Go!  And Freb-makes to run off down the street... But --   Freb -- !  Freb turns back   Take Laura with you, you stupid shit!  Freb blinks. Nods. Oh, yeah. He climbs into the Bentley Drives off... As the CRUISERS pull up around him... And the UNIFORMS getout, guns drawn, approaching warily -  To find Donny Astricky ... Splayed-out on the pavement ... Laughing at the moon ... And, as Jimi Hendrix' \"Crosstown Traffic\" BLASTS ON TRACK, we CUT TO:  of the final series of boosts ...  1) The Maserati parked and empty. Sway breaches it. Expert. They drive off ...  2) Kip and Tumbler. Clocking a VIPER. They circle it.. It's loaded with bells and whistles and Clubs and a metallic voice that warns: \"WARNING: YOU ARE TOO CLOSE THE VEHICLE!\" over and over ... Kip shakes his head ... Ushers Tumbler back ...  3) Mirror Man and The Sphinx deliver an Aston Martin to the docks ... Watch as it is driven into a container. The container loaded by gantry crane, onto the ship, lashed to the deck by overworked",

The cook smiles from behind the order wheel ...   Come, come, come ...  And she leads him over to a booth ... Barking to the cook - RUBY - on the way...   Tuna melt on pumpernickel.  Provolone, extra tomato, Dijon... And a chocolate milk... Lots of syrup...  Right?   You look good...   What are you doing back?   Have you seen him?   oh.   Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?  He looks at her ... Beat ...   I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?   I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...   Of course ...  ANGLE - RUBY. He's on the PHONE in the kitchen...One eye on Memphis and Helen --     You haven't spoken to him in a while, I guess...   Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself  And, on her sad smile, we PRE-LAP Sammy Hagar's \"I Can't Drive 55\" and SLAM CUT TO:    A small New England-style shingle and clapboard, up on a hill overlooking the port. A small GUEST-HOUSE behind it ...    Helen clears away the dinner dishes ... The TV is on. The news. We see a CRIME SCENE ...    Memphis is at the kitchen table. The list of cars before him. He's making notations. He gets to his feet ... He goes to check on his mother ... She's asleep in her room... He closes the door ...  And goes back to the kitchen. He goes to a framed PHOTOGRAPH - of he and Kip. Earlier times. Happier times.  When there is an enormous THUD! From outside. Memphis goes to a window. Sees a RAMP TRUCK unloading a gnarled blob of metal. Memphis runs outside. Just as the ramp truck drives off ...  Memphis goes to the mangled Trans Am... Leans down ... And there's Kip ... Seriously smooshed in the flattened car.   The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...   Tuesdays ...  He smiles ... Sits down next to her ... They go through the  PHOTOS: - childhood shots of Memphis and Kip, a younger Helen; Memphis at 17, in his \"Ike's Garage\" coveralls; 14year-old Memphis, an infant Kip, and their father  a MAN with bright eyes and a quiet smile, standing before an old Cutlass 442; Robert Raines ... Outside a car dealership. We can almost feel his strong, sure presence ...  Memphis looks at his mother ... As she looks at the picture.   Every day. I wonder about that every day...    And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...   I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...   I know...    As Memphis goes through some old boxes. At last, he finds what he's looking for ... Opens it ... He takes out its contents ... His tools, which we remember from the opening ...

The cook smiles from behind the order wheel ...   Come, come, come ...  And she leads him over to a booth ... Barking to the cook - RUBY - on the way...   Tuna melt on pumpernickel.  Provolone, extra tomato, Dijon... And a chocolate milk... Lots of syrup...  Right?   You look good...   What are you doing back?   Have you seen him?   oh.   Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?  He looks at her ... Beat ...   I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?   I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...   Of course ...  ANGLE - RUBY. He's on the PHONE in the kitchen...One eye on Memphis and Helen --     You haven't spoken to him in a while, I guess...   Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself  And, on her sad smile, we PRE-LAP Sammy Hagar's \"I Can't Drive 55\" and SLAM CUT TO:    A small New England-style shingle and clapboard, up on a hill overlooking the port. A small GUEST-HOUSE behind it ...    Helen clears away the dinner dishes ... The TV is on. The news. We see a CRIME SCENE ...    Memphis comes out ... Moves to the sedan parked across the street ... it is Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff...    Memphis is at the kitchen table. The list of cars before him. He's making notations. He gets to his feet ... He goes to check on his mother ... She's asleep in her room... He closes the door ...  And goes back to the kitchen. He goes to a framed PHOTOGRAPH - of he and Kip. Earlier times. Happier times.  When there is an enormous THUD! From outside. Memphis goes to a window. Sees a RAMP TRUCK unloading a gnarled blob of metal. Memphis runs outside. Just as the ramp truck drives off ...  Memphis goes to the mangled Trans Am... Leans down ... And there's Kip ... Seriously smooshed in the flattened car.    Kip is in front of the TV, playing a video game. Helen Raines is at the kitchen table, going through a PHOTO ALBUM... Memphis comes home ... Hangs up his coat ...   The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...   Tuesdays ...  He smiles ... Sits down next to her ... They go through the  PHOTOS: - childhood shots of Memphis and Kip, a younger Helen; Memphis at 17, in his \"Ike's Garage\" coveralls; 14year-old Memphis, an infant Kip, and their father  a MAN with bright eyes and a quiet smile, standing before an old Cutlass 442; Robert Raines ... Outside a car dealership. We can almost feel his strong, sure presence ...  Memphis looks at his mother ... As she looks at the picture.   Every day. I wonder about that every day...    And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...   I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...   I know...    As Memphis goes through some old boxes. At last, he finds what he's looking for ... Opens it ... He takes out its contents ... His tools, which we remember from the opening ... And then...   Helen Raines is rooting through a crowded closet. At last she finds what she's looking for ... A small black boxy DEVICE. She goes to the living room. Plugs in the box ...  It is a POLICE SCANNER... And it immediately starts to pop and caw ... Helen sits down ... And listens... Her face clenched with worry ...    Another few beats of silence ... Everyone watching ... He punches the gas... Ripping down to the accident site... Heading straight for it ... And we fear he aims to smash the site, maybe further injure the accident victims -  Not our Memphis ... He's heading straight for",
        "Otto": "The hustle and bustle of a full-service auto restoration operation ...  Dig the 157 Chevy, as an orange diamond tuck and roll with orange fur interior is installed... Dig the 153 Corvette as its front and rear suspension is replaced with coils and airshocks ... Dig the 150 Merc, as its chrome is stripped off and the old paint sandblasted and holes brazed...  All under the watchful eye of...    Late 60s. A feisty grease-soaked curmudgeon who begs the question: how the hell did they manage to rock together Yoda and the ghost of Walter Huston... ?  But he remains the Zen master of cars and all that cars are, were and can be ...  His mixed-breed MUTT - Hemi - licks his balls in one corner  Otto is currently AIRBRUSHING a candy-colored, variegated DESIGN on the deck lid of a Camaro ... It is painstaking work ... But he is an artist ...  His woman - JUNIE - a tall blonde, early 40s, body of a thousand dances, wipes his brow, like a scrub nurse ...  Memphis wanders in...  Otto sees Memphis ... Drops his brush... He walks over to Memphis ... Takes him in his arms ... Hugs him close... Actually waltzes him a few steps ...  Memphis is stunned at the transformation this place has gone through ...   Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?   You remember Junie?   Whatever do you mean?   What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...  He calls over to the MEXICAN MAN working on the pick-up ...   It's 3 coats of primer, 12 coats of black acrylic lacquer before laying out the flames ... And fill the cab top with mylar flakes ... They'll sparkle like stars ...  Randall, Randall, Randall ... You look splendid ...   I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...   I can't concentrate. Play something, my sweetness; my reason to rise ...  And Junie hits PLAY on a cassette deck ... And, instantly, ENGINE SOUNDS rip from the shop's stereo speakers ... Otto listens, as if it were a Mahler symphony...   The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. At Le Mans. 1971. The quad-cam V12. Hear how they got the engine up? Hear those exhaust notes? That's a very wide rev range... Here, it peaks at 5500 RPM...  Memphis smiles ... These eccentricities are old hat...   Raymond Calitri. He's amplified much sorrow on these streets ...   Are you considering a comeback tour?   It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...   \"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them...\" Nietzsche said that.   The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -   I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...   Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...  And he closes his eyes ... To listen to the Ferrari tape ...   ... 8.8:1 compression...  We PRE-LAP Simon And Garfunkel's \"Baby Driver\" and CUT TO:    In a wood-panelled back room, around a conference table: Memphis and Donny sit... With the list before them...   Some crew you got ...   Dignity...   You need him...   I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...   The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be.  Memphis considers ... He has little choice ...   In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...   We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...   We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...  Memphis looks at him. Because that's what he was afraid of.    Memphis, Kip, Donny, Mirror Man and Otto sit around the garage ... Going through the list ... Tumbler calls from the next room:   Who is it -- ?   one minute -- !  And the others scatter into the back office, with their tools and devices and lists. Leaving only Memphis and Otto.  Memphis picks up the broken bag ... Sticks it in the trunk ... Puts the golf clubs in on top of it ... Slams the trunk. Only there's still a neat MOUNTAIN OF SMACK ON THE FLOOR by the rear of the Caddy ... But there's no time...  For the gate is opened. Detective Castlebeck ambles in.   Cadillac.  ANGLE - the mound of heroin on the floor ...   Needs brightening ...  Castlebeck takes out a WALKIE ... Barks into it ...   No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?   Double-meaning intended, right?

They stand before a locked MAZDA.   We're dinosaurs, Donny. Pull-up a tar pit ...  Can I try -- ?   I've missed you, Sara Wayland --   That's The Sphinx.   He never says a word. And he's got a messed-up nose. Hence. The Sphinx. He's boo-koo koo-koo. But he steals like time ...  Hello, Sphinxy, old rum -- !  And Otto embraces the taller man ... And the others stand around, offering uneasy glances to The Sphinx ...   Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...    Sway has drawn an intricate CHART on a vinyl DRAWING BOARD: 1-50, each car is annotated, ie: 1) '56 Ford T-Bird; 2) 188 Lamborghini Countach, etc. She begins ascribing names to them, Female names. With Magic Marker. Easy to erase.    Sway writes #2-4) Porsche Boxster and next to it PATRICIA 1     Memphis and Otto go through Otto's BIBLE - an overstuffed LEDGER with the addresses Otto has collected, over the years, of some 2000 cars. They look for any that correspond to Calitri's 50 ...    Sway at the board... A grouping of three Mercedes Benz S320 are designated as JENNIFER 1, JENNIFER 2, JENNIFER 3...    Otto shows Freb how to disarm an alarm system by groundingout a tail-light with a wire to a mini-battery...  This dead-shorts the lights, shorts-out the alarm system, which chirps for a sustained second and then kills itself. The door locks pop open ... Otto grins...   Yes, but what was on the license plate?   Very good. But what was the significance of \"ROBIN 1\"?   His first name was Thomas. Thomas Magnum...    Sway calls #29 - A '98 Corvette - CAROL...    Tumbler and Kip park the car carrier behind a Matterhorn of decimated automobiles ... Out of view...    Sway writes NANCY 1 next to #27) BMW M ROADSTER...   Anyone? The significance of \"Robin 1\" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?   Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?   Here's where it gets tricky ...   That's a good one, Donny...    Sway has finished the chart ... 50 cars ... Their corresponding distaff names...    The Replacements chime in with \"Someone Take The Wheel.\" Memphis and the crew ... All but Sway are present.  Tumbler and Mirror Man follow Memphis to one side of the shop ... To a window ... He gestures outside to where we see and UNMARKED CAR and the orange glow of two cigarettes ... Staking them out ...    To a safe and successful session of bumping fenders and trading paint.  Everyone toasts ... Drinks ... Donny goes to the tape deck... Hits PLAY ... And \"Little Deuce Coupe\" by The Beach Boys BLASTS.   And all of our guys dance to it ... Singing along ... Otto dances with Junie; Tumbler with Toby; even The Sphinx lipsyncs the falsetto parts ...   So saith the God of Scumbags --   Getting nervous, Ray? What happens to you, I wonder, if delivery isn't made?  Calitri ignores him... Looks at Kip ...    Drycoff and Hawkings wait in their unmarked ...    Mirror Man and Tumbler are at the window Memphis brought them to last night ... Mirror Man has a RADIO TRANSMITTER in his hand... Donny comes by ...    Freb on this end... He hangs up ...    They all wait, anxious ... Dressed for their night ... And then Memphis enters ... Hoots and hollers ...  He's dressed in the old duds. Black turtleneck. Black boots. Black pants. Long, black, leather duster. Way too cool for school. Memphis Raines returns...    As the crew get into the van... And drive-off ...    Otto stands before The Big Board - with all the ladies' names on it ... On the two-way ...   Ready to start erasing. Good luck, kiddies --    As Otto SWIPES NAMES FROM THE BOARD...    as the four corresponding names are ERASED...    Junie, Otto's gal, on the telephone...   You guys are through...   \"Carol.\" A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...   It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...    The gang is watching on the TV... Freaking out ... ANGLE - KIP. He slips out of the place. No one's noticed him go...    Otto, The Sphinx, Tumbler, Freb and Mirror Man are sipping coffee and eating donuts ... They are exhausted... Memphis and Kip pull up in Eleanor... He hands Otto the briefcase. Otto opens it... All that cash...   He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.   She left...  He nods ...

Has The Boss Barracuda been grounded -- ?  Memphis takes out his cell phone ... Dials...   Hello -- ?   Is this The Boss Barracuda -- ?   How you doing, man -- ?   You got it, brother.

Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.   I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between \"FRIENDS\" and \"SEINFELD\"...  Memphis nods ... Fairly impressed...   What about me?   How come ... ?   Come on. Kip, talk to the guy   Department of Water and Power. Could you hold please ...  And before the Judge can respond, they've clicked him on hold... And they make him wait ... And wait ... Just like the real D.W.P. does ... They high-five...   Where should we put him?   D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?   Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?   okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...   I know, sir ...  And Kip pantomimes eating. Toby, at first puzzled, gets it.   For the inconvenience we're also offering a free breakfast brunch --   Yes, sir -  Pause ... They've got him... Thumbs-up ...   You've been pre-booked...  And the Judge hangs up ...   Goodbye to you, too, assface ...   You sure I can't go with ya?  Memphis' ice-water glance is answer enough ...   I dunno ...  And Kip gets on the two-way...   I never been to the suburbs ...  Toby is there ... Having stowed-away...   Checkin' it out  He smiles at Kip ... Kip looks at Tumbler ... Drives ... At last, pulling up to one HOUSE where the '98 Benz - \"'Carol\" lives. Kip parks, a half block down ... They get out ... Head for the house...  And there she is. \"Carol.\" Obsidian black. In the garage. The garage is open. And THREE KIDS, two boys and a girl. Late teens. They are standing around \"Carol\"... Drinking beer... Listening to the new Beck album on the car's CD player ... The folks clearly out of town ...  Well-scrubbed, white suburban children of plenty ... The only crew they've ever run in is J. Crew... From the hedge, Kip, Tumbler and Toby watch the kids ... With equal parts fascination, loathing, envy... And then, the kids go inside... Leaving \"Carol\" exposed...   I got this one...  And before the others can respond, he moves for her. And she's open... Toby's in ... Butterfly popped - Gizmo in. The others start to get in when ONE OF THE KIDS comes out from the house. He stares at Toby, who freezes mid-boost ...   Which way's out, man -- ?   What am I supposed to do?  Toby pins the gas. Straight at the block... The security cops dive out of the way. Except for one standing tall and FIRING into the windshield... Into Toby... The car swerves. Going off the road. Into a bank of mailboxes.  The security guards run for her... Kip, forehead bloodied, switches places with Toby, getting behind the wheel ... Punches the gas ... Getting them out of there ...   Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...   Kip. Kip. Kip. Tell me: what's gonna happen? What's gonna happen?  But Kip is lost ... Doesn't know what to say --   No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?  The brothers stare at the boy... Kip wipes his sweatstreaked face...   What's gonna happen? I don't feel ... like ... this ... should.... happen ... right ... now. I...haven't... done ... shit... Tears running down his eyes...   Kip... Kip... Kip... It doesn't feel... It doesn't feel... It doesn't feel... good  He looks up at Kip. All of the light goes out of his eyes. And Toby is dead... Kip holds him for a beat ... Then passes him to a surprisingly emotional Tumbler ... Kip gets out of the car, runs for the opposite end of the warehouse ...  The others are stunned... Mirror Man hangs up the phone ... Memphis gets out of the car ... He goes after Kip ... Finds him in one of the containers ... Grabs him by the collars ...",

        "Freb": "The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --   That -- ?   How are we supposed to--   What's the point, man -- ?   Any word, Kip -- ?   What does that mean -- ?   But we only got till Friday. That's four days. And we lost the 13. So's we gotta start over ...  Kip looks at him...   Memphis. Holy shit. It's an honor, man --  And he pumps his hand... Memphis continues to stare at Kip   What are you doing back, Memphis?   Izzat true? You come back to save our bacon?   We don't -- ?   People gotta eat ...  Memphis looks at all of them ... Sighs...   How do I look in this one?   Keys were in it ...   Shaddup, man ...   In front of one of them poker parlors in Chinatown ...   It just ain't happening --   What's that?  Donny smiles ...   I guess ...   okay ...    Got it ...   Who's that -- ?   The Sphinx?   How you know that?   Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?   Was that his first name?   Thank-God, Sway, you ain't all freaky- deaky, too  But Sway grins    Freb is at his stereo.

My names \"Fred.\" You know: Frederick? One drunk night, I decided to give myself a tattoo. Hot needle it. I used a mirror to guide me ...  And he pulls up his sleeve - to show the blue \"FREB\" tattooed there ...   The mirror messed me up with the \"b\" and the \"d\"... Everything's reversed, you know? Now, I'm \"Freb.\"  Donny chooses from a selection of IGNITIONS he's brought along. Finds the right one ... Installs it ... Tightens the 3 screws ... Starts the car with his own key ...   You ever feel bad about any of this?   You mean the poor --   Donny --   C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --   I can't leave you here, man --  Freb doesn't know what to do... Donny croaks ...   You spoke  The Sphinx shrugs...",
        "Memphis": "You know my back -   How's Atley -- ?   Let them go --   Let them go. And I'll leave ...   You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...   You have my word...   You know what you got here?   There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?   You have any other answers besides \"not really\"?   Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ?  Tom starts to say \"not really\". Instead, he nods. Memphis takes a root beer from an old-style machine. He goes out ... front ... To where an old Denver Pyle-coot - BUDGY - sits on a bench, smoking an unfiltered Lucky ... Memphis sits beside him, pets the 200-year-old DOG that lounges nearby...    Those things'll kill ya, Budgy --   1980 Mercury Cougar. 255 cubic inch V8 ... Based on the Ford Thunderbird bodyshell; they modified the chassis, but didn't improve its performance...  Budgy points at another car ... And we get the sense they play this game every day...   The 1970 Plymouth Road Runner. Proof positive of a single all-powerful Deity. The first bargain-priced muscle car ever. They even tuned the horn to resemble the \"beep beep\" sound of the cartoon Road Runner ...  And Budgy looks impressed... As always ...   That I did, Budgy. That I did --  And, from inside the garage, there's the most horrific GRIND of metal on metal, as Tom has started the Plymouth -   Excuse me --  Memphis goes back into the garage, Budgy cackles.   What's going on -- ?  And standing there, by the Mercedes, like a wraith, is ATLEY JACKSON, in long leather coat, smoking a cigarette ... As out of place here as a maggot on a muffin...   Hello, Atley ...   How's the leg?   What are you doing here?   What about?   Thanks, Donna --  She leaves... Atley is staring at him... Memphis shrugs...   Six years ...   Tell me about Kip -  Atley takes a sip of his beer,...   What kind of job... ?   A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?  Atley frowns ... Looks at him...   It seems she neglected to mention it   Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...   Who was the job for?   Who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna melt in this joint -- ?  And she turns around to see Memphis standing there. Her expression displays many things ... Most of them joy ...   Hello, Ma --  And she goes to Memphis ... Wraps her arms around him ... Squeezes tight ...   How ya doing, Ruby -- ?   Right ...  And they settle in ... Across the booth from each other ... She takes his hands...   You, too, Ma...   How's Kip?  And Helen flushes, a bit ashamed maybe ...   No.   Atley Jackson came to see me ...   Why didn't you tell me?   He's in some trouble ...   You getting my checks ... ?     He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...   Hey, Kip ...   That's right...   You, too  Hold the stare... The others are excited...   Little visit. Check on the family.   Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up   He give you an advance -- ?   You just give 'im back the money. All's well...  The others look glum... Kip laughs ... Long and hard...   You listen to me, baby brother. You fancy yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum, well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a poundcake. But I remember the days when you used to steal my Colorforms and eat 'em... So you can't stop me from saving your \"dangling ass' if that's what I feel like doing...  And with that, he shoves Kip back down into his seat, toppling the table, bottles and glasses crashing... And barrels away from them, the crowd parting like a wound...  Kip's crew left stunned, flustered, and maybe a bit impressed...   Randall Raines to see Mr. Calitri ...   How ya doing?   It's about my brother ... Kip...   Jesus ...   I don't want him hurt...  Calitri looks at him, then waves a hand around the shop...   I'm sure you're working your way to the point.  I'll wait right here ...  Calitri blinks. Smiles. Nods...   I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...   I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...   They gave you only four days?   I'm not interested --   I'm just here about my brother.   Sound it out for me.   And if he doesn't make it -- ?  Calitri goes to one corner of the shop... Takes a tarp off of a full couch MAHOGANY CASKET...   I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...   You know my back.  They get out of the car... The view of San Pedro from up here is a spectacular bedspread of lights ...   The other day....   No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...   Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...   Not at all ...  He and Castlebeck lock eyes ... Castlebeck takes a pear from his coat pocket ... Sets to polishing it ...   A little family emergency --   No...   Kip.   And this has what to do with me?   Kip -- ?   You all right -- ?   Just hold-on there --  Memphis goes to the garage ... Finds a crowbar, an acetylene TORCH, tin-snips ... He goes back to the wrecked car... And sets to work... He looks at Kip ... Shakes his head...   So you want to run that part by me again about things being \"all sweetness and light...\"   Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?   Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...  Indeed... Memphis has freed him ... Kip crawls from the wreckage ... His clothes in tatters... Blood seeps from a variety of contusions ... He limps ... Memphis helps him to the guest house ...   You okay -- ?   Sure --  And Kip limps toward the refrigerator ... He comes back with two beers ... Hands one to Memphis ... Glances at the TV --   You sure you're okay -- ?   Yeah -   Something like that -   Yeah --  Beat ... They watch the game ... Kip replaces the soaked towel with another ...   Maybe you need a stitch --   Okay --  Beat ...   What do you got ... ?  And Kip hoists himself painfully to his feet ... Limps over to the 'fridge ... Memphis watches him, a slight grin at Kip's attempt at cool ... Kip peers into the 'fridge ...   There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -   So what are you gonna do?   \"About what?\"   I can see that -  And Memphis glances out the window. To the crushed car. Kip catches the glance, glances himself, chooses to ignore it.   You have everything ... under control?   What happened to you?   You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...   \"Over--\"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--   He's gonna kill you -- !   You can handle it?   You can handle it?   You?   You?   You don't think so, huh?   What's with the fish thing -- ?   Fish.   Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of \"Karaoke.\"   You have a Hollandaise sauce ?   Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce   I think about that night a lot...   How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...  Nothing from Atley... They walk ... Memphis looks at him.   Yeah, you know: I just. I just never really thanked-you. I meant to. I just want you to know...  Memphis nods. Atley shrugs, and selects some halibut filets.   Tell him it's on ...  Atley looks at him...   Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on  Atley nods...   Hello, Otto ...   Of course. Hi, Junie --   What happened here -- ?   The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?   You, too, Otto  And Otto goes back to the Camaro ... To finish his work...   He's gotten involved --  Otto looks up frustrated... To Junie   You think it can be done?   Tell me...   The hard part ...   Is he still working here ?   I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me  Otto has finished the Camaro ... He looks at Memphis --   And the moral of that story is -- ?   How you doing, man?   You know where the others are?  Donny frowns... Looks close at Memphis ... Then:   Forget that ...   That's right. Only 10 exotics ...   If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?   Well, the three of us don't'exactly inspire confidence...  Beat ... Donny examines the list ...   I know. Weird, huh -- ?  The door opens ... One of Otto's WORKERS is there...   What are you doing here?   No we don't -   His criminal career has officially come to a close ...   We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean   You hear me?   How old are you now, Toby?   Okay, then... Otto?   You got maybe a better plan?  Tumbler looks to Kip...   \"Shadow games?\"   You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.  Kip and the others nod... Makes sense ...   Go on, Otto -   Yeah. He's knows of one all right.  So we'll PRE-LAP The Beach Boys' \"409\" and CUT TO:   See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --   The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...   You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?   Buy you a drink?   \"Mitch?\"   So I was replaced by Mitch?   Wow. And to think all I accomplished these past six years was the \"LORD OF THE RINGS\" trilogy...  She stares at him... Shakes her head... Busies herself with her glassware ... Beat ...   You look great --   On account of Mitch?   I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?   I left town. I didn't leave you.   And here I am...   Kip's in trouble  And now she looks concerned   Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.   Six or seven...   I understand -  And the cat - MITCH - comes over with two empty pitchers   I'd go so far as to say \"lovely.\"  And Mitch leans over to him, conspiratorially ...   Really?   What's it look like?  And Memphis reaches out, and GRABS Mitch's nipple, PINCHING. Mitch's face curls ...   Is it a squinty, grimacing, contorted face? Agonized and writhing and ugly? Oh, now I see it, yes, yes!  And Memphis releases him... And Mitch goes down hard ... And Sway comes over ...   If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...  And he's out of there, before Mitch's PALS can get to him.   Where'd you pick her up?   Well, take it back --   Take it back, Freb --   You know my back.   Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.  Castlebeck looks at Otto... Otto grins... Castlebeck walks around the garage... Taking it all in...  Castlebeck notes the Caddy ...   You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?   Let her rip ...  And Castlebeck starts the car...  ANGLE - TAILPIPE ... WHOOSH! All of the heroin on the flo is blown away by the exhaust ... Memphis winks to Otto ... Castlebeck seems satisfied ... Gets out.   I don't think so, Detective ...  And Castlebeck is gone. Memphis and Otto exhale big time.. The others come out from the back... To find Memphis and Otto dumping the heroin into the sink, running the tap ...   Take her back to where you found her, Freb --   Hey -  He kisses her head ...   Kip -  Kip nods ... Plays on ...   What do you got there?   What time of year?   You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?   Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership...  Imagine us selling cars?  Nothing from Kip ... Eyes glued to the TV... Memphis glances to his Mother ...   Imagine that -- ?   Mother -- !  They laugh ... Look at the album ... At Robert Raines ...   I remember, every day, he'd come home in a different car. That was the greatest thing ... And we'd climb all over it ... Examine every inch of every different car ...   You remember that, Kip?   After he died ... I think that's what I missed most of all ... That there was no different cars every night ... When I started hanging around Otto's ... And he started showing me the things ... It was a way to kill two birds ... Put food on the table for you and Kip ... And ... Ride in different cars every night ... Just like when Dad was here.  Tears stand in Helen's eyes ... Kip gets to his feet ...   We're gonna have to do this thing, Ma.   We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all  And she nods ...  ANGLE - A PHOTO. Robert Raines. Smiling beside an Olds 98.   This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.   The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.   All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say \"Eleanor lives at such and such... \" and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...   And there she is --  Indeed, slotted nearby is a '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500 Silver with black top ...   Hello, Eleanor --  And he looks at her. An old friend he hasn't seen in years.   She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...   She soars -   See you in a few days, Eleanor --   So what's in there -- ?   That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her \"Sway.\"   Of course ...  She studies him... Nods ...   Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --   We're going shopping -- !  We PRE-LAP Gary Numan's new-wave rave classic \"Cars\".   How's it going -- ?   Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.   Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...   Hello -- ?  Sway slides out from beneath a Testarosa ... In her greasy coveralls, hair tied back, a motorhead's dream girl ...   What's wrong with her -- ?   Annie -- ?     Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself   They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...   I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...  She nods ... Long look ...   That what you want?   Okay.  She hits the Lava soap and starts washing the grease from her hands ...   I missed you, you know -   I always thought you'd follow me up.  She shuts off the taps ... Towels her hands...   Very good...   No way ...   No ...  And he holds out a hand to her ... And she puts her greasesmeared towel into it ...   Oh. Okay. Right.   I'm on the move -   Not my girl anymore   What do you want from me?   This one ...  He slim-jims the door ... But the ALARM goes off ... A wild whooping alarm ... Deafening... Try as he might, he can't get it off. He pops the trunk. Looks for wires ... Nothing.  Then, at once, it goes off. Memphis turns. Kip is there. He holds a little DEVICE.   What's that thing -- ?   How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?   Thank-you ...   Ain't we good-timing here ... ?   Dad'd be proud --   What era was that -- ?   As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?   What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?   We've got to shake them tomorrow night. I'm making that your problem. That's called delegation of duties. You like it -- ?  Mirror Man and Tumbler regard the cops ...   Okay. Tomorrow night it's on. Each team has been assigned their ladies. The teams are: me and Sway. Donny and Freb. Kip and Tumbler. Mirror Man, you and The Sphinx ...  Mirror Man looks horrified ...   You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...   Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...   Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...   Get out of here, Ray --   Get out --   Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...   How we doing, O -- ?   Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?   Only use the phones when absolutely necessary... Otto's default HQ ... Let's go get 'em...   Ready -- ?   No. Open her ...  He parks ... Opens the back of the van ... Sway pulls the Mazda window ... Gets in ... Ignition-Gizmos her ... The motor now running ... Waits ... Memphis gets in next to her... He has a STEERING WHEEL with him.   A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...  He uses his screwdriver to REMOVE four rivets on the Mazda's Clubbed steering column ... In seconds, the CLUBBED STEERING WHEEL IS REMOVED, Club still on it. Memphis pops in the steering wheel he brought, jerry-bangs the rivets ...   Let's cruise --  And they do ... Sway rolls down her window ... Tosses something as they drive off -  ANGLE - THE OLD STEERING WHEEL. \"Club\" firmly affixed to it. On the ground, in the Mazda's old parking place...    Memphis and Sway... They ride in silence ... She busies herself by looking through the consul. Comes up with a tube of LIPSTICK. Uses the visor mirror to apply it.   Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?   Wow. Bozo, the very sexy clown --  Beat. She looks out the window, throws the following away.   No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...   Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...  She looks at him... But he's stopped the car... For Kip and Tumbler are waiting at the side of the street. They get in.    Memphis drives ... Sway, Kip, Tumbler with him...   Having fun, Kip?   How's it going?   C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?   I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --  The others are still gazing ...   Let's go, people --  And they set to work...   You okay -- ?   Too early to tell. Nervous?   That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...   That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...  Before Kip can respond, the signature throaty ROAR of Ferrari fills the room, as Sway's got one started --   Showtime --   Hello, Tracy...  Except that a MAN comes out of the house ... Mid-20s, silk shirt, long, leather Prada coat ... Persian'dude ...   Shit.  The man climbs into the Maserati. Memphis follows...   What's this guy up to -- ?  After a beat, a WOMAN comes out ... She gets into the car.   ... okay, check with you soon ...  He hangs up ...   Otto says 22 ladies have reported for work...  Sway nods ... The Maserati's windows are fully-steamed...   Man, they're going at it   What about you?  She looks at him... Shrugs...   Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.  Whispers ...   I approach you. It's quiet. I look this way. That. No one around ...   I take out my slim-jim...   Slip it in ...   Unlock your button ...   The alarms go off ...   I pop your hood; find your siren wires   I do ... I cut \"em...   Now... I'm in ...   I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...   With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...   Hear you roar ...   Let me worry about The Club ...   I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.  Back arched... A small moan escapes her ... Prince wails ... And Sway has achieved whatever kind of silly climax they aspired to here... She flops back down... Looks at him...   And Tracy's on the move ...  Indeed, the girl has gotten out of the Maserati... And the car has rocketed off... Memphis punches the gas,'sending Sway to the floor...   Donny got shot ... A jacker ...   They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...  Beat ... As they all reflect on this...   On a brighter note: 47 ladies have checked in for their South American sea cruise -  This cheers them slightly. Until, from the electrical box:   C'mon, Kip -   You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...   Call 911 -    What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?   Come here --   Come here -   Come here -  And Kip does ... He walks to Memphis ... And Memphis puts his arms around him... And that's it. The floodgates open. Kip begins to sob. Deep, painful, racking sobs. And then:   I know. I've missed you, too  And they hold each other ...   I know ...   Stay here. Stay here a while. I'll be back ...  Kip nods, sniffles ... Memphis walks out of the container ... He strides up to the others ... Glances at Toby's clipboard, with all the cars crossed-out ... He goes to Sway...   Give me a ride -- ?   Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --  And she nods ... And climbs into one of the Escorts... And off they go ... The others standing around the 'Vette and Toby's body...  ANGLE - THE CLIPBOARD. One car left. Eleanor.  As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART IV: DREAMS OF YOU   Yeah ... You -- ?  She nods ... He looks at her ...   You should know: walking away from my mother, my brother, this town. Was hard. Walking away from you. Nearly killed me...  And she smiles sadly ...   Shit ...  And kicks it into gear...    Has the radio on ... Hears Matty ... He serpentines his way through the tangle of alleys...   Shit ...  Watch the mad scramble as COPS dive into their units... And try to get out of each other's way... Fenders crunch ... Cops curse. Memphis bootlegs - going reverse down the wrong way. Left on Cambridge ... Left onto City Hall Plaza --   Yes, sir.   The truth is - my car here doesn't have a tape deck. You mind hooking me with up with some driving tunes ?   Attaboy --  And punches the gas ... Going right at Castlebeck and the others ... Smashing through the squad cars ... And ACROSS THE FOOT BRIDGE, over the swan boats ...   Thanks, brother  Spins her around... And goes    Heavy sigh... He shuts off the radio ... And there's a strange SILENCE... As everyone waits ... Watches ...    Another few beats of silence ... Everyone watching ... He punches the gas... Ripping down to the accident site... Heading straight for it ... And we fear he aims to smash the site, maybe further injure the accident victims -  Not our Memphis ... He's heading straight for    has driven up in the smashed-to-shit Eleanor ... He climbs up, entering the workshop... Calitri glances to the wallclock: 7:55  This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?   You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...   Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...   You don't want to even sniff at that --  Calitri grins. But then his smile goes south, as he sees, for the first time -- ELEANOR -- parked out on the loading dock. And she is smashed-to-shit.   What do you mean -- ?   You got no choice. It's over.   Tell you what I'm not doing: I'm not gonna let you get into my Kool Aid...  And Memphis is on him... They go rolling about in grunts and groans - eddies of sawdust swirling - the NOISE of the table saw drowning out the sounds of combat ...  Calitri is on top, grabbing an AWL from the floor, bringing the lethal point down to Memphis' face... Memphis holds Calitri's wrist, straining, the point inches from his eye  ANGLE - FLOOR SOCKET - right above Memphis' head. With a last gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl akimbo ...  Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself out inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ...  He crawls over to Memphis, climbing on him, sitting down hard on the younger man's chest ... But then Memphis grabs him by the hair and tosses Calitri off him ... Memphis POUNDS Calitri's head into the floor ...  Once, twice. Three times. Calitri is out ... Memphis gets to his feet, nose bloody. He catches his breath. Only the door opens ... And Atley is there ...   My version of \"take this job and shove it...\"   This is all about there not being a next time, Atley --  And the two men hold the look... And the van doors slam, as Digger and Butz, Calitri's grave-diggers, get out ... Atley goes to the unconscious Calitri ... And he picks him up, straining under the dead weight ... Dragging the don over to  THE OPEN CASKET - One final burst of strength and Atley drops Calitri into the casket... Slamming the swell top lid of the coffin. He turns to look at the shocked Memphis -- As Digger and Butz are there -   Absolutely.  And they are gone ... And Atley turns to Memphis   Point-five ...  And he holds out his hand ... And they shake ...   Thank you...  Atley nods ... Memphis walks out to the loading dock... Atley watches him go ...   What are you doing here?   Where'd you find this one?   You boost her -- ?   Move over ...  Kip does. Memphis gets behind the wheel. Drives...   You okay -- ?   It's over. The dumb shit is over ...  The unmarked pulls up behind him... The cop comes over ... It is, of course, Detective Castlebeck.   You know my back.  Castlebeck opens his coat... Showing stuffed holster ...   Not bad  ANGLE - CASTLEBECK at his car, on the radio ...   Don't look so glum, Detective. It's a beautiful day, the birds are singing, and there's a container ship on Pier 14, that's guaranteed to bring you glee ...  Castlebeck nods ...   Consider me gone, Detective --   Double-meaning intended --   Split it up. Any word on Donny?   What happened to Sway?   You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?   She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...  And he hands Kip the cash ...   Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like  Kip nods ... Memphis looks at a grinning Otto ...   I'll see you soon --   Thought I'd go for a ride -  He smiles. The others do, too. Memphis heads for Eleanor.   You'll see me ...  And we PRE-LAP Sammy John's \"Chevy Van\" and CUT TO:   Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?  And he uses a rag to tenderly wipe a small black smear of oil from her cheek...   I dunno. I know a place.  She looks at him... Long and hard...   Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.   What -- ?   She does have one thing you don't.   Bench seats.  And he grins ... Pats the seat beside him... And Sway slides close... He throws his arm around her ...  And off they go ... As The Turtles' (\"Eleanor/Gee, I think you're swell/And you really do me well/You're my pride and joy, etc.\" SING ON... And we hear:   You like bingo -- ?  And Eleanor drives away from us ... Into the searing horizon line ... Becoming just another single, yellow dot in the pointillist pattern that is the American road.",
        "Kip": "He didn't mess up. There it is ...  And he points ... To a CORNER BUILDING - EXOTIC MOTORS LTD. Twenty foot high glass - windows surround a SHOWROOM of EXOTIC DREAM CARS: Porsches and Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bertones ... And- there it is, a 1996 LOTUS ESPRIT V8, gleaming in the all-night showroom lights...  Freb and Mirror Man are startled   Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...  Freb scowls ... Pops the trunk ... Kip gets out ... Goes to the back ... Freb and Mirror Man share a spook --   Yeah. Ain't it great -- ?  And he pins her ... VROOOOOM -- !   Stolen fast car...  And the light turns green ... And he pops the clutch ... And they are off ... It's a good old fashioned drag race ... Kip smiles at the blonde ... Mirror Man is freaking out ... Kip's eyes are on fire ... He clocks the speedometer ...   It's calibrated for 140 ... Let's see if these British boys are full of shit or not --   No problem -  Bottles are clinked... Beer is sipped ... Only, a HOT WHITE SPOTLIGHT bores through the skylight ... And the whup-whup of the chopper's ROTORS... And now the sounds of SIRENS ... And the thuggish man gets to his feet ...   What do you say, Toby?,   No ... And they won't take my calls ...   It ain't what you'd call a \"good sign\"  He groks their fear...   Look - we managed to get 13 in a week. We just gotta step it up ...   That, too ...  Don't sweat it, Freb. We're cool.  ANGLE THE FRONT DOOR. For Memphis has entered. He clocks the room. Sees them at the rear ... Walks back   It can be done, man. We just gotta step it up... It's a challenge ...   Hello, Memphis --   It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -   It's nice to see ya, man -  He smiles ... Memphis eyeballs him... Toby is there ...   Who's got next game -- ?  And he makes to rack 'em up ... Then:   That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving   \"Give lim back the money.\" \"Give 'im back the money...\" Be nice. If only we didn't drink the money. And smoke the money. And buy Nikes with the money. And Sony Play Stations with the money. And dirty girls with the money...  And Kip sinks a ball ... Memphis looks at the others ... They nod... It's true ... The money's gone ...   But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...   Sure they are. Although we do appreciate the gesture, Memphis. But we do got it handled... And it was nice to see you -- -  Memphis nods ... Looks at all of them... Smiles ... And then REACHES OUT, GRABBING Kip by the collar, yanking him to his feet and in close, nose to nose ...   Yeah... You want a ride...   How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?   You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?   Damn crooks is everywhere --  They smile...And go to Kip's TRANS AM...   Yeah. Except the only thing he's growing is old...  And they are fronted by TWO GOONS ... Who toss them up against the wall...   What do you want -- ?  One of the goons SOCKS Toby in the gut. Toby doubles over. Kip strains to intervene, but his goon holds him back --   Don't you do that! You leave him alone!   He's got nothing to do with this --  And the goon punches him in the face. And Kip goes down. And out.   Lemme out of this --   We can still do it --  Calitri nods ... And the crusher presses ... The roof caves a bit ... Kip is close to scrunch ...   Listen, Calitri --   I get out of this I'm gonna fuck you up --  Calitri does have to admire the stones on the kid. But. Another nod. Another crusher-press. Another scrunch...   Calitri -- !  Nothing. Silence. Kip peers through the slit that the side window has become ... Only they are gone ... And there is another awful NOISE ... Kip strains to discern its origin ... Only he can't get the angle ...  We can. It's a huge CRANE, tipped with a GRIPPING CLAW... It is maneuvered over the Trans Am... Grasps it. . . And LIFTS IT INTO THE AIR ... Kip, terrified, inside ...  And, as the crane dangles the Trans Am toward the black waters of the harbor, we CUT TO:   Yeah ...   I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -   This has nothing to do with any of that --   All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...    Small, cluttered... Posters of Kurt Cobain, a skying Kobe Bryant, Pamela Anderson, two nude girls draped over a glittering Lamborghini Espada, etc. There's a fish tank... And a big-screen TV, on which the Lakers are currently defending a high-speed Boston Celtic fast-break...  Memphis sits on a ratty couch before the TV... Kip comes out of the bedroom... He's changed clothes ... He wears clunky fur-lined MOON BOOTS, leopard-skin Speedos and a tshirt ... He looks slightly ridiculous...  Throughout the scene, Memphis should be studying Kip, as if he's seeing him for the very first time ... And waiting for the inevitable crack...   Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?   you like Kobe's game? I do. You think he's heir apparent to MJ? I do. He speaks fluent Italian, you know? So he's got that going for him --  And a cut on Kip's forehead starts to bleed ... Kip grabs a towel ... Presses it to his head --   Yeah, man. Where is your beer?  Memphis holds it up ... Kip nods ... There are a pile of IGNITIONS on the table ... Kip picks one up, absently begins trying to strip it...   Cool. So you're living up North?   I heard you were pumping gas -   You're kind of cultivating a new look.   Nah. It's a scratch.   Hey, you want something to eat ?   Not much. I got olives. You like olives? Kalamata olives rule, I think. Ma likes the Calabrese. It's more mellow  And he brings over a bowl of olives.   Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --  And they nibble on them. Kip bites into one ... And the juice stings his cracked lip ... But he disguises his grimace as an appreciative nod...  And for a moment, they nibble olives and drop pits into an ashtray... Then:   About what?   About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...   Yeah. He just wants to know I'm still on it. He needs reassurance. All these big swinging dicks do. No worries. I won't let him get into our Kool-Aid...  Kip shrugs ... Picks up another olive... Remembers the pain' of the last one... Drops it back in the bowl ... Memphis is staring at him, disgusted... Kip feels it ...   What -- ?   What?  And now Memphis gets to his feet ... Paces the place...   C'mon, man... My \"demise...\"  Overreaction   Hey, now -   I can handle it --   I can handle it --   I can handle it --   Me.   Me...  Beat ... Hold the look ... Kip shifts in his chair ... Even this hurts... He tries to hide the wince ... Memphis goes to the window, looks out at the harbor below... Beat ... Then:   Why? You think you can help me?  And he turns back to Kip ...   What can you do? You haven't done anything in six years but pump gas and go overall shopping. And the cars, they've changed ... There's new shit. Computer chip keys and sophisticated alarms and I don't think, an old guy, could much bypass 'em...   Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...  And the brothers look at each other ... In the pale glow of the TV... For a long beat ... And then we'll CUT TO:   Hey, Donny --   Otto called -  Memphis looks to Otto ... Otto shrugs ...   I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...   I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...  Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head...   Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...   Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business  Freb starts to Protest ... Shrugs ...   You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...   Shadow games ...   This is loaded with crap - get a duffel.  He pulls out a set of golf clubs ... Freb brings over a duffel ... Mirror Man plucks something from the trunk ...   No shit?  And they pull back the trunk tarp ... And there are perhaps TWO DOZEN similar smack-filled BAGS ...   Take it back? What do you mean take it back? Are you crazy, man?    I was six ...  Memphis and Helen look at him... Then:   Ancient history's two things. \"Ancient.\" And \"history!\"  And he walks out of the house, door slamming behind him. Memphis turns to his mother ...   Don't go there, Toby --   Good work, Toby --  Donny and Freb are inside the Caddy ... Freb's attempts to start it fail...   How ya doing, Sway -- ?   Peugot convertible ...   Gray.   Remember who my brother is?   Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...   No. That was Higgins ....   Stumped -- !   Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R &amp; D department came up with ...   After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...   De nada ...  He gets behind the wheel. Pops the ignition. The truck's flipping stack belches. Memphis climbs in next to him.   The family that steals together, deals together...   Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...   The era when crime didn't pay --   Price of doing business...   It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say \"paper or plastic?\"  And he grins and puts the truck into gear. And off they go   There's no talkin' to him --  And Otto and Junie come out with two bottles of champagne and some paper cups ...   He's a Judge. He'll only bite for something pimpy -  At last, Toby answers ...   Oooh, she's chafed --     as they systematize the cars they're responsible for... Tumbler drops Kip off by a Porsche ... We recognize it as one of the cars Mirror Man cut a key for in the valet scam. Kip selects the key from a series of them hooked into his briefcase. He gets out. Keys the car. He's in. He's off ...  TUMBLER - meanwhile, has driven to a Volvo C70... He, too, has the key ... He's in ... He's off ...   So we loaded all of the keyed cars up and dropped 'em ... It was cake ... 8 cars, ba-da-bing ...  Memphis looks at him in the rear-view ...   Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...  Memphis looks at Sway, shakes his head... Kills the lights ... And they pull in to   I'm cool.  Memphis looks at his watch...   We gonna make it?   Nah.   I dunno. Whatever will be will be...   Pop the trunk, Tumbler.   I gotta get my tool --  And Tumbler and Mirror Man look at each other ...   Now, we go -  And he drives her off the platform. Tumbler directs him...   See ya back at the ranch, kids -- !  And off they go ... Vanishing down the street ... The others watch after him ... Mirror Man to Memphis:   Any more ...   Any more, O -- ?   Whatcha got left ... ?   We'll take it...   We'll take it.  And they climb in behind a waiting Jeep Cherokee ...   Later, Toby --  But Toby's not around...   Toby?  No answer... Kip shrugs... And off they go ...    Get her started, man -- !  And Toby does... And slams her in reverse.  And they're off   Shit ...   No...   Just hold on... Hold on ...   Hospital.   I didn't know... Should we take him to a hospital? I didn't know. I didn't.  Toby is clearly dying in Kip's arms...   Shhhhhh, shhhhh ...  Kip looks to his brother for help ...   I don't know. What -- ?  And Kip looks at him... Tears fall from the younger boy's eyes ... And Kip looks so lost ... So like a little kid...   What?   What?   I've missed you, man ...   Toby...   Toby...  And they stay in the embrace... And then Memphis unwraps Kip's arms from around him...   I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...   Ya gotta keep tabs on your \"Eleanors\", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --   Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.   I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.  Memphis nods. But then FLASHING LIGHTS behind them ... An UNMARKED with Code 3 capabilities - lights &amp; sirens ... Memphis considers ... He could make another run ... But the looks at Kip... Enough is enough ... He pulls over ...   What are you doing? You can outrun him...   I reported it ...  Memphis is impressed...   Yes, sir ...  Castlebeck sighs...   Sure, man --   You want me to buy her?   Where you off to -- ?   Hey, Memphis -- ?  Memphis turns back...   I'll see you, right?  Memphis nods ...",
        "Detective": "of G.R.A.B. The Governor's Regional Auto-theft Bureau. Castlebeck is mid-50s, black, saturnine. - But don't let the tacit nobility fool you - the man's a street viper ...  Castlebeck goes to another cop - HAWKINGS..   Well, then it's all for naught, ain't it, Hawkings?  Castlebeck looks out over the mess ... And then looks up... Because, further down Lower Grand, a car is parked. It is the Shelby. With Memphis leaning against its hood...  Castlebeck looks around him, but no one's noticed. So he walks toward it, hand on hip...   I know you --   You want to come along quiet?   Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --   How's that?   You'll leave -- ?   I don't golf...  And they stare at each other, as Castlebeck considers.   I do this. And I see you again. I'll come after you with everything I got. you won't be able to steal a glance at a blind man without me by your side ...   Get out of here, then. Now.  And Memphis makes to get into the Shelby...   Leave the car, Randall ...  Memphis nods ... Takes one last look at the Shelby... Sorry to leave it behind ... And he runs off into the mists of Lower Grand ...  Castlebeck walks back toward the crime-scene tumult ...   Arright, let lim go. Cite him for rolling the stop ... And cite old Atley for driving to endanger ...   Just like that. Quit your bellyaching, Hawkings ... And let's wrap this up ...  And off of Donny's surprised look, as Springsteen wails to crescendo and we   They're gone...  Castlebeck nods ... Looks at the cars ...   I know you.   When'd you get to town, Raines?   What for?   Where you been, anyway?   You seem a little hinked-up ...   I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...   I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...   Or your baby brother. What was his name?   Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ...   I got a rash of thefts.  A new crew is making noise. We recovered a big take - last week...   I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...  Castlebeck gives him a long look... As they walk back to the car...   Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...   By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...  He laughs... And they drive off ... Memphis watching them go ... once they're gone... He walks ...   Castlebeck.   I know you.   What are you still doing here, Randall?   What's this -- ?   What's wrong with it -- ?   Run me down a tag - 329 HRO. Cadillac.  He clicks off ... Otto and Memphis share one ... A glance to the smack ... Castlebeck is a mere inches from it ...   Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...  Before they can respond, the radio crackles ...   Something like that -  Memphis opens the driver's side door ... Gestures Castlebeck in ... Castlebeck gets behind the wheel ...   Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...   Right ...
