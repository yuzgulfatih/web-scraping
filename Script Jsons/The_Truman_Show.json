        "Marlon": "Ouch.  Whose nuts were those?    Outta your <i>job?</i>  What the hell's wrong with your <i>job?</i>  You gotta great job. You gotta <i>desk</i> job.  I'd kill for a desk job.    (still looking in the direction of his ball        I never knew anybody who got out.  (picking up the last ball marked with an initial \"T\", trying to ignore the question       What're you doing? The man told you there's no such bus.    Why would he fake it? He's not Elvis Presley.    I think you're missing your dad. The anniversary was yesterday, wasn't it?  You got sand in your cuffs.               Is someone leanin' on you, Tru?  Cos I got some friends here, they owe me.  We can lean back. Is he one of them?    Where're we going?  What're we doing here, Truman?  Where <i>what</i> started?    I don't want to put you down but why would anybody go to all this trouble over you?        All I got on me is the takings from the machines. Why do you need it?  Truman?  It's me, Marlon.    It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself?  Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview with Barbara Walters? Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?    Tru, we've known each other since before we could get a hard-on.  The only way we ever made it through high school was cheating off each other's test papers.  Jesus, they were identical. I always liked that, because whatever the answer was, we was <i>right</i> together and we was <i>wrong</i> together.  The only night either of us ever spent in jail, we spent <i>together</i> and I wet myself but you never told anyone. I was best man at your wedding and my brother was best man at <i>my</i> wedding and you didn't talk to me for a month over that and I didn't blame you because you've been more of a brother to me than he's ever been.  And I never shoulda let my Goddam father talk me into that.  I know things haven't worked out for either of us like we used to sit up on Freemont Street all night and dream they would.  We all let opportunities pass us by, none of us asks for the dance as often as we should.  I know that feeling when it's like everything's slipping away and you don't want to believe it so you look for answers someplace else.  But, well, the point is, I would gladly step in front of traffic for you.

You bin cheatin' on me?  Bout time you got this thing cleaned. Don't tell me you bin makin' your old lady wear it.    Like I say, I don't normally do this. I gotta charge extra.  You want me to do it again?  I think I could do it better.  For sure?

Good!...of course, on the day you only surface once you're safely beyond the cove...Try it one more time...You okay?

(sensing his father is keeping something from him      I want to be an explorer ...like <i>Magellan.</i>     (to Clerk, putting receiver to chest, referring to the book     (a long delay makes Truman even more uncomfortable     Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?      Stapleton on Staten Island?  I can't do it.  No, I... ...I got an appointment uptown.      I'm here to see a Mr Hamilton.  When will he be back?             I'll get something out.      I gotta get out, Marlon.  Outta my job, outta Queens...<i>out!</i>  It doesn't mean anything.      See here, this is Queens. All the way round here, Australia.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back. Y'know, there're still places in Australia where no human being has ever set foot.  It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning. You can't just up and go. Oh, I'm gonna do it, don't worry about that.  I just gotta move slow.  Pick a moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I get a retaining wall built on the back of the house I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird. I'm going, don't you worry about that.    Where do the dreams go, Marlon?  I'm <i>serious.</i>  Where do the dreams <i>go?</i>    I can't tonight.         --We could bum around the world for a year on that.  Maybe I <i>feel</i> like a teenager.  Meryl, it'd be an adventure.  That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.        (almost to himself, mouthing the word    (reading aloud, the ID number of the bus    (cowering, the fight instantly gone out of him  He's lying.  Two, four, oh, six was definitely the number.  I never believed he was dead.  (shudders, a memory flashing in his head  (ignoring the joke, pondering the morning's events  You think I imagined it, don't you?  Maybe you're right.  If only the old woman hadn't left her dog behind.     It was Dad. I swear.  If it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Can you think of a reason he'd want to hide from us?    I'm telling you he's alive!       (turning attention to an upturned mower on the garage floor      I gotta go out.  About a replacement... ...mower blade.         Lauren, right?    I haven't asked you yet.    I'm not asking you to have my children, just a pizza.  How about Saturday?  Friday?  <i>Right</i> now?  We got finals.            I don't understand.        Shut your mouth!  Leave her alone!       Veronica, what do you know for sure?              (sneaking a glance at the building directory  (riveted by the equally-stunned building occupants    Like fuck!  What're they doing?  You don't tell me, I'll get you investigated!    You ever been into the AMT Building?    Because I never do.  (looking at Lawrence's hand on his arm  Let me worry about that.      How come it's still smoking?    Someone send you to tell me all this?  (to the jogger with the familiar sneakers  You don't remember?  Two days ago I gave you my meatball sandwich in the park.  You were in a wheelchair.  Same sneakers.  (commenting ironically on his new-found mobility  Marlon. I've gotta talk to you.  I've fallen over something, Marlon. Something to do with my Dad. I think.  (ignoring the inquiries about his health  There's no point trying to show you, they cover their tracks too well.  But I've been going into a lotta strange buildings, seeing a lotta familiar faces, y'know what I mean?  Do it, anyway.  I'm deadly serious. Marlon.  We can't talk here.  I'm being followed.  I don't know.  They look just like regular people. But I've been writing down numbers - license plates, taxi numbers, ID numbers - the same ones keep cropping up over and over.    The beach.  This is where it started.  Things.  Things that don't fit.  Loose threads. False steps.  Slips of the tongue.    There were a hundred people on the beach that day.  Everybody knew what was going on except me.  Maybe I've been mistaken for somebody else. A couple of years ago, I tried to get hold of a copy of Time Magazine.  The week before an ad said, \"Next Week:  Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation\".  A guy with the same name as me in Time Magazine.  It ain't a common name so I looked out for it.  But the day it came out, every newstand was sold out.  No library had it.  I even wrote off for a back-issue.  Never seen a copy to this day.  Maybe I'm being set up for something.  You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?  I'm a walking coincidence.  I can't count 'em. No something's happening, Marlon.  I've got to get to the bottom of it.  I'm scared, Marlon.  I'm as scared as hell. But I've never felt more alive.  It's just like she said.  It doesn't matter.  She was too beautiful for here.  Can you lend me some money?  A hundred bucks.  I'm going away for a while.               I got a call in the area. What's the case?  Anything interesting?  Er, yes... No, no I'm not.  I wanna book a flight to Australia.  (believing she is being deliberately obtuse  Sorry, Sydney.  <i>Sydney,</i> Australia.  That's right.         (pointing to the agent's name tag, \"DORIS - Travel Agent\"  Why wouldn't I?    You were expecting me, weren't you?  (to agent, picking up a dictionary  That's what <i>I'd</i> like to know, Lawrence.  I was just about to resign.  Isn't that a laugh?  I just realized there's nothing to resign <i>from,</i> is there?         You don't believe a single word you're saying! None of you do! You hear me?!          (entreating the young woman, tears in his eyes           (referring to a distant car on the expressway  I predict the next four cars will be a white Honda Civic, a blue and white Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing, a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender and a motorcycle.  There's the Honda...the Dodge...here comes the dented Beetle...  Look, damn you!       Have you been concerned, Meryl?  Nice name. \"Meryl\".  I always liked it.  Actress's name, isn't it?  What's your <i>real</i> name?  Take a break. Meryl I <i>know.</i>    Shut up!    (as he shoves her into the Oldsmobile       That's right.  I do, don't I?  Cos I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?  Cos you're curious.  I haven't been curious since I was seven years old, y'know that?  Back then you'd have to nail me to the floor to keep me in one place.       (sneering at the sight of the motorists (shouting out the window to the motorists    <i>Should</i> I?    You're right.  Let's go back.  I'm sorry.  I don't know what got into me.  I've changed my mind again.  What's Maine like this time of year?! I've never been to Maine. Or let's just see where the road takes us.               No.  There's no accident.  It'S just more stalling.  What's going on?  Is there any way around?         <i>Tell me what's happening?!</i>  (backing her up against the kitchen bench  No, you're scaring <i>me,</i> Meryl!  Stop this now or I kill your leading lady. I know you can hear me.       No.  You said, \"Do something.\"  Who were you talking to?  I swear I'll kill you, if you don't tell me.    You have any idea what it's like to drown?          People know who I am, my every move, complete strangers know my name.  Even when there's no one around, I feel the eyes on me.     That's just it.  I think I <i>am</i> somebody.  Sometimes I think it's in my head, sometimes I think it's for real.                                 Fuck you!  Get the hell away!  It's my life!

    "description": "Since birth, a big fat lie defines the well-organised but humdrum life of the kind-hearted insurance salesman and ambitious explorer, Truman Burbank. Utterly unaware of the thousands of cleverly hidden cameras watching his every move, for nearly three decades, Truman's entire existence pivots around the will and the wild imagination of the ruthlessly manipulative television producer, Christof--the all-powerful TV-God of an extreme 24/7 reality show: The Truman Show. As a result, Truman's picturesque neighbourhood with the manicured lawns and the uncannily perfect residents is nothing but an elaborate state-of-the-art set, and the only truth he knows is what the worldwide television network and its deep financial interests dictate.
