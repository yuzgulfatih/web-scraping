I <u>swear</u> to you...  Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?           First things first.  That's why my wife adores me.      What're they on about?  Speaking of the Vacant Post.         Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...  ...he was <u>wealthy</u>...  ...his family has offered a large reward.           Dottore...    Pazzi, Rinaldo, Commendatore, Prefatura...  Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?

Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?      I'll have them picked up.    May we drop you?      May I ask you a personal question, Dr. Fell?  You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.  You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.  Why did you look at me that way?  ...please...    You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?  ...your <u>scar</u>..?  How so?    Yes.  How did you know?  It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?    And?  Then?  How could you know?  You know America?     Should you come across anything which...     ...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...

So, the <u>question</u>:  as always, Rinaldo, the question is one of mmm...   Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.  Dr. Fell.  You are not Italian.  And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?  Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.  But the exhibit is closing.      My husband brought it to me from America.    You know it?  And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.  Well, perhaps sometime we...    Darling...  The commissioner is going round the Cafe...

You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the <u>Government</u> says...  ...or perhaps they just don't want you anymore.  Could that be?

Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.  Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.  Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.   Due respect, sir...  Due respect, after your, after your...  <u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head.  ...sir...?  Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.   ...will he be alright...?        What would <u>that</u> be?  Now, why in the world would he do that?  What reaction?    We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.    And how would you know that?   You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...  No, no, of course not.  Tell him to give it to an orphanage.        Yes.     For approval.  Yes.  I told that woman I'm an orphan.  But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...

    "description": "The final chapter of the Dr. Hannibal Lecter quadrilogy, the murdering cannibal. He is presently in Italy, and works as a curator at a museum. Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore), the F.B.I. Agent who he aided to apprehend a serial killer, was placed in charge of an operation, but when one of her men botches it, she's called to the mat by the Bureau. One high ranking official, Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta) has it in for her. But she gets a reprieve because Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), one of Lecter's victims who is looking to get back at Lecter for what Lecter did to him, wants to use Starling to lure him out. When Lecter sends her a note, she learns that he's in Italy, so she asks the Police to keep an eye out for him. But a corrupt Policeman, who wants to get the reward that Verger placed on him, tells Verger where he is, but they fail to get him. Later, Verger decides to frame Starling, which makes Lecter return to the U.S., and the race to get Lecter begins.—rcs0411@yahoo.com",
