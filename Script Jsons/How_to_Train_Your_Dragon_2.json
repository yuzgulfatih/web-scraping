        "Snotlout": "Oh, I'm sorry, Fishlegs! Did you want that?  Here ya go, babe.  Did I tell you that you look amazing today? `Cause you do.  She's my princess! Whatever she wants, she gets.  Only for a few hours!  Uh, excuse me.  Yeah...  See how well I protect and provide?  But, baby, I grew facial hair for you.  Hookfang!  Funny and beautiful.  Could this day get any worse?  Amateur.  Black sheep, baby!  Ten points!  Uh-oh...  Don't you ever leave again, Hookfang!",
        "Starkard": "--That's me! That's me! I'm next!  I was ahead of you! Excuse me, I've been here all day!  Okay, I want one of those high seaters, with lots of spikes and a big stowage compartment.",
        "Tuffnut": "Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow this place, Belch!  Let's go!  Except for me. We're attached, genius!  Quit trying to steal all my glory!  It's MY glory! No sheep, no You're always ruining glory! EVERYTHING! Astrid leaps off of Stormfly, runs up Belch's spindly neck, and PLUCKS the black sheep from the Twins' hands.  I'll bloody his fist with my face if he tries to take my dragon!  You're such a moron.  Aggh! What is with all the nets?!  Good one.  Nope.  Yeah. Like babies. They always cry. Real tiny ones...  Uh, let me see. You'll jump into freezing cold water and then die from drowning.  Ugh. Pathetic. You can still jump.  Surprise! Yeah!  Dragon Riders coming through!  Uh, with what?  We can't fly these things!  Yeah, just like us!  Uh... how?",
        "Valka": "... but a mother never forgets.  Come...  This way. Come.  Come. Quickly!  You're not upset?  At least I'm not boring... right?  Do you like it?  Can I... ? He's beautiful!  Incredible. He might very well be the last of his kind.  And look, he's your age! No wonder you get along so well.  And retractable teeth? Ah! How did you manage to--  This Snafflefang lost his leg to one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps. This Raincutter had her wing sliced by razor netting. And this poor Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree snare... then left to die alone and scared.  And what of this? Did Drago or his trappers do this, too?  What did your father think of your Night Fury friend?  If only it were possible.  -- Believe me, I tried, as well. But people are not capable of change, Hiccup. Some of us... were just born different.  Berk was a land of kill or be killed, but I believed peace was possible.  Stop! You'll only make it worse!  It was a very unpopular opinion.  Hiccup!  One night, a dragon broke into our house, finding you in the cradle.  I rushed to protect you, but what I saw... was proof of everything I believed.  This wasn't a vicious beast, but an intelligent, gentle creature, whose soul reflected my own.  Don't!  No! Stoick!          You and your father nearly died that night, all because I couldn't kill a dragon.  It broke my heart to stay away, but I believed you'd be safer if I did.  Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm me. He must've thought I belonged here...  In the home of the great Bewilderbeast. The alpha species. One of very few that still exist. Every nest has its queen, but this is king of all dragons.  With his icy breath, this graceful giant built our nest. A safe haven for dragons everywhere.  He protects us. We all live under his care. And his command.  All but the babies, of course...  ... who listen to no one.  I've lived among them for twenty years, Hiccup, learning their ways, discovering their secrets...  He likes you.  You must be hungry.  Good. It's feeding time.   Oh, we are.  When I'm up here, I don't even feel the cold. I just feel...  This is what it is to be a dragon, Hiccup.  Incredible.  All this time, you took after me. And where was I? I'm so sorry, Hiccup. Can we start over? Will you give me another chance?  I can teach you all I've learned, these past twenty years. Like...  Now you can make those tight turns.  Every dragon has its secrets.  And I'll show them all to you. We'll unlock every mystery, find every last species, together, as mother and son. This gift we share, Hiccup... it bonds us. This is who you are, son. Who we are. We will change the world for all dragons! We will make it a better, safer place!  What? There's no talking to Drago.  -- No. We must protect our own.  Now come on, we should be getting back.       Well, what sign did I have that you could change, Stoick? That anyone on Berk could?  I pleaded so many times to stop the fighting, to find another answer, but did any of you listen?       Oh stop being so stoic, Stoick. Go on... SHOUT, SCREAM, SAY SOMETHING!     I'm... a little out of practice.                No need for drastic measures.  Yes!  We have to save the dragons.  You cannot take our dragons! They are controlled by the alpha!  No. No.  Thank you.  I'll do my best! Come on, Cloudjumper!  No!  Stoick...  It's not his fault. You know that.  Good dragons under the control of bad people do bad things.  No, don't!  You came early into this world. You were such a wee thing. So frail, so fragile. I feared you wouldn't make it.  But your father... he never doubted. He always said you'd become the strongest of them all. And he was right. You have the heart of a chief and the soul of a dragon. Only you can bring our worlds together. That is who you are, son.  Go get `em.  No! No...  To protect you.  Your father... he'd be every bit as proud as I am.  And here I'll stay.",
        "Stoick": "That's nine for the Twins, Astrid lags with three, Fishlegs and Snotlout trail with NONE!  And Hiccup is... nowhere to be found. Hmmm.  It's time, Gobber.  Get `em, Astrid!  Well played! Hahaha!  That's my future daughter-in-law!  That's thirteen! Astrid takes the game!  Any sign of him?  Oh, he's ready. You'll see.  Haha! There he is! (to Gobber, proving his  Something you're itching to tell me?  Good man! Now, lesson one. A chief's first duty is to his people. So...  Forty one? Forty --  Absolutely! You got it, sir!  Ah-ah! Lesson two. No task is too small when it comes to serving your people. Excuse us, Grump.  One of these. And this...  -- There you go! Go on. Have away.  Gobber's right, son. Best we keep to our own. Besides, you'll have more important uses for your time --  (sing-songy, under his  Bludvist? Drago Bludvist?      No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off this island until I give the word!  Because Drago Bludvist is a madman. Without conscience or mercy. And if he's built a dragon army... gods help us all.  Get them into their pens! Quickly!  No. We fortify the island.  Peace is over, Hiccup. I must prepare you for war.  Some minds won't be changed, Hiccup. Berk is what you need to worry about. A chief protects his own.        Hiccup!        Of all the irresponsible --    Years ago, there was a great gathering of chieftains to discuss the dragon scourge we all faced.  Into our midst came a stranger from a strange land, covered in scars and draped in a cloak of dragon skin. He carried no weapon and spoke softly, saying that he, Drago Bludvist, was a man of the people, devoted to freeing mankind from the tyranny of dragons.  He claimed that he alone could control the dragons and that he alone could keep us safe, if we chose to bow down and follow him.  Aye. We laughed, too...  Until he wrapped himself in his cloak and cried out, \"Then see how well you do without me!\"  The rooftop suddenly burst into flames, and from it, armored dragons descended, burning the hall to the ground.           Hiccup...  NO! Lead the others back to Berk. I've had enough mutiny for one day.  Ruffnut!  Boar-headed! Just like his mother! She could never stay put either.  You know what he's like. He won't give up, Gobber. And if Hiccup finds Drago, before we find him...  Find him, Skullcrusher. Find him.      Valka, run!  Hold on!    Valka...  Easy now.  The same way we're getting you out.  Toothless. Come.  Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.  I've heard ENOUGH, Hiccup.  Yeah, just add it to the pile.  You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.  Our son's changed Berk for the better. I think we did well with this one, Val.      Slow down, son. It's a lot to take in.                  And love...     And I would keep you from all harm, if you'd stay here beside me.  Ah... I thought I'd have to die before we'd have that dance again.  For you, my dear... anything.  Will you come home, Val? Will you be my wife once again?  We can be a family! What do you say?  Thank Odin you didn't listen to me, son. We never would have found each other.  Val! It's all right, it's all right. We're a team now. Now what do you want to do?       Come on, son.  For you, my dear... anything.  Val, do you think you can stop them?  It takes more than a little fire to kill me!      No!  Hold on!  Skullcrusher, go! Come on, Gobber!  What...?       Come on, Gobber!      Hiccup!",
        "Fishlegs": "Snotlout! That's mine!  Go, Meatlug!  Good job, Meatlug!  Here you go, darling. Mine's worth ten!  We're winning together!  Any new dragons?  A beautiful moron.  Me, too.      Large diameter bubbles, massive lungs, cold water deep dweller, I'm thinking class five leviathan, maybe six.  Sorry!  Good one, babe!    I don't want to die!  Yeah, no kidding!  He took all the dragons!  I'm okay!  Who's my little princess?  I missed you so much!",
        "Hiccup": "This... is Berk. The best kept secret this side of, well, anywhere. Granted, it may not look like much, but this wet heap of rock packs more than a few surprises.  Life here is amazing, just not for the faint of heart. See, where most folks enjoy hobbies like whittling or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer a little something we like to call--    Dragons used to be a bit of a problem here. But that was five years ago. Now they've all moved in. And, really, why wouldn't they?  We have custom stables... all-you- can-eat feeding stations... a full service dragon wash...  Even top-of-the-line fire prevention, if I do say so myself.  Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect. All of my hard work has paid off. And it's a good thing, too, because with Vikings on the backs of dragons, the world just got a whole lot bigger.  Yeah!  What do you think, bud? Wanna give this another shot?  Toothless! It'll be fine.  Ready?  This is amazing!  No longer amazing! Toothless!  Oh, no!  That really came out of nowhere.  We gotta work on your solo gliding there, bud. That locked-up tail makes for some pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers, eh?  Looks like we found another one, bud.  Oh, what? Do you want an apology? Is that why you're pouting, big baby boo? Well... try this on!  Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up on all my heartfelt remorse?  Oh, come on. You wouldn't hurt a  You're right! You're right! You win! You win!  He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons and Vikings, enemies again, locked in combat to the bitter -- URFFF!  Gaaaaagh!  You KNOW that doesn't wash out.  So what should we name it?  \"Itchy Armpit\" it is.  Whaddya reckon, bud? Think we might find a few Timberjacks in those woods? The odd Whispering Death or two in the rocks? Who knows... maybe we'll finally track down another Night Fury. Wouldn't that be something? So, whaddya say? Just keep going?  `Afternoon m'lady. Where have you been?  Avoiding my dad.  Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake up. The sun's shining. Terrible Terrors are singing on the rooftop. I saunter down to breakfast, thinking all is right with the world, and I get...      Okay, first of all, I don't sound like that. What is this character? And second... what is that thing you're doing with my shoulders?  A truly flattering impersonation. Anyway, he goes...  You're the pride of Berk, son, and I couldn't be prouder...  Aw, thanks, Dad. I'm pretty impressed with myself, too.  WHEN have I ever done that with my hands?  Okay... just... (holding her arms, mock-   You're all grown up, and since no chief could ask for a better successor, I've decided--  You're gonna wear out the spring coil. The calibration is very sensitive!  Yeah, so... this is what I'm dealing with.  I didn't. By the time he turned around, I was gone.  It's not me, Astrid. All those speeches, and planning, and running the village... that's his thing.  I'm not like you. You know exactly who you are. You always have. But...  I'm still looking. I know that I'm not my father... and I never met my mother... so, what does that make me?  Maybe. But, y'know... there is something out there.  Stay close.  What happened here?  Easy, bud.  Astrid! Look out!         Look, we don't want any trouble.  Wait...  You think we did this?  What do-gooder -- there are other dragon riders?  Drago what-fist? Does anything you say make sense?     Just give us back our dragon, and we'll go, strange, hostile person whom we've never met.  And this is Toothless. He says we're going. Now.  Sorry. Got held up.  Hey, Dad, could I have a word?  Not quite the itch you're thinking of, but yes.  Could we just talk in private for--  Dad, this is actually a little more important than building saddles.    But, seriously, I really need to tell you about this new land we came across.  We didn't stick around to find out. These folks weren't particularly friendly.  No, this was different. Not the standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha I've come to enjoy. These guys were trappers. Dragon trappers.  I've never seen anything like it. And worst of all, they thought we did it!  They are building a dragon army.  Or at least the guy they work for is. Dargo Bloody Fist or something.  Uh, yeah. Wait. You know him?  What? Why?!  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is happening?  Because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble in some faraway land?  Then let's ride back out there. We'll follow those trappers to Drago and talk some sense into him.  It's our duty to keep the peace!  War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our dragons, we can't wait around for him to get here. Let's go find him and change his mind.  I have to.      Come on!  Nope. It's your lucky day. We give up.  That's one Night Fury, one Deadly Nadder, and...  ... two of the finest dragon riders west of Luk Tuk. That oughtta make the boss happy, right?  Excuse us.  Toothless, stay.  The dragons don't really care for cramped spaces, so they'll just hang out with you. They won't be any trouble.  Unless you do that. Wooden boat, big ocean. How's your swimming?  Oops. Almost forgot. Can't have armed prisoners!  Just what every dragon trapper needs. One end coats the blade in Monstrous Nightmare saliva. The other sprays Hideous Zippleback gas. All it takes is a spark and...  Oh, yeah, there you go!  Once they see you as one of their own, even the testiest dragons can be trained, right, bud?  No game. We just want to meet Drago.  Because I'm going to change his mind about dragons.  Once you've earned his loyalty, there is nothing a dragon won't do for you.  I can change yours. Right here. Right now.  May I?  Put me down! Snotlout! What are you doing?    I DON'T NEED to be rescued!  No.  -- I'm trying to protect our dragons and stop a war! How is that irresponsible?  Maybe.  I'm still going to try.  This is what I'm good at. And if I could change your mind... I can change his, too. Come on.  Don't worry, bud. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I promise.        Hold on, hold on.  Toothless!    We have to head back for my dragon!  Who are you? The Dragon Thief? Drago Bludvist?  Do you even understand what I'm saying?  Toothless!  It's okay. I'm glad to see you, too, bud. You really had me worried there.  Uh, should I... should I know you?  Hold on! Wait just a minute! Come back here!  You can't just say something like that and run off! You're my mother?! I mean, what the -- do you grasp how INSANE it sounds?! I have questions!  Where have you been all this time?  What've you been doing?! They said you were dead! Everyone thinks you were eaten by...  This is where you've been for twenty years?  You've been rescuing them.  Unbelievable.  What? No. I don't know. It's a bit much to get my head around, to be frank. It's not every day you find out your mother is some kind of crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady.  I suppose there is that...  ... one... specific... thing...  I don't have the words.  --I found him in the woods. He was shot down and wounded.  Heh. Well, crazy thing is... I'm actually the one who shot him down.  It's okay though. He got me back.  Right, bud? You couldn't save all of me, could you? You just had to make it even. So... peg leg!  He didn't take it all that well.  But then... he changed. They all did. Pretty soon everyone back home had dragons of their own.  No, really, I --  Yeah, it runs in the family.  How did you survive?  Wait, that's the ice-spitter? He's responsible for all that destruction?  Wow.  Uh, yeah. I could eat.  Hey, I thought we were going to eat?  And from Dragon Island, I found this archipelago...  Free.  It's all well and good to call yourself a dragon.  But can you fly?  Oh no. Toothless!  Man! Almost! We just about had it that time!  Well, not bad yourself.  Did YOU know about this?  That sounds... amazing.  This is so great! Now you and I can go talk to Drago -- together!  But we have to --  Meatlug! What's wrong, girl?        Are you kidding me? How'd you get in here?  We?  Dad! There's something you need to know!  This isn't an on-the-way kind of update, actually...  ... more of the earth-shattering development variety.  Dad, unlike most surprises I spring on you, this is one you'll like. I promise! You just have to handle it delicately, so...  Dad, can you put the sword away... please?  Mom, you'd never recognize it! Where we used to make weapons, we now build saddles, wing slings -- we even fix dragon teeth! You wouldn't believe how much everything's changed!  Thanks, Dad.  And once you move back in, with all of your dragons, Drago won't even stand a chance. Everything will be okay!  Oh. Gotcha.  Gobber!  Toothless?  What's happening?  Oh, no...  Welcome aboard, dragon rider!  Oh, y'know. Catching up with Mom.  Well, now you know where I get my dramatic flair.  There! Come on, Toothless! Show them what you got, bud.  Thatta boy!      STOP! Stop!  All of this loss, and for what? To become unstoppable? To rule the world?  Dragons are kind, amazing creatures that can bring people together.  Then why a dragon army?  Or maybe you need dragons to conquer people. To control those who follow you... and to get rid of those who won't.  The world wants peace. And we have the answer, back on Berk. Just let me show you.  Toothless? You okay, bud? What's going on?  Uh, what did he just tell you?     Toothless, what's the matter with you? What're you doing?  Knock it off! Stop! Snap out of it!  Toothless! No! Toothless! Don't!      Dad!  No... you...  No! Get away from him!    Toothless!  I'm sorry, Dad.  I'm not the chief that you wanted me to be. And I'm not peacekeeper I thought I was. I don't know...  I was so afraid of becoming my dad. Mostly because I thought I never could. How do you become someone that great? That brave? That selfless? I guess you can only try.  A chief protects his own. We're going back.  Not all of them.  They're babies. They don't listen to anyone!  Well, it's a good thing that I never listen.  Get Toothless back and kick Drago's-  And that thing.  No...          Toothless? It's me, bud. It's me. I'm right here. Come back to me.  It wasn't your fault, bud. They made you do it.  You'd never hurt him. You'd never hurt me.  Please. You are my best friend, bud.  My best friend.  Thatta boy! That's it! I'm here!  Yeah!  Hang on!  Almost there, buddy. Almost there!  We need to get those two apart.  We gotta block him out, Toothless. Do you trust me, bud?  We can do this. You and me. As one.  That's it. Now let's try this one more time!  Shut it out, Toothless!    Not again.  Come on, bud!  Hold on!  Yeah! We did it!  Hold him there Toothless!  It's all over now.  Oh, no!  He's challenging the alpha!  Now do you get it? This is what it is to earn a dragon's loyalty. Let this end now.  The alpha protects them all.  You never cease to amaze me, bud. Thank you.  Toothless! You know that doesn't wash out.  Y'know, Skullcrusher's gonna need somebody to look after him now.  Thank you. I'm really glad you're here, Mom.  Ha, ha. Still doing that one? That's hilarious. Come here, you.  This... is Berk. A bit trampled and busted and covered in ice, but it's home. It's our home.  Those who attacked us are relentless and crazy. But those who stopped them? Oh, even more so!  We may be small in numbers, but we stand for something bigger than anything the world can pit against us.  We are the voice of peace. And bit by bit, we will change this world.  You see, we have something they don't. Oh sure, they have armies and they have armadas...  But we... we have...",
        "Astrid": "What are you doing, Snotlout?! They're going to win now!  Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury you alive?!  The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly! We can still win this thing!  Up, up, up!  No!  You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?!  Gotcha!  eyeing the fast-approaching FINISH LINE, unaware as... FISHLEGS suddenly RAMS Meatlug into Stormfly, sending Astrid off-course. She recovers and sees Snotlout flying headlong toward her, war hammer cocked, aiming at Astrid.  Stormfly!  Winning races. What else? The real question is... where have YOU been?  Oh, no. What happened now?       (continuing her impression  You just did.  --TO MAKE YOU CHIEF! Oh, my gods!  Hiccup, that's amazing!      Well, it's a lot of responsibility. The map will have to wait for sure, and I'll need to fly Toothless, since you'll be too busy...  I think you're missing the point. I mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be pretty excited.  What you're searching for... isn't out there, Hiccup.  It's in here. Maybe you just don't see it yet.        Hiccup!      Dragon army?  What are you talking about?  Stormfly! C'mon, go! Go!  You should've seen their fort. All blown apart and stuck in giant spikes of ice. It was weird.  Hiccup, don't.  What are you doing?  How is this a plan?  He can be really persuasive.    Let's go.  I don't like it. They should've been back with Hiccup by now.  What if Drago shot them down? What if they need our help? We have to find them.  It doesn't matter what he said, if they've all been captured. Come on!  Careful what you wish for!  A kidnapping.  You're gonna show us the way to Drago.  That can be arranged. Stormfly, drop it.  Good girl! Stormfly, fetch.  Works every time.  Never take a toy from a dragon. Don't you know anything?  What's down there?  What are you doing?  What?! Are you kidding me?!  Drago doesn't have them after all.  Hundreds! A whole island full!  Oh, yes they will!  They know we're missing and they have tracking dragons. If you so much as touch us, Hiccup is gonna  He's only the son of Stoick the Vast...  ... his heir to the throne of Berk... and the greatest dragon master this world has ever seen!  And unless you let us go, right now, he will blast through here on his Night Fury and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters!      You are a steaming heap of dragon --  Meatlug?  You really are full of surprises.  Let's go!  Up, girl! To the left, Eret! That's it! Look out!  Where have you been?  That's your mother?!  But won't that Bewilderbeast just take control of these guys, too?  Take them down, babe!  Stormfly!  See? I told you it was in here.",
        "Drago": "Drop the ropes.   You belong to me now.  How many?    -- Hiccup?  Dragon master? I ALONE control the dragons!  First there was one rider. And now all of Berk. And YOU led them to me.      And get rid of him.                          Whatever comes, keep hitting the mountain! We need to draw the alpha out.  Ready the traps!      Dragon Master.  The alpha! Now we have a fight!  I've waited a long time for this!          Come on! Take down the alpha!  You... I watched you burn!         We've won.  Now finish her!          This... is the great dragon master? The son of Stoick the Vast? What shame he must feel.  Or tear them apart.  You see, I know what it is to live in fear. To see my village burned, my family taken.  But even as a boy, left with nothing, I vowed to rise above the fear of dragons and liberate the people of this world.   Well, you need dragons to conquer other dragons.  Clever boy.  NO! Let ME show YOU.      No dragon can resist the alpha's command. So he who controls the alpha, controls them all.  Witness true strength. The strength of will over others. In the face of it, you are nothing.    Move out!            Your chief is dead.  No one can protect you now.  What?  You certainly are hard to get rid of. I'll say that.  He is not yours anymore. He belongs to the alpha!  But, please, oh great dragon master, try to take him. He will not miss a second time.  How are you doing that?  No!  Do something!  Take control of it!    Agghh!       No, no, no, no! Fight back! Fight!   What's the matter with you?  Never! Come on!",
        "Gobber": "Scared him off with the big talk, didn't ya, Stoick?  Righty-ho!  Last lap!  This is your big moment. Have a nice flight!  Ah, he's probably flown off the edge of the world by now. You sure you want that kid running the village? You can still delay your retirement.  Who finally decided to show up for work. Yay.  Grump! You let the forge die down again!  That's it, Grump. You're going up for adoption!  Another one?!  Oh, really? Your Night Fury and Deadly Nadder didn't bring them cheering to the rooftops?  Y'know, you two are gonna get yourselves in SERIOUS trouble one of these days. Not everyone appreciates this way of life.  You heard the man! Lock it down!  We're here to RESCUE you!  Anyone else?  That's what I figured.  Ah, he's just twenty. And a Viking. I mean, could there be a worse combination? Ha! When I think of how stubborn and senseless YOU were back in the day... well, not much has changed, actually.  Bah! NOTHING can hurt Hiccup so long as that Night Fury's around. It's a Night Fury!  All clear!  Uh, you might want to take this one. Oh, boy.  This is why I never married. This and one other reason.   I hope not. Her meatballs could kill more beasts than a battle axe.  I've still got a few knocking around in here. Ha ha!  Oh, I love this one!     C'mon, Hiccup! VALKA, STOICK, &amp; GOBBER To love and kiss, to sweetly hold. For the dancing and the dreaming. Through all life's sorrows and delights, I'll keep your love inside me. VALKA, STOICK, &amp; GOBBER I'll swim and sail through savage seas, with ne'er a fear of drowning. And gladly ride the waves of life, if you will marry me!       I'm done.  Great! I'll do the cooking!  Heads up!  Stoick!  Right behind ya, Stoick!  Okay, change of plans.  May the Valkyries welcome you, and lead you through Odin's great battlefield. May they sing your name with love and fury, so that we might hear it rise from the heights of Valhalla... and know that you've taken your rightful place at the table of kings.  For a great man has fallen. A warrior. A chieftain. A father. A friend.  This... is... very dangerous!  Some might suggest this is poorly conceived.  So what IS your plan?!  Heads up!  Oh, give me a cuddle, Grumpy!  Ooh.  The chief has come home!",
        "Ruffnut": "Come on, Barf. It's starting to stink around here.  Come on, Barf!  Yeah! The Black Sheep!  I'm totally winning!  No one can stop me now!  It's MY glory! No sheep, no You're always ruining glory! EVERYTHING! Astrid leaps off of Stormfly, runs up Belch's spindly neck, and PLUCKS the black sheep from the Twins' hands.  Astrid!  Or mine.  Hey watch it! That was close...  Oh, my.  Me likey.  Take me.  Stupid.  Ooh, I like that.       I don't like it either. Eret son of Eret was the man of my dreams. My everything!  Yay! Can he ride with me? Can he? Can he?  Hey!  But you were so perfect!  Then they'll be crying like babies!  Get `em, you son of an Eret!  Okay, I love you again.  I don't know. You just keep doing what you're doing. Keep crankin'...  Eret, son of Eret!  He took all the dragons.  Fly straight!  Keep `em coming!  Oh Barf!  Not you.",
        "Teeny": "He's expecting a new shipment of dragons for his army by tomorrow.",
        "Eret": "Fire!  Watch the tail!  Tie those legs up!  Is that what I think it is?  Back again?  Soil my britches... that is a Night Fury. Thought they were all gone for good.  Looks like our luck's had a turn for the better, lads! Don't think Drago has one of those in his dragon army.  Ha! You should've thought of that before you stole all of our dragons and blasted our fort to bits!  Dragon trapping is hard enough work as it is, without do-gooder dragon riders sneaking in to rescue them.  You mean, other than your thieving friend from last night? You tell me.  You may have an ice-spitting dragon on your side, but we still have a quota to fill. How do you suppose we explain this mess to Drago Bludvist?  This is what he gave me last time I showed up empty-handed. He promised to be far less understanding in the future.  Oh, where are my manners? I'm Eret. Son of Eret. Finest dragon trapper alive.  After all, it's not just anyone who can capture a Night Fury.  Heh. They all say that.    Keep your eyes peeled, lads! With this wind, we'll reach Drago by daybreak, so best we fill this ship up with dragons and quick! It's no time to be picky. Not if we want to keep our --    Net `em, lads! Take `em down!  You're not getting away this time.  And here I was worried we might turn up empty-handed.  Give me that!  What game are you playing?  Why?  Puh! You won't be changing any minds around here.  Dragon riders!  Well, didn't you just pick the wrong ship, eh? I am Eret, son of --   Get... this... thing... off... me!  We've nowhere to go! Nothing to sell! And no heads to call our own, if we don't turn up with dragons and fast --   What is this?!  And help dragon riders sneak into Drago's camp? Just kill me now.    Agghh! Okay! I got you here, now get this thing off me!         Get off me!  Always great to see you, my friend! Keeping warm up here?  Well, as you can see, I'm right on time with a new batch of dragons, just like I promised.  And as an added bonus, I also caught you their riders. No extra charge.  Turns out, there's a whole bunch of them out there. They --  I wouldn't worry about it. My men are hunting them down as we speak. They won't know where you're hiding. I promise you that.  He's not a problem. Really. Trust me.  Drago!  You're overreacting!  Drago, please...  Looks refreshing.  Please, ladies first.  -- Duck.  So? Are we going to save your dragons and get out of here or not?  Check every trap. They're here somewhere.      Anyone coming?  Thank you for saving my life. Now let me return the favor.  Thanks. I think.  Whoa...  Have you forgotten who you're riding with?  There isn't a dragon alive that I can't wrangle!  Except for this one!  That was some pretty fine dragon wrangling back there. You'd make a good trapper.  Me?  I'd be honored."
