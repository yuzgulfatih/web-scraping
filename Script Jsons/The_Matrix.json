        "Agent": "Lieutenant?   Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --   The orders were for your protection.  The Lieutenant laughs.   No, Lieutenant, your men are dead.    Did you get anything from the room?   Their next target.  The name is Neo.  The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground, separated in the crash like a severed limb.   We'll need a search running.   It's already begun.  We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER and CLOSER, UNTIL the smooth gray plastic spreads out like a horizon and the small HOLES WIDEN until we fall through one --  Swallowed by the darkness that becomes --  A computer screen.  We are on-line, inside a chat room called \"The Matrix.\" It is an exklusive web-site where hackers hang out.   As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.  He opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he flips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at the file or at him.   It seems that you have been living two lives.  In one life, you are Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company.  You have a social security number, you pay your taxes and you help your land lady carry out her garbage.  The pages continue to turn.   The other life is lived in computers where you go by the hacker alias Neo, and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for, including the unauthorized use of the D.M.V. system for the removal of automobile boots.  Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.   One of these,lives has a future. One of them does not.  He closes the file.   I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are here because we need your help.  He removes his sunglasses; his eyes are an unnatural ice- blue.   We know that you have been contacted by a certain individual. A man who calls himself Morpheus. Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant to the fact that he is wanted for acts of terrorism in more countries than any other man in the world.  He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive.  He leans closer.   My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you, but I believe you want to do the right thing.  It is obvious that you are an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson, and that you are interested in the future.  That is why I believe you are ready to put your past mistakes behind you and get on with your life.  Neo tries to match his stare.   We are willing to wipe the slate clean, to give you a fresh start and all we are asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.  Neo nods to himself.   You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.   The irony of your situation is that you have no choice.   And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what good is a phone call iy you are unable to speak?  The question unnerves Neo and strangely, he begins to feel the muscles in his jaw tighten.  The standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion grow into panic.  Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly seal shut, melding into each other until all trace of his mouth is gone.  Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents restrain him holding him in the chair.   You are going to help us, Mr. Anderson, whether you want to or not.  Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.  From a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a long, fiber-optic wire tap.  Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over his exposed abdomen.  Horrified, he watches as the electronic device animates, become an organic creature that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.  Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into Neo's navel.  He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --  Before it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it worms its way inside.    Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?  Cypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his teeth.   Then we have a deal?   Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.  Cypher takes a deep drink of wine.   Access codes to Zion.   Morpheus.    Eighth floor.  They're on the eighth floor.    Eighth floor!  Move!    Where are they?    Are orders that hard to follow? I'll say it again.  Morpheus must be taken alive.  Understand?    How like a rodent.    We have them now.    So, we meet at last.   Smith.  I am Agent Smith.   I've been waiting for this noment.  Faster than a snake spits, Morpheus cracks Smith with a jaw-breaking right.   You can't win.  Morpheus smiles.   Take him.  Cops swarm over Morpheus.    The others were lost.   You've taken care of Reagan?  Agent Jones nods.   Then the others do not matter.    There is a problem.  Reagan has failed to secure the hardware.  Agent Smith stares out the window.   Never send a human to do a machine's job.   But if Reagan has failed, why haven't they pulled the plug?   Haven't you learned by now, that it is impossible to understand why they do the things they do?  He turns.   Continue as planned.  Trace his signal to locate their position and deploy an extermination unit.  Morpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist. He is bleeding from numerous wounds and is pumped full of serum, alternately shivering and sweating.  He is hooked up to various monitors with white disk electrodes.  Agent Brown begins running a trace program.    Have you ever stood and stared at it, Morpheus?  Marveled at its beauty.  Its genius.  Billions of people just living out their lives... oblivious.  Agent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a hypodermic needle.   Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world?  Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy.  It was a disaster.  No one would accept the program.  Entire crops were lost.  Agent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus' shoulder, and plunges down.   Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world.  But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery.  Agent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react violently to the injection.   The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.  Which is why the Matrix was re-designed to this:  the peak of your civilization.  He turns from the window.   I say 'your civilization' because as soon as we start thinking for you, it really becomes our civilization, which is, of course, what this is all about.  He sits down directly in front of Morpheus.   Evolution, Morpheus.  Evolution.  He lifts Morpheus' head.   Like the dinosaur.  Look out that window.  You had your time.  Morpheus stares hard at him, trying hard not to show the pain racking his mind.   The future is our world, Morpheus. The future is our time.    I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species.  I've realized that you are not actually mammals.  The life signs continue their chaotic patterns.   Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment.  But you humans do not.  You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area.  He leans forward.   There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.  Do you know what it is? A virus.  He smiles.   Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet.  You are a plague.  And we are... the cure.    Why isn't the serum working?   Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions.   Or he doesn't know.   Of course he knows.  He's resisting.   How?   I don't know.  If I knew...  Agent Smith hides his knotting fist.  He is becoming angry.  It is something that isn't supposed to happen to agents.   Leave me with him.  Agent Brown and Jones look at each other.   Now!   Can you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm going to be honest with you.  He removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his shoulder.   I hate this place.  This zoo. This prison.  This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer.  It's the smell, if there is such a thing.  I feel saturated by it.  I can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it.  He wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips of his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose.   Repulsive, isn't it?  He lifts Morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both hands.   I must get out of here, I must get free.  In this mind is tlie key. My key.  Morpheus sneers through his pain.   Once Zion is gone, there's no need for me to be here.  Do you understand?  I need the codes.  I have to get inside Zion.  You have to tell me how.  He begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh.   Tell me!  Tell me!  The skull is about to shatter when Agents Jones and Brown burst into the room.  Agent Smith releases Morpheus.   What were you doing?  Agent Smith recovers, replacing his ear piece.   You don't know.   Know what?  Agent Smith listens to his earphone, not believing what he is hearing.    I think they're trying to save him.    Lower level --   They are actually attacking.    Find them and destroy them!  Agent Jones nods and touches his ear piece.    Only human...  Suddenly Agent Jones stops.  Something is wrong.  He scans the roof.  Trinity is gone.  Immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the muzzle of her .45 --  Jammed right into his head.   Remain at your posts.   You will do as you are ordered!   No.  The GUN jumps and BULLETS EXPLODE through the WINDOW in a cacophony of CRASHING GLASS --  As the Agents go for their weapons.  But Neo is too close, the .50 CALIBER too fast and BULLETS are everywhere, perforating the room.  Agent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back, blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --  Then Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls.  And finally Agent Jones.  Neo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action.   Nooo!  He FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a perfect line.  For an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the WALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of chalk.  And as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet buries itself in his leg --  Knocking him off balance.   The trace was completed.   We have their position.   The extermination unit is in place.   Order the strike.  Agent Smith can't stand listening to them.  He moves to the edge of the building, looking out at the surrounding city.   They're not out yet.    You're empty.  Neo pulls the TRIGGER.  CLICK.   You can't win.   Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?  Agent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold, forcing him to look down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a hole in the darkness.   That is the sound of inevitability.  Neo sees it coming and he starts to fight.   It is the sound of your death.  There is another METAL SCREECH, MUCH LOUDER, closer, as Agent Smith tightens his hold.  Neo is unable to breathe.   Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.  The TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent Smith's words.  The veins bulge in Neo's head, as he grits through the pain.  He is not ready to die.   Check him.    He's gone.  Agent Smith smiles, standing over him.   I told you, you couldn't win.    Nooooo!  Agent Smith pounds on the elevator door.",
        "Smith": "Lieutenant?   Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --   The orders were for your protection.  The Lieutenant laughs.   No, Lieutenant, your men are dead.

        "Switch": "What if he does?   God, I love that sound.    Oh God.  Wearing Tank's operator headgear, Cypher moves among the silent bodies.",
        "Apoc": "Come with me.  Neo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and two police officers rush in, drawing their guns.  Apoc grabs Neo, muscling him to the nearest exit.  There is no upcoming station.  Apoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles against its own speed.  The cops are thrown back.  Neo slams against the metal rail.  The doors open onto nothing and just when Neo regains his balance, Apoc shoves him backwards --  He flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls from, the raised tracks --  Hurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere, a truck races under him and --  He crashes into a large dumpster-bed filled with empty boxes.    Almost.  He and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex system of monitors, modules and drives.   That's right.   Still nothing.  Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.   Targeting... almost there.  An ALARM, on Trinity's monitor ERUPTS.   Lock!  I got him!   Morpheus is right.  He's got to be the one.    No way.  Not possible.   He won't.   What?!",
        "Neo": "It is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with technology.  Weed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into thickets that wind up and around the legs of several desks.  Tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay open like an autopsied corpse.  We turn towards the center of this rat-nest of technology, following the slurping and crunching of cereal.  We pass an open box of Capln Crunch as we find --  NEO, a younger man who knows more about living inside a computer than living outside one.   Fuckin' idiots don't know shit.  He finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an anonynous message slices onto the screen.   What the hell...   What do you want, Anthony?   You got the money this time?  He holds up two hundred dollars and Neo opens the door. Anthony's girlfriend, DUJOUR, stops in front of Neo.    They watch from the window as the cops, silently, robotically, climb into their van.   I don't know.  I have to work tomorrow.   Yeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go.    How did you know that --   Who are you?   Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?   Gee-zus.   I just thought... you were a guy.   Do you want to go sorewhere and talk?   That was you on the board tonight. That was your note, wasn't it?   Who wouldn't?   What?  Why?   I don't understand --   The Matrix.  What is the Matrix?   Wait.  Who was it?  Who was the man?  She leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she whispers.    The sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to consciousness.  He strains to read the clock face:  Shitshitshit.    Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly clear.    The entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of elevators.  Neo slumps down into his chair.  A TALL EMPLOYEE stands up in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition.   If I was late again, I'm going to be fired.  He smirks.   Yeah.  That's me.  Neo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex guy hands him the softpak.   Hello?   ... no.   Who's coming for me?   Right now?   Holy fuckin' shit!   What the fuck do they want with me?!   How?!   But what if...?   How do you know all this?  Morpheus laughs quietly.   No! It's too far away.   No way, no way, this is crazy.   This is insane!  Why is this happening to me?  What did I do? I'm nobody.  I didn't do anything. Fuck! Fuck!  Fuck!  He climbs up onto the window ledge.  Hanging onto the frame, he steps onto the small ledge.  The scaffold seems even farther away.   I'm going to die.  The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building, knocking Neo off balance.  Recoiling, he clings harder to the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.  He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.   This is insane.  I can't do this! Forget it!  He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the door.   I didn't do anything!    Yeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a real good deal.  But I think I have a better one.  How about I give you the finger --  He does.   And you can cram that file up your Secret Service sphincter.  Agent Smith puts his glasses back on.   You ain't seen nothing yet.   You can't scare me with this gestapo crap.  I know my rights. I want my phone call.  Agent Smith smiles.    Screaming, Neo bolts upright in bed.  He realizes that he is home.  Was it a dream?  His mouth is normal.  His stomach looks fine.  He starts to take a deep, everything-is-okay breath, when --  The PHONE RINGS.  It almost stops his heart.  It CONTINUES RINGING, building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed, sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.  He answers it, saying nothing.   The agents --   ... Yes.   What are you doing?   What are you doing?   Jesus!  God!   Do what?  The instant he hears the word, he knows.   Oh, shit --  The cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his chest.  Gizmo wrestles with the bug.   It's an honor.   You could say that.   You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.   No.   Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.   What gift?   It's not magic.   Free from what?   What truth?   How?   Apoc?  You wrote the Four Horsemen Virus.   A little.   Essentially, it's a hardware system that uses an apparatus; headgear, gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a computer program.   You might not, no.   You did all this?  She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears. They are wired to an old hotel phone.   Shit...  Cypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent data.  Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs.  Neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers disappear beneath the rippling surface.  Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy stuck to his fingertips.   What is this?  Mescaline?   Uh-oh...   It's cold.  The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic, tipping his head as though he were sinking into the mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.   It's all over me --  Morpheus is right next to him, with the phone.    Neo's eyes flutter open.  We see Trinity's face above us, angelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick.      ... am I dead?    He opens his eyes again, something tingling through him. He focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of acupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device.   What are you doing?   Why do my eyes hurt?    Neo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better.  He is wearing a black tank top and shorts.  He begins to examine himself.  There is a futuristic IV plugged into the jack in his forearm.  He pulls it out, staring at the grafted outlet.  He feels his bald head.  His fingers find and explore the large outlet in the base of his skull.  Just as he starts to come unglued, Morpheus opens the door.   Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?   When?   That's not possible.   How?   Right now, we're inside a computer program?   This isn't real?   What happened?   No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!   Stop!  Let me out!  I want out!    Get this thing out of me!   Don't touch me!  Get away from me!  On his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins. Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull as if his brian had been put into a centrifuge.    He blinks, regaining consciousness.  The room is dark. Neo is stretched out on his bed.   I can't go back, can I?  Morpheus sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far corner.   I told you I don't believe in fate.  Morpheus smiles, leaning towards hin.   For what?    Neo is awake in his bed, staring up at the lights.  The door opens and TA.NK steps inside.   No.   You don't have...   Zion?   Jiujitsu?  I'm going to learn jujitsu?  Tank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive.   No way.  Smiling, Tank punches the \"load\" code.  His body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp shut.  The monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds, adrenaline surges, and his brain sizzles.  An instant later his eyes snap open.   Holy shit!   Hell yes!    This is incredible.  I know Kung Fu.  Morpheus sits in the drive chair next to hin.  He nods to Tank.   You -- You're too fast.   I, uh... maybe.   I feel better.   Shit.  Neo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at Morpheus an impossible fifty feet away.   Okie dokie.  He takes a deep breath.   Yeah.  Free my mind.  Right.  No problem.  He concentrates.  Runs.    I thought it wasn't real.  Neo stares at the blood.   If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?    Trinity enters from the hall, carrying a try of food.   Sorry.   What are you doing?   Is that... ?   Jeez, I was wondering about that.   Why I was bald here but not in the Matrix.   Residual self image.   Life systems monitor, glucose levels.   Main power supply to the core.  He follows Tank to the operator's station where he points to a red key-switch.   Mainframe self-destruct.  Uses all remaining power to generate an...  What's he talking about?   See who?   Did you have to do this?   What did she tell you?   Any of them true?  Trinity looks at him, then looks away.   The agents.  They're sentient programs.  They can commandeer any software hardwired to the mainframe.   The best hacking is always traceless.  Cypher and Trinity move away from them, securing the perimeter.  As Cypher passes a garbage can, he surreptitiously drops something inside.  It is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as the LINE CONNECTS.  An early 1970s, black Lincoln Continental emerges from a corrugated roll-up garage.  Morpheus and Neo get in.    What -- what happened?   There is no spoon.  Right.  He concentrates.  The spoon begins to bend just as the Priestess touches his shoulder.   Hello?  A DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up the stairs.  At the top of the dais, he smells something cooking.  Following the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he finds an open door.   Hello?   You're the Oracle?   Yeah.   What vase?  He turns to look around and his elbow knocks a VASE from the table.  It BREAKS against the linoleum floor.   Shit, I'm sorry.  She pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns. She is an older woman, wearing big oven mitts, comfortable slacks and a print blouse.  She looks like someone's grandma.   How did you know...?  She sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot-pad.   Who?   I think so.   I don't know.  She gestures to a wooden plaque, the kind every grandma has, except that the words are in Latin.   What's the good news?   Is that it, then?   You do?   Whoa.  Deja vu.  Those words stop the others dead in their tracks.    Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.   A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.   It might have been.  I'm not sure.  Trinity looks at Morpheus, who listens quietly to the rasping breath of the old building.   What is it?   I don't know.  It just went dead.  Trinity listens to the dead line and takes out the cellular.    It's Tank!  He's alive.  Cypher lunges for Neo's plug just as Tank BLOWS his head off.    Yeah.  Right.    What are they doing to him?   How?   How much time?   The access codes to Zion.   You need help.  I'm coming with you.   Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something that I'm not.   I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle told me.  Trinity is stunned.   She said I had a gift but I still had a lot to learn.  She told me maybe next life.   Why?  It wouldn't mean anything. He'd still believe what he wanted to believe.  But Morpheus is the one that matters.  He's more important than me and we both know it.  He straps in.   I may not be what Morpheus thinks I am, but if I don't try to help him, then I'm not even what I think I am.   His friend.   Yeah?  He snap cocks an Uzi.   That's why it's going to work.   There is no spoon.  Neo whips out his gun and presses it to the cable, lower than where they attached themselves.  BOOM!  The CABLE SNAPS.  The counter-weights plummet, yanking Trinity and Neo up through the shaft as --  The elevator falls away beneath them, distending space, filling it with the sound of WHISTLING METAL as they soar to the top.    Trinity!  Agent Jones charges.   ... help.  His GUN BOOMS as we enter the liquid space of --  Bullet-time.  The AIR SIZZLES with wads of lead-like angry flies as Neo twists, bends, ducks just between them.  Agent Jones still running, narrows the gap, the BULLETS coming faster until --  Neo bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder.  He starts to scream as another digs a red groove across his thigh.  He has only time to look up, to see the barrel when Agent Jones, standing over him, pulls the TRIGGER the final time.  CLICK.  Empty.  Neo rolls, reaching for another gun when around-house kick snaps his jaw.  Agent Jones grabs the gun and levels it at Neo.   Thanks.   I'm fine.  Neo is already looking at the helicopter.   Can you fly that thing?   Get up, Morpheus!  Get up!  Morpheus sits unmoving, his head still down.  Neo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into the adjoining room.  He attaches only one end to his harness when they OPEN  He won't make it.  Morpheus lunges, out of control --  As Neo spins, every move a whip crack --  Snapping the other rope-end onto a bolted bar.  Morpheus begins to fall when Neo hurls himself into the wide blue empty space --  Flying for a moment.  The rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord attached to a machine.  As their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other on a seemingly magnetic course until --  They collide.  Almost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs, scrambling, hands searching in furious desperation, finding hold and clinging.  Until the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their fragile embrace.  Morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over, falling down --  The ground deliriously distant --  As Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed wrist.   Gotcha!  Trinity is already pulling the copter up and away.  As Agent Smith grabs the M-16 from the nearest marine.  He'll bring them all down.  Targeting the helicopter, he aims at something only he can see: the oil line.  PONK.  PONK.  PONK.  The rear HULL is PUNCHED full of holes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood.   Oh fuck.  Trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the nearest building.  Morpheus and Neo cling to one another as they and the machine above them begin to fall.  The ENGINE GRINDS, the CHOPPING BLADES start to slow while --  The Agents stand in the open shattered window, watching the helicopter disappear behind taller buildings.  Carried by its nomentum, Trinity guides the parabolic fall over the nearest roof where --  Neo and Morpheus drop safely, rolling free as the rope goes slack.  Neo gets to his feet, trying to detach himself but --  The helicopter is falling too fast, arcing over the roof like a setting sun --  The coils of slack snap taught --  Yanking Neo off his feet, dragging him with ferocious speed towards the edge even as --  Trinity lunges for the back door, her gun in one hand, grabbing for the rope with the other --  Neo flies like a skipping stone, hurtling straight AT us, when his feet hit the rain gutter --  A fulcrum that levers him up just as --  Trinity FIRES, severing the cord from the HELICOPTER, falling free of it as it SMASHES, blades first into a glass skyscraper.  Holding onto the rope she swings, connected to Neo, who stands on the building's edge watching her arc beneath him as the HELICOPTER EXPLODES --  She bounces against a shatterproof window that spider- cracks out while FLAMES ERUPT behind her.    Morpheus, I know you won't believe me but the Oracle told ne I'm not the One.   Don't!  The Old Man stops, Neo rushes at hin, gliding smoothly over the turnstiles.   Get outta here.  Okay?  Run!  Go!  The Old Man nods, turns and hurries deeper into the urban cave, disappearing into the shadows as Trinity and Morpheus arrive.   It was nobody.  Neo turns to the RINGING BOOTH.   Let's go!  You first, Morpheus.  Morpheus gets in and answers the phone.  Lost in the shadow, the Old Man turns back and watches as Morpheus disappears, the phone dropping, dangling by its cord.  His eyes grow wide, glowing white in the dark.    I believe...  He stares at the fullness of her lips.   I want to kiss you.  She smiles.   So are you.  The smile falls.  Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER.   I already have.  He attacks with a vicious series of blows but the Agent seems to absorb them, waiting for his opening.  And this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.    My name is Neo.  Impossibly, he hurls himself straight up, smashing Smith against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel.  They fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES INTO the station.  Neo back-flips up off the tracks just as --  The train barrels over Agent Smith.  Neo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its emergency brake.  With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of TORTURED RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the station.  Neo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the escalator --  As the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last car open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his glasses again intact.    Mr. Wizard, Get me the fuck out of here!    Hurry, Tank!  I got some serious pursuit!    I'm trying, Trinity.  I'm trying.   Hi.  It's me.  I know you're out there.  I know you're working as fast as you can to catch me.  We CLOSE IN ON the racing columns of numbers shimmering across the screen.   I thought I should call and let you know how things stand.  We DIVE THROUGH the numbers, surging UP THROUGH the darkness, sucked TOWARDS a tight constellation of stars.   I know you're real proud of this world you've built, the way it works, all the nice little rules and such, but I've got some bad news.  We realize that the constellation is actually the holes in the mouthpiece of a phone.  Seen from inside.   I've decided to make a few changes.  We SHOOT THROUGH the holes as Neo hangs up the phone.  He steps out of the phone booth and starts walking, wearing a long black coat and dark glasses.  He passes a mother dragging her little BOY, who cranes his neck as --  Neo takes off, flying up into the air.",
        "Cypher": "Let's see.  Target left work at  He caught the northbound Howard line. Got off at Sheridan. Stopped at 7-11.  Purchased six- pack of beer and a box of Captain Crunch.  Returned home.  The area code is identified.  The first three numbers suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.  We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like the wheels of a slot machine.   Do you know when we're going to make contact?   Just between you and me, you don't believe it, do you?  You don't believe this guy is the one?   I know.  But what about you?   Yeah, but if he's wrong --  The final number pops into place --   Hear what?   Yeah, course I'm sure.  We MOVE STILL CLOSER, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green numbers GROWING INTO an OMINOUS ROAR.   Yeah.  Right.  See you on the other side.  She hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the netherworld of the computer screen.  Where gradually the sound of a police radio grows around us.   Shit.   Morpheus, I know what you believe but I think this is a mistake. We're rushing him.  He's old.  I'm afraid he might pop.   I knew it, I knew it...   He's gonna pop!   He's going to pop!  Vomiting violently, Neo pitches forward and blacks out.    Everyone falls, right, Trinity?  But Trinity has left.  Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out.  He tries to move and groans, cradling his ribs.  While Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand.   Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the bejeezus out of ne.   No, it's all right.   Midnight watch.  Neo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens that seem alive with a constant flow of data.   The Matrix?  Yeah.  The monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations.   You want a drink?  He pours Neo a drink from a large plastic jug.   I'll tell you, I feel for you, man.  I really do.  Most of us were still young, just punks, when Morpheus jacked us.  But you, you had a real life.  Neo takes a sip and it almost kills him.  Cypher pounds on his back.   Good shit, huh?  Dozer makes it. It's good for two things: degreasing engines and killing brain cells.  Red-faced, Neo finally stops coughing.   Did he tell you why he did it?  Neo nods.   I'll be the didn't tell you that this wasn't the first time he thought he found the One.  Neo shakes his head as Cypher fills his cup and laughs.   Let me give you a piece of advice. Between you and me, if Morpheus says you can fly, I wouldn't go jumping out any windows to find out if he's right.  Understand?  Cypher raises his drink.  Neo swallows another throat- scorching mouthful.   Welcome to the real world!    That's what he said to me nine years ago.  The meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing red juice from the inside, that it could be a dream.   The real world.  Ha, what a joke.  We recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh.   You know what real is?  I'll tell you what real is.  A fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the face of Cypher.   Real is just another four-letter word.  He laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth.  The restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago skyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu has no prices.  Sitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith.   Mmm, so, so fucking good.  Smith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his mouth.   You know, I know that this steak doesn't exist.  I know when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious.  After nine years, do you know what I've realized?  Pausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork.  He pops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef melting in his mouth.   Ignorance is bliss.   I don't want to remember nothing. Nothing!  You understand?  And I want to be rich.  Someone important.  Like an actor.  You can do that, right?   All right.  You get my body back in a power plant, reinsert me into the Matrix and I'll get you what you want.   I told you, I don't know them. But I can give you the man who does.   That's what they changed.  We're trapped.  There's no way out.  The sound of heavy BOOT-STEPS close around them with the mechanical sureness of a vice.   I need an exit!  Fast!   There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  They're all dead.  I still got the shakes but, Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.    Just get me outta here.    An actor.  Definitely.    Goddamn gas.  My lungs are killing me.  He crosses to an overhead bin.   We got any pain killers?   Hello, Trinity.   He had an accident.   You know, for a long time, I thought I was in love with you, Trinity.  I used to dream about you...  He nuzzles his face against hers, feeling the softness of it.   You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.  We INTERCUT BETWEEN the appliance store and the main deck.   In a way you're very lucky.  Most people never know why they die. One minute they're alive, the next they're dead.  No warning. Nothing.  That's why I thought maybe I should tell you.  It seemed the least I could do.  He stands over the body of Morpheus, as his anger boils up out of him.   You see, the truth, the real,truth is that the war is over.  It's been over for a long time.  And guess what?  We lost!  Did you hear that?  We lost the war!   Zion?  Zion is a part of this delusion.  More of this madness. That's why this has to be done. It has to end.  Now and forever.  She suddenly sees the entire dark plan.   You see, Trinity, we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here.  It's in the Matrix.   Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die.  He grabs hold of the cable in Apoc's neck, twists it and yanks it out.   You tell me which is more real.  Apoc seems to go blind for an instant, a scream caught in his throat, his hands reaching for nothing, and then falls dead.  Switch screams.   Welcome to the real world, right?  He laughs.   Pay for it?  I'm not even going to remember it.  It'll be like it never happened.  The tree falling in the forest.  It doesn't make a sound.  His hand slides around the neck of Switch as he takes hold of her plug.  She suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she is murdered.   Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove that the message is true.  He stands over Neo.   If Morpheus was right, then there's no way I can pull this plug, is there?  She turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is next.   If he is the One, then in the next few seconds there has to be some kind of miracle to stop me. Because if he dies like the others that means Morpheus was wrong. How can he be the One if he's dead?  He takes hold of the cord when --  She hears an EXPLOSION and a scream.  Cypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the knee.  He rolls over and finds Tank on the ground, and the sights of the plasma rifle.",
        "Brown": "Where are they?    Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions.   How?   What were you doing?  Agent Smith recovers, replacing his ear piece.   They are actually attacking.    The trace was completed.   The extermination unit is in place.   He's gone.  Agent Smith smiles, standing over him.",
        "Trinity": "All right, you're relieved.  Use the usual exit.   Soon.  Only two thin digits left.   I think Morpheus believes he is.   I think Morpheus knows things that I don't.   Did you hear that?   Are you sure this line is clean?   I better go.   Shit.    Morpheus!  The link was traced!  I don't know how.   Are there any agents?   Goddamnit!   All right --   Get up, Trinity.  You're fine. Get up -- just get up!  She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.    Hello, Neo.   I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.   My name is Trinity.   That was a long time ago.   What?   Most guys do.  Neo is a little embarrassed.   No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.  The MUSIC is so loud they must stand very close, talking directly into each other's ear.   I had to gamble that you would see and they wouldn't.   I can't explain everything to you. I'm sure that it's all going to seem very strange, but I brought you here to warn you, Neo.  You are in a lot of danger.   They're watching you.  Something happened and they found out about you.  Normally, if our target is exposed we let it go.  But this time, we can't do that.   You came here because you wanted to know the answer to a hacker's question.   Twelve years ago I met a man, a great man, who said that no one could be told the answer to that question.  That they had to see it, to believe it.  Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.   He told me that no one should look for the answer unless they have to because once you see it, everything changes.  Your life and the world you live in will never be the same.  It's as if you wake up one morning and the sky is falling.  There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels the words like a drug, seeping into him.   The truth is out there, Neo.  It's looking for you and it will find you, if you want it to.  She takes hold of him with her eyes.   That's all I can tell you right now.  Good-bye, Neo.  And good luck.   You know who.  She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall of bodies.  A SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music, pressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --   Shit.   We got him.  Call the chop-shop.  She hangs up.   Listen to me, Neo.  You have to, trust us.  She tears off a long strip of black duct-tape and reaches for his face.   This has to be done for your protection and ours.  She seals his eyes shut with the tape.   You can't understand right now, but if you're not one of us, you're one of them.    Hello, Gizmo.  Neo hears the voices around him.   Yeah.   Are you going to help us or aren't you?   We think you're bugged.  We can't take you to Morpheus until you're clean.   What's happening?   Do something!   Are you crazy?  That will kill him.  We watch Neo, who can't see what they are talking about.   Clear.   Neo, are you okay?  He nods.   It's over.  We got it.  Hanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire- tap.   Thanks for your help, Gizmo.   Gizmo, you don't have the hardware to handle this software.  He howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away. Trinity turns to Neo.   Let's go.  He's waiting.    This is it.  Neo can hear his own heart pounding.   Let me give one piece of advice. Be honest.  He knows more than you can possibly imagine.    I knew he would.  Cypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone away from, Neo.   It's going into replication.   I got a fibrillation!   He's going into arrest!   Far from it.   Easy, Neo.  Easy.  Dozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it.  Once it's out, he tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the harness.   Come on.    Neo, I saved you some dinner --  She sees him passed out on the bed.  She sets the tray down and pulls the blanket over him.  She pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly, breathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away.  It seems the moment she closes the door, he wakes with a start, unsure of where he is.  After a moment, he gets out of bed.    Yeah.   Lots of things.   Some of them.   There's no point in worrylng. Whatever is going to happen is going to happen.  They cross the old lobby.  Switch and Apoc stop at the doors.   Here they come.    What did you just say?   What happened?  What did you see?   How much like it?  Was it the same cat?   A deja vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.  She also listens as the staccato BEAT of HELICOPTER BLADES GROW ominously LOUDER.    Oh, God.    They'll be able to track it.   Morpheus, don't --   We need a phone.    Tank, it's me.    We need an exit!   Cypher, I thought --   Got it.  She hangs up.    You first,.Neo.  Neo answers the phone when there is a CLICK.  There is no signal.  Nothing but silence.   What happened?   Cypher?  Where's Tank?   An accident?  What about Dozer? Is Dozer there?    You killed them.   What about Zion?   Oh rny God.  This is abzut Zion. You gave them Morpheus for the access codes to Zion.  Cypher walks away from Morpheus and bends down next to Apoc's body.   The Matrix isn't real!   Somehow, some way, you're going to pay for this.   Goddamn you, Cypher!   We should, we should hurry.   Tank, you're hurt.   Dozer?  Tank's face tightens.   I'm sorry, Tank.    Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!   No!   I'm going in after him.   If he does I'm sure you'll do what has to be done.   No.  No, I don't think you do.  If you did, then you would know that I'm not letting him go.  Not without a fight, Tank.  She yanks her harness tight.   Not without a fight.    What do you think you're doing?   No.  No way.  Morpheus sacrificed himself so you could escape. There's no way you're going back in.   What?   Did you tell Morpheus?   What are you?   Guns.  Lots of guns.   No one has ever done anything like this.   Dodge this, motherfucker!  BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The body flies back with a flash of mercurial light and when it hits the ground --  It is the pilot.  Trinity helps Neo up.   You're hit --   Not yet.  She pulls out a cellular phone.    Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.  Tank is immediately searching the disk drawers.   Hurry!  His fingers flash over the gleaming laser disks, finding one that he feeds into Trinityls supplement drive, punching the \"load\" cormands on her keyboard.    Let's go.    Shit-shit-no!  Neo is pulling Morpheus up to him when he hears the  Morpheus!  She runs at him, throwing her arms around him.   Tank, get us out of here.   See ya soon.  LINE GOES DEAD.  Tank looks at the bodies and smiles.   What happened?  Was that --   Morpheus is right, you know.  It doesn't matter what he believes or even what the Oracle believes. What matters is what you believe.   I want to kiss you too...  The PHONE begins to RING.   But I want it to be real.  She pulls herself away and gets into the booth when something catches Neo's eye and he looks to where the Old Man had been.  She hears him SCREAM and sees Agent Smith emerge as if formed by congealing darkness, charging with a fistful of metal.  The GUN FIRES, the BULLET flying at her, BURSTING through the plastic WINDOW just as --  Trinity disappears.  The handset hanging in the air as the BULLET HITS, SHATTERING the EAR-PIECE.    Neo!   An Agent!  You have to send me back!   Jesus, he's killing him!    Send me back, Tank!  Anywhere!   What is it... oh no.  In every pipe surrounding them, they see the Extermination Unit.   Sentinels.    You can't use that until Neo is out!   Neo, you better get your ass back here!    Where is he?   Hurry, Neo.    No-no-no!  Neo, you're not dead! You can't be dead!    You're right here.  I'm holding you, Neo.  I'm not letting you go. Do you hear me?  I won't let you go.    Goddamnit, Neo!  Don't give it up! Not now!  She pounds on his chest.   Not now!    Now get up!    Now!  He turns the key.    Neo?  His eyes open.  Tears pour from her smiling eyes as he reaches up to touch her.  And she kisses hin; it seems like it might last forever.",
        "Oracle": "It looks like a suburban tract house.  There is a lot of cozy furniture, a dining roon hutch filled with china, shelves and tables crowded with doilies, knick-knacks and ceramic brick-a-brack.  Neo follows the plastic carpet runner to the kitchen.  A WOMAN is huddled beside the oven, peering inside through the cracked door.   I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.   Bingo.  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers.  It's really a relief.  All that pomp and circumstances just plain tucker me out.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?   I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.   The vase.   I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.   What's really going to bake your noodle later on is, would you still have broken it if I hadn't said anything.  Smiling, she lights a cigarette.   You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.   Not too bright, though.  She winks.   You know why Morpheus brought you to see me?   So? What do you think?  You think you're the one?   You know what that means?  It's Latin.  Means, 'Know thyself.'  She puts her cigarette down.   Well, let's have a look at you.  She widens his eyes, checks his ears, then feels the glands in his neck.   Open your mouth.  Say, 'ahhh.'  She nods then looks at his palms.   Hmmm.  You sure got the gift, but it's tricky.  I'd say the bad news is, you're not the one.  Still got a lot to learn.  Maybe next life.   Same as the bad news, you're not the one.   No.  Here.  She picks up the tray of cooling cookies.   You better take a cookie.  Got a big day ahead of you.  He eyes her, then takes a cookie.   Make a believer out of you yet.",
        "Jones": "Their next target.  The name is Neo.  The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground, separated in the crash like a severed limb.   It's already begun.  We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER and CLOSER, UNTIL the smooth gray plastic spreads out like a horizon and the small HOLES WIDEN until we fall through one --  Swallowed by the darkness that becomes --  A computer screen.  We are on-line, inside a chat room called \"The Matrix.\" It is an exklusive web-site where hackers hang out.   The others were lost.   There is a problem.  Reagan has failed to secure the hardware.  Agent Smith stares out the window.   But if Reagan has failed, why haven't they pulled the plug?   Or he doesn't know.   You don't know.   I think they're trying to save him.    Lower level --   Only human...  Suddenly Agent Jones stops.  Something is wrong.  He scans the roof.  Trinity is gone.  Immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the muzzle of her .45 --  Jammed right into his head.   Remain at your posts.   You will do as you are ordered!   We have their position.   Order the strike.  Agent Smith can't stand listening to them.  He moves to the edge of the building, looking out at the surrounding city.",
        "Mouse": "Morpheus is fighting Neo!  All at once they bolt for the door.    You ever seen anyone that fast that soon, Tank?   I don't believe it!    No one's ever made their first jump.   What does it mean?   Welcome to Movie-Phone.   Right.  The phone flips shut as he jumps up.   Let's get to work.    Yeah...  The CELLULAR RINGS.    What's going on?",
        "Rhineheart": "You have a problem, Mr. Anderson. You think that you're special. You believe that somehow the rules do not apply to you.  He stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo, who turns in time.   Obviously, you are mistaken.  His long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.   This company is one of the top software companies in the world because every single employee understands that they are a part of a whole.  Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem.  He turns again.   The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson.  Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth, or you choose to find yourself another job.  Do I make myself clear?",
        "Dozer": "He needs a lot of work.   There he is.   System check looks fine.  Cypher stands, a raspy cough spewing from his lungs.    You okay?   The first aid kit's over here.  As Dozer stoops for a cabinet, Cypher pulls back a heavy blanket exposing a plasma rifle.    No!  Tank spins as red hot wads of PLASMA EXPLODE through his chair and into his back.  Diving, a second BURST tears up his side --  As Dozer shoots a look at the monitor where Tank was working.  He stabs the enter command activating the exit sequence and ducks under a BARRAGE of PLASMA FIRE-",
        "Morpheus": "I know.  Stay calm.   Yes.   You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Laxe.  You can make it.  She takes a deep breath, centering herself.   Go.  She drops the phone.    Hello, Neo.  This is Morpheus.  Neo's knees give and he falls into his chair.   I had hoped for this conversation to take place under less adverse conditions, but you can never count on hope, can you, Neo?   I've been watching you, Neo, and I want to meet you.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo.  And I'm not sure what they're going to do.   Stand up and see for yourself.   Yes.  Now.  Neo starts to stand.   Do it slowly.  Slowly.  The elevator.  His head slowly peeks up over the partition.  At the elevator, he sees Agent Brown and Agent Jones leading a group of cops.  A female employee turns and points out Neo's cubicle.  Neo ducks.   Yes.  One cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the agents.   I'm not sure.  But, if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.   I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.  The agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.   The cubicle across from you is empty.   Go!  Now!  Neo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle just as the agents turn into his row.  Neo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone tightly to him.   Stay here for a moment.  The agents enter Neo's empty cubicle.  A cop is sent to search the bathroom.  Morpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.   A little longer...  Brown is talking to the tall employee.   When I tell you, go to the end of the row to the first office on the left, stay.as low as you can.  Sweat trickles down his forehead.   Now.  Neo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around.  Staying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING across the opening to the first office on the left.  The room is empty.   Good.  Now there is a window. Open it.   The answer is coming, Neo.  He opens the window.  The window howls into the room.   Outside, there's a scaffold.  You can use it to get to the roof.  Leaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is several offices away.   There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.  Neo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a concrete chasm.   Don't be controlled by your fear, Neo.  There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold.  The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.  CLICK.  He hangs up.  Neo looks at the door, then back at the scaffold.   This line is tapped, so I must be brief.   They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.  Neo feels sick.   I don't know what you are thinking right now but I want you to understand that I will not give up on you until you give up on me.  Neo's throat cracks, dry as the Sahara.   Do you still want to meet?   Take the Howard line south.  CLICK.  He closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done.    At last.  He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible behind circular mirrored glasses.  He strides to Neo and they shake hands.   Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.   Please.  Come.  Sit.  He nods to Trinity.   Thank you, Trinity.  She bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an adjacent room.  They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy- leather chairs.   I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?   I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.  A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.   Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?   Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?   Why not?   I know exactly what you mean.  Again, that smile that could cut glass.   Let me tell you why you are here. You are here because you have the gift.   I've watched you, Neo.  You do not use a computer like a tool.  You use it like it was part of yourself.  What you can do inside a computer is not normal.  I know. I've seen it.  What you do is magic.  Neo shrugs.   But it is, Neo.  It is.  How else would you describe what has been happening to you?  He leans forward.   We are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and logical.  Have you ever wondered why?  Neo shakes his head.   As children, we do not separate the possible from the impossible which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a mind like yours can be very difficult.   From the Matrix.  Neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of himself.   Do you want to know what it is, Neo?  Neo swallows and nods his head.   It's that feeling you have had all your life.  That feeling that something was wrong with the world.  You don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad, driving you to me.  But what is it?  The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.   The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window, or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.   That you are a slave, Neo.  That you, like everyone else, was born into bondage... ... kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch.  A prison for your mind.  Outside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass.   Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.  You have to see it for yourself.   Hold out your hands.  In Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill.   This is your last chance.  After this, there is no going back.  In his left, a blue pill.   You take the blue pill and the story ends.  You wake in your bed and you believe whatever you want to believe.  The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.   You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.  Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the moisture growing in his palms.   Remember that all I am offering is the truth.  Nothing more.  Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The Cheshire smile returns.   Follow me.  He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with high-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green from the racks of monitors.  Trinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter.   Haven't I always told you, Cypher, not to let fear control your life. Apoc, are we on-line?  Neo recognizes the large man from the El train.   Neo, time is always against us. Will you take a seat there?  In the center of the room sits a chair.  Near the chair is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked.   I imagine you know sonething about virtual reality.  Neo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode disks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck.   Tell me about it.   If the virtual reality apparatus, as you called it, was wired to all of your senses and controlled them completely, would you be able to tell the difference between the virtual world and the real world?   No, you wouldn't.  Neo whispers to Trinity.   The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's going to make things feel a bit strange.  Distantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING on a KEYBOARD.  Sweat beads his face.  His eyes blink and twitch when he notices the mirror.  Wide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the mirror were becoming liquid.   Just relax, Neo.  The strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away, until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break.  With the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes of electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and fade.  He looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored icicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running like wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms where he sees his face reflected.   Apoc?   Tank, we're going to need the signal soon.  Stay calm, Neo.  The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up his arns like hundreds of insects.   Shit!  Apoc?  Streams of mercury run from Neo's nose.   Now, Tank now!  His eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a high-pitched ELECTRIC SCREAM ERUPTS in the headphones --  It is a piercing SHRIEK like a computer calling to another computer --  Neo's body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were pulled into the holes of the phone  Sucked into his SCREAM and swallowed by darkness.    Welcome to the real world, Neo.  Neo passes out.   I know.  Dozer and Morpheus are operating on Neo.   Your muscles have atrophied. We're rebuilding them.  Fluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright.   You've never used them before.  Morpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on Neo. Neo lays back.   Rest, Neo.  The answers are coming.    More important than what is when?   You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197. I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.  The wind is knocked from Neo's chest.   I promised you the truth, Neo, and the truth is that the world you were living in was a lie.   I'll show you.    This is my ship, the Nebuchadnezzar.  It's a hovercraft.  Small like a submarine.  It's dark.  It's cramped and cold.  But it's home.  They climb a ladder up to the main deck.    This is the main deck.  You know most of my crew.  Trinity smiles and nods.   The ones you don't know.  That's Mouse and Switch.  The two big guys are Tank and Dozer.  The names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo.   And this, this is the Core.  This is where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix.  It is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment.  Vines of coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic battery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks of little systems and computer monitors.  At the center of the web, there are six ectoskeleton chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness.  Near the circle of chairs is the control console and operator's station where the network is monitored.   Help him, Trinity.  Neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs.   Do you remember when I asked you about an apparatus that could turn a virtual reality into reality?  Neo nods.   It's right here.  He touches Neo's head.   And it's accessed here.  Neo feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack at the back of his neck.  The cable has the same kind of cerebellum chip we saw inside the plant.   This will feel a little weird.  There are several disturbing NOISES as he works the needle in.  We MOVE IN as Neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens into a grimace until a loud CLICK fires and his ears pop like when you equalize them underwater.  He relaxes, opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling of weightlessness inside another place --    This is the Construct.  Startled, Neo whips around and finds Morpheus now in the room with him.   It is our loading program.  We can load anything from clothes, to weapons, to training simulations. Anything we need.  Morpheus walks past Neo and when Neo turns he sees the two leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a large-screen television.   Sit down.  Neo stands at the back of the chair as Morpheus sits.   Wild, isn't it?  Neo's hands run over the cracked leather.   What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.  He picks up a remote control and clicks ON the TELEVISION.  We drift through the Windy City circa 1996.   This is the Chicago you know. Chicago as it was at the end of the twentieth century.  This Chicago exists only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix.  We GLIDE AT the television as he changes the channel.   You have been living inside Baulliaurd's vision, inside the map, not the territory.  This is Chicago as it exists today.  The sky is an endless sea of black and green bile.  The earth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out beneath us as we ENTER the television.   'The desert of the real.'  In the distance, we see the ruins of a future Chicago protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of a long-dead corpse.   We are, right now, miles below the earth's surface.  The only place humans can survive outside the Matrix is underground.  Still MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert. Dizzy, Neo holds onto the chair.   It started early in the twenty- first century, with the birth of artificial intelligence, a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines.  In his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather.   At first all they wanted was to be treated as equals, entitled to the same human inalienable rights. Whatever they were given, it was not enough.  In the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light up a bloody battle field.   We don't know who struck first. Us or them.  But sometime at the end of the twenty-first century the battle was joined.  We MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us.   The war raged for generations and turned the face of our planet from green and blue to black and red.  At last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are at once terrifying and beautiful.  They have an organic architecture like a microbiotic organism, that is perpetually in motion.  The Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier, splitting open the soft, stearing meat inside.   It scorched and burned the sky. Without the sun, the machines sought out a new energy source to survive.  The Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink bursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud of stain.   They discovered a new form of fusion.  All that was required to initiate the reaction was a small electric charge.  Throughout human history we have been dependent on machines to survive.  Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.  We return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where we see human beings looking almost blissful in their gelatin cocoons.   The human body generates more bio- electricity than a 120-volt battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s of body heat.  Outside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a breathing greenhouse, are the growing fields.   We are, as an energy source, easily renewable and completely recyclable, the dead liquified and fed intravenously to the living.  Huge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop.   All they needed to control this new battery was something to occupy our mind.  We see inside a clear tubular husk.  Floating in viscous fluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already growing around the brain-jack.   And so they built a prison out of our past, wired it to our brains and turned us into slaves.  We PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television and we are again inside the white space of the Construct.   I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.  The room without walls begins to spin.   No.  But if you could, would you really want to?  Neo isn't sure of that answer.   I feel that I owe you an apology. There is a rule that we do not free a mind once it reaches a certain age.  It is dangerous. They have trouble letting go.. Their mind turns against them. I've seen it happen.  I broke the rule because I had to.  He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to himself as Neo.   When the Matrix was first built there was a man born inside that had the ability to change what he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.  It was this man that freed the first of us and taught us the secret of the war; control the Matrix and you control the future.  He pauses.   When he died, the Oracle at the temple of Zion prophesied his return and envisioned an end to the war and freedom for our people.  That is why there are those of us that have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix, looking for him.  Neo can feel his eyes on him.   I did what I did, because I believe we have been brought here for a reason, Neo.  You are here to serve a purpose, just as I am here to serve mine.   But I do, Neo.  I do.  He stands up.   Get some rest.  You're going to need it.   Your training.     How is he?  Tank looks at his watch, rubs his eyes.   Show me.    This is a sparring program, similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix.  Consider this your first lesson.  He assumes a fighting stance.   Attack me.  Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack.  It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack --  But each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed.    Good.  Adaption.  Improvisation. But your weakness isn't your technique.  Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen. His feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart.  For every blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --  Neo falls.  Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his mouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo.   How did I beat you?   Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?  Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.   Do you believe that's air you are breathing now?  Neo squints at him.   If you can free your mind, the body will follow.  Neo stands, nodding.   Again.  Their fists fly with  pneumatic speed.    You are angry with me.  Neo pants.   It's all right.  It's natural.   Good, good.  Anger is a gift, Neo, but it's a heavy one.  Morpheus smiles.   Tank, load the jump program.  Neo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain lifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building rooftop in a city skyline.   You have to learn to let go of that anger.  You must let go of everything.  A WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side.   You must empty yourself to free your mind.  Morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop. And jumps.  He sails through the air, his coat billowing out behind him like a cape --  Somersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the street.   Everyone falls the first time.  Neo nods quietly.   If you never know failure, how can you know success?    The body cannot live without the mind.    How's he doing?   Good.  I want everyone alerted to 12-hour stand-by.  We're going in. Neo, it's time for you to know why you're here.  Morpheus walks away.   We're in.  He hangs up.   Mouse and Cable hold the exit. Let's go.    We should be back in an hour.    Do you now understand what it means when we say, if you're not one of us, you're one of them?   Anyone that is still in a power plant.  That is why we try to be invisible in the Matrix.   You're looking well, Mojo.  Mojo coughs a brown, cankerous laugh, juice speckling his chin and shirt.  He stares at Neo.   This is the temple.  It is a part of Zion's mainframe.  It's hidden inside the Matrix so that we can access it.  Two PRIESTESSES are waiting in the antechamber.   Okay, you're on your own.  Go with them.  They take Neo by the arm, leading him down a hall into another room.   You don't have to tell me anything, Neo, because I already know what she said.   I brought you so that you could hear it for yourself.  I knew it would help.  Neo finishes his cookie.   No one will ever ask you because it is a gift from her.  It is for you and you alone.    Come on!    Give me your phone.   We have no choice.    Tank, find a structural drawing of this building and find it fast.  His fingers pound the keyboard.    I need the main wet-wall.    Good.  He cuts off the phone.    Come on!  Cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him.    You have to get Neo out. Understand?  That's all that matters now.   He must get out.  Do you understand me?  She nods.  A font of water erupts as Morpheus leaps for the manhole ladder, his coat flying open like the wings of a manta ray.   And you are?   You all look the same to me.   Oh, so have I.  Agent Smith smiles.    I already have.  He stands up and drops his fists; a steely resolve in his eyes.   I knew it!  I goddamn knew it!   Do you believe me now?  He's the One!  Who else could have done this?   It doesn't matter if I don't believe you --  His eyes light up.   What matters is that you don't believe her.    I know.  Don't worry, he'll make it.    Do it!    He's going to make it.",
        "Tank": "Morning.  Did you sleep?   You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.  He offers his hand and Neo shakes it.  He notices that Tank doesn't have any jacks.   Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world.  Genuine child of Zion.   Zion is the place, man.  You'll see it one day.  Last human city. All we got left.  Tank smiles.   Goddamn, I got to tell you I'm fairly excited to see what you are capable of.  I mean if Morpheus is right and all.  We're not supposed to talk.about any of that, but if you are, well then this is an exciting time.  We got a lot to do so let's get to it.    We're supposed to load all these operations programs first, but this is some major boring shit. Why don't we start something a little fun?  Tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair.  He begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro discs.   How about sore combat training?  Neo reads the label on the disk.   Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?   Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.  Neo's body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open, breath hissing from his lips.  He looks like he just orgasmed.  He locks at Morpheus.   Never.   It's never been done.  Trinity stares at the screen, her fists clenching as she whispers.   What?    Good.  Now what's this?  He points to one of Neo's monitors.   What's that?   How about this?   Electromagnetic pulse.  Our best weapon against the machines.  The problem is if someone is still in the Matrix when that thing goes off, they're not coming back.  Neo nods as Morpheus comes up behind them.   We just finished the operation programs and he's showing great retention.   He's taking you into the Matrix to see her.   The Oracle.  Neo looks down at the monitor teeming with Matrix data that seems to coalesce, equations giving way to images as a METAL SCREAM RISES BECOMING --    Weird.  This area never has this much activity.    They're on their way.   Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!    It's a trap!    They cut the hard-line!  It's a trap!  Get out!  Cable yanks open the curtain.   No, no, no.    Got it.   Now left and that's it in front of you.   Nerve gas.    No!    We gotta find the others.  They're still alive.  The PHONE RINGS.   Operator.   Cypher?  I thought they had you?    I got you.   Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.  Cypher hangs up and smiles as the fire trucks arrive.   Operator.   Gotcha.  You're not far from Cypher.   So did we.  That boy's got nine lives.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.   Got him.  Cypher's body twitches in its harness, jerking itself awake.  His eyes blink open.  Dozer unplugs him.   How's it feel, Cypher?  Knowing you're about to die?   I'll be all right.   They're cracking his mind.   They inject virus-like serums to break down the system.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.   Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.  Tank punches several commands on Morpheus' personal unit. The monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an orderly symmetrical one.   When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.   If an agent got inside Zion's mainframe he could do anything. Disable the defense system. It would be the end of us.  He looks up at Trinity who is pacing relentlessly.   We can't let that happen.  We have to do it, Trinity.  Zion has to be protected.  Trinity sees Cypher's dead body.  Rage overtakes her and she starts kicking hin.   We have to pull the plug.   We don't have any other choice.  Those words are like using gasoline to put out a fire and we watch the pain in her eyes burn into a blaze.  She walks past him and gets into her chair.   Trinity, what are you doing?   Morpheus could conform at any minute --   You saw that place.  It's suicide.  She glares at him.   I know what Morpheus means to you --   Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?   Coming right up.  He loads the weapons disk.    Hold on, Morpheus.  They're coming for you.  They're coming.    Operator.   He's the One.  He's got to be...    Got one ready.  An underground El station.  State and Balbo.   See ya soon.    What the hell just happened?   I can't!    I'm looking, Trinity!  I'm looking!  From the cockpit, an ALARM sounds.  Morpheus hurries to the front console, typing, bringing up the radar.  Trinity follows him.   Operator.   I got one!  Neo glances to his right and sees Agent Brown, now driving the car beside his.  Agent Brown swerves, slamming into him.   Wabash and Lake.  A hotel.  Neo fights the steering wheel as Agent Brown pushes the car up over the median.   Room 303.  Neo drops the phone as his car bucks into the opposing lane --  Directly into the charging path of an enormous truck driven by Agent Smith.  Neo dives from the Mercedes as the truck plows into it, rending metal and GLASS, crushing through, totaling other cars, as it EXPLODES.  Neo is up and running even as orange and black clouds billow up behind hin.    I'm going to make the call.   Almost there."
