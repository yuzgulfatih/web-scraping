        "Michael": "God, it must be, what, months, huh?     I can't wait to talk to you.  I'm     in Chicago at the Ritz Carlton...  She looks impressed and surprised.  Fancy place for this guy.       Call me four in the morning,     whatever, we gotta talk.  As she hangs up.  She still has that look in her eye.  Digger has never seen that, and he likes it very much.       Hey! God, it's so good to hear     your voice.  She forgets herself.  Because it's good to hear his, too.       I've been calling for days!       Look, I have to ask you something.  She swallows.       Something so incredibly important,     that if you turn me down, I don't     know what I'll d...       Are you kidding?  Stops her.  Like a brick wall.  The sweetness in his voice.       I think about that night all     the time.  She's going to have a heart attack.       But it's not why I called.  She blinks.  It's not.  And just as a tsunami of relief begins to sweep away...       I called because I met someone.  And her smiles breaks off.  Like a spine snapping.  Because there is something in his voice.       You don't understand.  I've never     felt this way about anybody!  Never.  She sits down, hard.  Right on the floor.       And she's all wrong for me!       I mean she's a junior at Chicago     University, she's twenty years     old! Like when I first met you.  Like when.  Julianne's mouth is suddenly dry.       And her dad is like this billionaire     who owns the White Sox and some cable     empire, and you know how I've always     been miserably awkward around those     kinda stuffed suits...  She's finally making her mouth work...       But they're so down to earth, such     wonderful people...       Well.  Sure.  Wow.       See.  We're getting married.     This Sunday.  There's a knife in her heart.  She can scarcely breathe.       Actually, it all starts tomorrow.     It's one of those four-day weddings,     with all the traditional events, and     ten million people flying in from     Madagascar such.       Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's     letting me do a profile on the Big     Hurt.  That's Frank...       Jules.  I'm scared.  A straw to lunge at.       I need you.  So heartfelt.  A lifetime of emotion welling in her eyes.       If you can't come.  And hold my     hand.  I'll never get through this.  Oh.       Please come, please.       I can't wait for you to meet her!  HOLD ON Julianne.  Staring in the mirror.  Like watching the end of her life.       Can you believe it? Can you believe     I'm actually gonna do this?       Should I turn around, or someth...       We've seen each other a lot     more naked than this.  She seems ready to rip her clothes apart, so he gently takes them from her hands.  She tries to stand unselfconsciously as he easily untangles them.       I mean, we were skinny-dipping     in Greece, just as pals, less     than two years ago.  She GRABS the clothes and covers the front of herself.  Looking at him with a mix of emotions she couldn't begin to sort out.       Well.  I leave with two thoughts     in my mind.  He walks to the door.  Puts his hand on the latch.  Looks back...       You're still a very pretty     girl.  The look holds.  And holds.  There is such feeling on both sides, she doesn't know what to make of it.  She swallows.       Mirrors.  And he's gone.  She looks around at six different VIEWS of her uncovered backside.  Hmm.       Wow!  Lemme give you a ha...       Think of that.  And as well as     I know you.  She goes first to the bodyguard.       Julianne Potter, this is Hank     and Gerry from SI, and you know     Daniel...  She's nodding, flawlessly plucking two beers each from perimeter of the tray, keeping the rest perfectly balanced in the center. Michael is flat dumbstruck.  Next, a tall patrician gentleman with rolled-up sleeves on his hand-stitched silk shirt...       Oh.  This is my father-in-law,     Walter.  Once again, she gracefully plucks two beers for the distinguished father-in-law...       How are you doing this? You're     on drugs.  Sets them down.  The man has a smile wonderful in its ease. Murmurs...       And, this guy, you know...  She sure does, and effortlessly balancing her one-hand load, she dips to kiss a porky, balding guy with big-time shoulders. Straight on the lips.       Dance?  You don't dance!  You     learn to dance??  Her innocent smile.       You're an impostor! What have     you done with my best friend?  As he takes away the remaining beers...       And how was the hot dog?  Hot dog? His eyes fix on her left breast.  HUGE mustard stain. She can't believe it.       Cheap and unnecessary.  We were     looking anyway.       ... see, that's what I thought at     first.  How can you like someone     that perfect? No potential for     long-range livability.  Drinking their beers.  Side by side.  Both stare only at the game.       Luckily.  The closer I watched,     the more the fault came into     focus.  Each imperfection its own     adorable slice of vulnerability.       She's too genuine.       How can you trust someone you     can never mistrust?       No matter how many times I     leave the toilet seat up, she     forgets and puts it down.       My very point.  Here's another one...  Shakes his head.  This one really gets him.       Every day.  She makes the bed.       At first, I thought it was a     gag, but she's always done it!  This is not the ammunition Julianne was hoping for.       She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.       She finds him \"personable.\"       Then again.  She has a few good     traits.  Hating herself for asking, but seeing no way out...       First girl I ever knew.  Who     lets me give her a bath.  The look in his eyes.  She can hardly bear it.       And when I hug her, even in     public.  I don't have to let go     right away.  She lets me hold     her as long as I want.  He seems so deeply in love.       Nice kid, don't you think?  A beat.  A slow nod.  A quiet...       Jesus, one d-back from the Bears     knows a place...       I tried those on.  When you     weren't looking.  Now he's grinning at Julianne.  And she likes that a lot.       Firenze.  Together in the memory.  As Kimmy watches.       Till the gas ran out.  And, the first sniff of left-out...       I travel every week.  College     ball, motor sports, training     camps...       Because I could come...       Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm     cheap, remember?  Turns his head, to see her.  She's still rubbing his shoulder.       The El's right down the street.     Unless you're afraid of the     neighborhood.  She looks around.  It is an issue.  But she remembers...       What, leaving school...       In her way.       No.  Hit a nerve.  This is promising.       She would never.  Never.  Even think     of that.  Paydirt.  Julianne's Geiger Counter is going berserk.       I got the point.  He looks over at her.  No smile on his face.  An edge we haven't seen.  She shrugs...       That would be a girl.  I don't     even know.  They've reached the stairs to the El.  A rickety train RATTLES above them.  As they start up, she slips her arm around his waist...       Wow.  What was going on in     there?  She shudders.       You're not eating.       You never eat when you're     despondent.       Last zoo we were in was...     Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos     were fucking.        Yeah, they were.  They're passing the hippo pen.  But they don't notice.       It's weird being the groom.  All     these things Kimmy has to take     care of...       Now, there's my girl.  ... to tenderness.  PAN back to see her wearing everything from her cardboard container.  Nachos, fudge sauce, Diet Coke, the works. It is really awful.  Kids, bystanders, laughing cruelly.  Her eyes fill with tears, and she tries bravely to smile against it...        See, better already.  And he kisses her face.  Not quite her lips.  But only an inch away. We can feel her heart pounding.  He strips off his shirt, only a tank top underneath.       We'll go back to the bathroom,     you'll put this on...  Okay? She sniffles, okay.  Swallows.       Bet I am.  Holds her close, as they start toward the restroom...       Hope that crazy person's not     still there.  We're on their backs...    Julianne alone in his room, looking around frantically.  No worries about this guy making his bed every day, stuff, clothes, strewn everywhere, the bathroom looks like a cherry bomb just detonated. She's tramping through a bachelor's debris, wearing only her towel, looking, looking...  There it is.  The corner of his LAPTOP sticking out from beneath a discarded bedspread.  She SNATCHES it up, OPENS it, sets it on the cluttered desk, and...  ... stops.  There are wallet-sized SNAPSHOTS of Kimmy.  Some alone. Some as a little girl.  Some with Michael.  And next to them...  ... the plastic fold-out wallet inset.  That he has not yet quite rearranged.  So she picks it up.  Leafs through, until she finds what she was praying would be there...  ... Julianne grinning.  Michael's arm around her.  On the deck of a boat.  They have drinks in their hands.  Happiness in their eyes.  And she stares at it.  Jesus, God, how long has he carried this around?  She flips through further, all the rest have her in them. Maybe half a dozen.  Her heart is throbbing.  Her eyes are damp.  Back to the one on the boat.  She slips it from the plastic window. Holds it.  Then, gently...  ... puts it back where it belongs.  PUNCHES up the goddamn laptop. This is it, girl!  Do or die.       Sure you're okay?  She looks really scared.  Turns her drink in her hand.  Looking down at it.       It's not just a gag, huh?       I wish you'd just... come out     with it.  I mean why are we     waiting for Jules?  She smiles up at him.  The best she can.        Wow and wow.  You have a date,     after this?       You make me think of that song,     we used to...  And he starts humming.  The song is, \"The Way You Look Tonight.\"        Someday.  When I'm awfully low...  They sit.  He looks from Julianne to his bride.       Okay, kid.  You're on.  Kim's eyes flick to Julianne, who nods, supportively.  The kid takes a breath.        He never mentioned that.  Neither     did y...       Like family, huh?  So quiet.  So cold.  She is terrified.       To him.  She swallows.  Straightens her spine.        ... and you knew about this.  Real quiet.  Against the noise of this place.       Well, which is it?  A demand.  Sharp.  Accusing.  She doesn't like that...       You gonna tell me Daddy thought     this one up? All of a sudden, I'm     the only jerk alive who can help     him deal with the press?  She's trapped.  Angry, scared.  A deer in headlights.       Why don't you start being honest     for one fucking sec...       Well, forgive me for screwing up     your plans!  He can't even believe he's hearing this.       I'm sure glad I'm hearing all     this now, before it's too late!       And what am I supposed to do with     my life, huh? I am 28 years old!     I work in a low-paying, low-status,     zero-respect job which,     unfortunately, I happen to fucking     love.  How inconvenient.  Shrugs.       No problem.  A little bullshit     about Daddy's \"needs,\" and presto,     I'm a lap dog in high society.        Does it, really? How come you     never took some sell-out     establishment job? You had plenty     of chances!  Glares in her eyes.       I'll tell you why.  Because that     isn't you.  And it isn't me,     either!  We're the same person!  Back to Kim...       What a sweet little picture.  Mommy     and Daddy aren't losing a daughter,     they're gaining a eunuch!       Damn straight, it's how I feel!     What's their wedding gift, a little     gold collar that says \"Mikey-poo\"?     Or do I have to change my name to \"Binky\"?  She's crying now.  Real tears on her face.       Great!  Tears!  The big equalizer.     You wait till two days before the     wedding to drop this on me, and     I'm just supposed to roll over and     drool!  She is sobbing now.  She can't help herself.  Which makes him totally crazy.  He jumps up.       Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist     asshole, and you're well rid of m...    A wrenching cry from her heart.  It stops him cold.  And before Julianne's astonished eyes, Kimmy reaches out a trembling hand...       You guys are heartless, my     bride picked this out.       Yeah, it's in the contract.       I should look different.       And I'm supposed to respect     your fashion tips, because     you're what, a New Yorker?        Long trip.  Pretty nice of you     to come.       I'm just glad someone finally put     this thing in its proper perspective.  Steals a glance at Julianne.  She rolls her eyes.  What a goofball, my outrageous friend.        Stay, huh?       I'll call George's parents.     Tell them I need a best man who     actually looks after me.  Julianne comes over.        You don't miss much.       Big weddings are so strange.       Kim has all this stuff to do,     I hardly see her.       No.  I've got you.  She nods.  That you have.  Staring in her eyes...       Don't you throw up on boat?       I've been thinking a lot the     last couple days.  About us,     actually.       It's more than that.  That tightens her throat pretty good.  When she tries to speak, out comes a dry CROAK that makes him laugh again.  Softer, this time.       I mean, it's embarrassing to     say it this way, but...  He stops.  Her eyes WIDEN in a burlesque of anticipation.  So he smiles.  She knows how to put him at ease.       You've sort of been... y'know,     the woman in my life.       And I was thinking this could be     our last time.  Alone.  Together.     You know?       Except for that.  She's smiling so easily.  Who would guess her stomach is double- knotted.       I can hardly wait for your     wedding.       Boy, I never thought I'd hear you     say that.  Can I come?  She holds herself together.  Real soft with...       It's normal to have... second     thoughts, huh? To be scared.  Is this a change of direction? Or is it the direction she's been praying for.       I mean, you commit to a wedding.     And then it seems like... this...     momentum, you know?  You forget     you... chose it.  She nods.  Understands.       You and I.  I mean, in all our     relationships with other people...     We didn't use the word \"love\"     a lot, did we?  We didn't.       Kimmy says.  When you love someone.     You say it, you say it out loud.     Right now.  Or the moment...  Long beat.       ... passes you by, yeah.  She's a     smart girl.  Off in distance, the Centennial Fountain SHOOTS an eight-foot JET of water across the river.  For Michael and Julianne it goes unnoticed.       We don't have a song.  Hmm?       Kimmy and I.  We don't have a song.     Is that a bad sign?  All Julianne can do is shrug.  Then...        Someday, when I'm awfully low...       And the world is cold...  She doesn't want to cry.  So she puts all the strength she has into fighting it back.        I will feel a glow just Thinking of you...       And the way you look.  Tonight.  He stops.  Smiles that sweet, boyish smile.       Dance card filled?            With each word, your tenderness grows,       Tearing my fears apart...  She holds him closer.  Bites her lip.        And that laugh       That wrinkles your nose,     Touches my foolish heart.  He stops.  He looks at her.  She's still in his arms.       Where did we first hear th...       So we heard it... like, right     that... that first...       I won't lose you, will I?  Her eyes close.  Then open.  Utterly lost in his.        Takes me back.       Except now you're better-     looking.  Oh, yeah?  Yes, ma'am.  As she loses herself in his eyes...       I got the ring.  He pulls the box from his pocket.  Somewhere, an ORGAN sounds.  And as he is about to hand her the box...       Yeah, Kim told me they were     giving you their Dueling     Scarlet's act.  Actually,     they're sophomores at Juilliard.  She takes the box from his hand.  Opens it, as the singing CONTINUES throughout.  The ring is delicate hammered gold.  One of a kind.       Will she like it?       It's no big deal, she just gave     you the wrong keys that's s...       What is the big deal about     getting this file tonight?  A good question.  She needs a good answer.       Me, too.  I'm getting married     tomorrow.       I forgot how cute you look.  When     you get impossible.       Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing     business.  Crack of dawn, Monday,     Walter'll take you up there...  Her eyes fill with tears.  He is mystified.  Smiles tenderly.        Give it up, kid.  Touches her hair.       You can't win 'em all.  And slowly, he takes her hand.  Leads her way.  She takes one backward glance at the locked door.  Her last dream dies.        Listen up, huh? Even if you blow     this deal, how big could it be?        Jules?  She won't look at him.  She wants to die.  The bell RINGS, the doors open to her floor.  She just walks out.  And he follows.  They stand now, she with her arms crossed, lip trembling.  She can't believe how close she is to losing it.       This thing means that much to     y...       I'll call the house, Walter's     probably not even asleep...  Her mouth drops.  She can't believe this.       I'll drive you out there, we'll     get the key, we'll go back to     the office...  She THROWS her arms around his, HUGGING him so hard, so close.  He laughs, she is so weird.  She pulls back, beaming, glowing.       Come on, we'll call from your     room.  She claps his hand.  As they head down the hall...       If I fall asleep on the altar     tomorrow...  He's trying to flip through the message slips in his free hand...       ... you better be there to...     funny, these are all from Ben.  She's at her door, turning the key.  He looks at the envelope.       The fax is from Ben, too.  Man,     it's my wedding, and my boss can't     leave me alone...        Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing     this to you on the night before     your wedding.  But I think you     need and deserve to know...  And he looks up to her.       ... what you're marrying into.  He hands it toward her.  She takes it, hesitantly, and he walks past. Toward the phone.       Isabelle?  I need to talk to     Kim...       I'm just tired.  Please put her     on?  Thanks.       Jules.  Could you give me a     minute?  He looks more sick than angry.  As if the heart has just been cut out of him.  She doesn't know what to say or do, so she just stands, staring dumbly.       Please?  She nods, stumbles out of her room, closing the door behind her. Now she's in the empty corridor, clutching her big jumbled bag, sinking down to sit on the carpet, her back against the door.  She doesn't look elated.  She seems frightened, distraught, and most of all, confused.  Because she can't understand why.  She digs absently through her bag.  Cigarettes.  Box of matches.  She lights up.  Draws deeply.  Somehow, she seems near tears, and laughs bitterly at that.  Shakes her head at how fucked-up she finds herself.  Squeaking wheels approach, but she is too lost to hear them.        It's over.  And crouches down.  Close beside her.  The cigarette drops from her hand, unnoticed on the carpet.  So he lifts it, crushes it on the heel of his shoe.       I want you to quit this shit,     it'll kill you.  She just nods, obediently.  Okay, I will.       She denied it.  Said I was crazy     and paranoid.       There's this big brunch tomorrow     morning?  At her place.  He lets the air out.  Slow.  So he won't cry.       She said \"How can I call everything     off, what do I tell everybody?\"  Shakes his head.  Can you imagine that?       No, it's for the best, it really     is.  We were so wrong for each     other.       The job thing would have broken     us up, eventually, anyway.  She     couldn't have lived with it.  I     know that now.  Julianne nods.  Maybe that part is right.  Maybe it would have ended anyway.  Maybe she can pretend she's not a monster.        And she's right, I'm crazy to      fall for someone.  I hardly      knew.  Looks deep in her eyes.  He's so glad she's there.       Hey.  You still got that ring?  She holds up her left hand, the flapping sleeve falls away.  The ring is on a finger that is swollen and raw.       I just want to be alone.  Is     that okay?  She nods, sure.  He kisses her cheek.  Stands up.       Maybe I'll go back to New York.     Hang with you for awhile, huh?     Ben'll understand.  She nods again.  Whatever you say.  He steps into the open doorway...       Or we'll go somewhere.  If you     have the time.       Thanks for coming to my wedding.  And then he's gone.       Look, I came down here to face     everybody.  I didn't want to     slink away like some coward...       She hasn't told anybody, what     am I supposed to do?       This is her family and her     fault.        Well.  How come she didn't...       Hey.  This is a serious matter.  Thank you.  She POKES his chest, punctuating...       How is she?  Julianne absorbs this.  As the bizarre SOUNDS continue, she WHIRLS around...       I asked you...       Do you think she still loves     me?  We watch the struggle inside her.  Her voice drops...       I keep asking, how can I explain     what happened? And I keep     getting that same answer all     night long.  Which is...       I can't.  And it doesn't matter.     I drove her to it, because I     want things my way.  And even     if she did something tricky and     unfair... she was blinded by     love, okay?  Julianne swallows.  For obvious reasons.       Love doesn't have to be right.     It just has to be love.  The stoner are now helium-crooning \"Bridge Over Troubled Waters.\" Actually, they're getting better.       She's giving up half her life     for me, and I'm bitching because     it hurts her.       She's a saint!  And I'm a     worthless ingrate!       Tell her.  I'll marry her at six     o'clock, if she'll still have me.  The stoners blend on the high note.  It's pretty moving.        Thank God you were here.       I was so confused, so conflicted,     so... unstable.       I might have thrown away...  Searching for the right words.       ... yeah, that.        Are you okay?  She stops walking.  She can't look at him, so she looks around. Across the lawn crews are moving equipment into the brightly- colored tents, unfolding and setting up stacks of tables and chairs, raising the poles between which all those balloons will be strung.  At the center of it all...  .... a huge topiary White Sox batter, just completing a murderous swing.  He's maybe fifteen feet tall.  She points to it...       Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the     past.  And he likes the little     guys.  So Julianne nods.  Because she does too.  Squints up at Michael.       Kimmy's idea.  She thought it     would be such a romantic place.     For our wedding dance.  Looking down at her.       What's up?       Jules, what's wrong...     He DISAPPEARS behind the train, she FALLS, skids, springs up, pushes through gaping onlookers, almost there, the train PULLS      Uh.  I saw that moving...       You're not saying you actually...     you're saying that y...           I mean, do you realize what     you've... well, of course you     realize, that's why you're     confessing, I mean... I mean...     how could you do that?       Lower.       The pus that infects the mucous     that cruds up the fungus.  And to her amazement.  The trace of a smile...        On the other hand, thank you.  She blinks at that.  Which squeezes out a tear.       For loving me that much, that     way.  He shrugs.  Just above a whisper...       Well, that part I knew.  She's never loved him more.        I'll take it to my grave.  Good.  She looks around.       I came here, looking for her.  For her.  The words leave a silence.       This is where I proposed.  Stares deep in her eyes.  She needs to hear this.       I had to cover a game in     Milwaukee.  She saw me off.     And when the train started to     leave... I jumped up on the     step, I help the handle, and     without...  He grins.  Has to admit...       ... without a thought in my head.     I shouted, \"Marry me.\"  I did.  Now her eyes tear up again.  And she doesn't know why.       And she gasped, and covered her     mouth, and the train was pulling     out, and suddenly she screamed     YES!  Just once.  And blew me a     kiss.  What a girl.       I never forgot that.       Almost three.       I just wonder if you know why.  Do you?       It's because romance isn't     mystery, and tricks, and doubts,     and halting, unspoken longings.     That's not the real romance.  Tears in his eyes now.  First time.       The real romance is saying yes.  Does she know that now?  He looks at his watch.        Woulda been a nice wedding.  Oh.  That.       I'm just thinking of how she's     hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like     her life is over.       If you find her...  Strange tone.  A gentle warning.       The kiss.  May be hard.  For     you to explain.      Because the only fear she     really has, is...       But if you do get to her first...  She looks up.       There is something you are     authorized to say.       Why do people get married     anymore?  And on these words.  We SNAP to Julianne.  Share her interest in the bluntness, the simplicity, the unorthodoxy of this beginning.       Why not live together amicably,     with no sense of obligation     beyond the moment?  Her eyes.  She's listening.       As long as the sex is good.  As     long as no one more interesting     has wandered into view.  As long     as the thousand conflicts of two     individual wills remain     comfortably compromised.  PANNING now.  Other faces.  Isabelle.  Proud to the bone.       And when one feels the urge to     move on, to explore the new.     No guilt, no disgrace, no     promise broken.  Walter.  His eyes damp.  Against our expectation.       No agony of having dishonored     a time.  When our hearts.  And     the world were different.  Joe nods, as he hears...       Marriage is a lot to put up     with.  Julianne once more.  No breath.  Rapt.       The answer must be.  That there     is some need basic to the human     heart.  That embracing... the obligation     of commitment... fulfills.  Her eyes have clouded.  As if Michael is talking to her.       Some need to belong to one another     in a way which rages against the     notion... that all is impermanent.     Against the notion of mortality.  And suddenly, ALL the feeling rises in her throat.       Our love is bigger.  And longer.     Than life itself.  And the tears come.  They come freely, unhidden, unnoticed.  As if they were needed.  Michael now.  Looking at his bride.       That's what we want.  And marriage.     Is what we do about it.  Kimmy smiles at him.  With love bigger than life itself.       We are fools in this.  Thank     God Almighty.  He is done.  There is a silence.       Kimberly.  I promise to love.     And respect and comfort you.     To hear your voice and your     heart.  Until we are parted     by death.  She swallows.  Smiles a fleeting, beautiful smile.  Fumbles slightly, putting the ring on his finger.        I do.  The Minister joins their right hands.       Wherever I go.  However far...  She sobs.  Holds him.  Deep, deep breath.",

Walter and Isabelle clap and call out support.  So Joe lifts his mallet...       Okay, everyone stand up!  And everyone does.  With one exception.  Trapped.  She JAMS her left hand in her coat pocket, SMEARS her right palm sort of clean on the underside of the table, GRABS her mallet and JUMPS UP.

        "Wallace": "Julianne in crisp chalk-stripe trousers and a buttoned-up dress shirt.  Her coat slung over her shoulder, she wanders through the Saturday-deserted office space.  Desks, cubicles, monitors, silent.  A row of executive offices standing empty, waiting for the custodian.  Turning a corner, we hear...  ... life, at the end of the hallway.  A grand conference room with a glass wall.  Walter, in shirtsleeves, running a strategy meeting for five.  DEIDRE, his personal secretary, clicking every word into her laptop at warp speed.  Walter sees Julianne through the glass. A comic take of pleased surprise.  He comes out to greet her...    Julianne climbs from her taxi.  Only slightly in awe, she sets off past the reflecting pool, which fronts a mansion of graceful stone and timber.  It's a hike today, because the circular drives is clogged deep with Bentleys, Mercedes, and waiting limos, vying for space with a score of delivery vehicles of all kinds, maintenance trucks, catering and florist and food vans.    Silence.  From the long line of stalls...    This is what all the preparation was for.  Tables, lights, balloons, the guests dancing on the hardwood floor, at the base of the gazebo. The bride and groom among them, relaxed and happy.  Two who are one.",

She can't read this guy.  Maybe that's how he built an empire.  She nods, yeah.       You're a woman of insight.  He sits on the arm of his chair.  Close enough to speak quietly.       My wife and I love this marriage,     and deplore its circumstances.  He puffs his cigar.  Julianne puffs her.  Kimmy looks on, a kid watching the grown-ups...       As you guessed, my daughter is     unhappy about giving up her life.     And, in my opinion, cowardly in     avoiding the necessary confrontation.  Then he stops.  As if reading Julianne's eyes.       Mike has a world of ability.     I'd do anything to have him in     my company.  One more puff.       Except ask him.  Julianne is a little stunned.  Kimmy looks helpless.       He'd resent it.  And me.  And,     most important, Kim.  No smile on his lips.  Straight talk.       He's a great kid, but he's still     a kid.  Instead of recognizing     that his resistance comes from     insecurity, he'd turn it to anger.     To protect himself...  Spreads his hands...       ... from realizing that he's     ignoring my daughter's needs,     despite how very much he loves her.  He looks to his daughter now.       They both have some growing up     to do.  But they're good people,     they're starting with love.     They've got time.       And that interests me.  How     someone who knows him so well     could be so wrong.  A formidable guy.  She meets his gaze.       I hope so.  This is all too     mysterious to waste on just me.  She reaches into her big bag.  Pulls out a single folded sheet of paper.       Julianne, reading my son-in-law's     mail, is not something...       Matter of fact, that's how I got     married.  The look holds.  She thrusts the paper out.  He still doesn't take it.        I know Ben.  She opens the paper.       It doesn't say th...       And you think he's kept this to     himself.       This fax could mean... any number     of things...  She nods.  She knows that.        Maybe.  I should call Ben.        Mike.  I hate this downsizing...  He reads.  Reads.  Reads.  All the air comes out of him.        And Kimmy doesn't know.  She shakes her head.  Nope.  No way.        I'll tell her I've reconsidered.  She nods, gravely.  Right.  He looks in her eyes.       You're a smart girl, Jules.  She forces up a fleeting smile of gratitude.  But Walter isn't smiling at all.       Wish my daughter.  Bad your     guts.       I thought Michael was picking     me up.       Kim said, when he turned down     the job, there was no friction.  Julianne thinks back.       I haven't caused... a problem,     have I?       Well, you're a little early...    Julianne enters the spacious corner office, high above the city. Closes the door, quietly, behind her.  So anxious, she is practically hyperventilating.  She goes, slowly to the vacant cherrywood desk.  Its computer and monitor standing silent.  She is stalking it, like a deadly animal.  And then.  She is there.  Talking to herself, her own desperate support network...        Off to rehearsal.  Send out this,     and this, not this, this, and...     that's it.  Slips on his coat.  Oh... and by the way...       I'm holding four or five E-mails     I wrote over lunch...  On his way through the door...       Send 'em out.        Left foot.  REVERSE ANGLE... Kim's POV, the chapel, every pew packed, every neck craning this way, the white satin carpet down the endless aisle to where...  Michael waits.  Also in a zone of pseudo-consciousness.  From which he attempts a smile.  Not comforting.  Kim's POV WHIP PAN the groomsmen, the twins, LOCKING FOCUS on Julianne, standing strong and beautiful, a glow of her own in the daffodil dress.  She sends her little sister a WINK across the trackless miles of aisle.  You can do this, kid.  So...  ... Kimmy does.  On her father's arm, she walks the gauntlet of the world's intrusive admiration.  One step at a time.  The most beautiful she will ever be.  She is dazzling the crowd and managing to not throw up at the same time.  And she's there.  At his side.  She glances back to her maid of honor, just to make sure she's not working without a net.  So Julianne...  ... CROSSES her eyes.  Which lets the kid smile and finally take a breath.  Have a little fun, huh? Kim nods, got it, turns to...  The Minister.  Who stands before them with a calming presence. Thank God someone has done this before.  The crowd has hushed. The Minister's eyes are only for two.  His words are for all...",

        "Isabelle": "I'm Isabelle Wallace, and my     handsome new son scarcely did     you justice, girl.  She takes both of Julianne's hands, and our heroine is sort of magically charmed.  As if touched by Glinda the Good Witch of the North.       Now, my husband says to scoot     you over to the ballpark, so     you can hang with Michael.  But     first, you have to meet a lot of     really old women.  Looking warmly in her eyes...       That is, if you've absorbed     enough profanity.  Flicks a glance at the twins.  Leads Julianne off...       Jules.  We're so glad you     slept in.  Takes her arm graciously.  This woman would make Anne Bancroft look coarse.  As they walk...       Now, you have a choice.  The idea     is bride and groom shouldn't see     each other on the magic day...  Julianne looking all around.  Magic day it seems to be.  Where the bell is a bride or a groom?       So Michael stays put in the garden.     Kimmy stays in here...  Pointing.  THERE she is, obscured by a cluster of the appropriately fawning.  She has the same hunted eyes and false, slightly manic smile Julianne wore yesterday.  This, at least, makes sense.       ... and the guests go back and     forth.  Where will you start?  CLOSE on Julianne.  Watching the brave, frightened bride.        Nerves.  I would never have     guessed.",
        "Julianne": "I'm writing it up as inventive and     confident.  Which it is.  Off the     record, I'll need an extra boat of     the ink.  Or a salt shaker.       If your ass isn't chapped, you     are not a good-writer of note.  She glances at her two remaining waiters, who shamelessly fawn nearby.       Is it sad to be an editor, and bask     only in reflected insincerity?       See the pull of a book like     Twenty Chefs, is not who I     put in.  It's who I leave out.       Plus some guys whose food I don't     like.  Pushes the risotte across to him.  He lifts a fork.       I'll buzz my machine.  Inventive     and confident, yeh?  She dials.  He tastes.       Is Newsday a real interview, or     just some cute guy you're setting     me up w...       Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.       No, no, the opposite.  That's     my best friend, Michael O'Neal.     He sounds desperate to talk.       Sophomore year at Yale we had     this one hot month.  And, you     know me, I got restless...  He knows her.  She got restless.       So I get up the nerve to break     his heart.  I tell him there's     this dreamy exchange student     from Pakistan who wants to,     you know...  He knows.       And he gets this... look.  He     says, \"I knew I couldn't hold     your interest\", which, of course,     makes me feel like the shallow     bitch I've always been...  He nods, yeah.       Then he says, \"But what makes     me want to cry.  Is I'm losing     the best friend I ever had.\"  Hears the feeling.  In her voice.       And when he said it, I knew.     I felt the same.  Silence now.  She covers with a smile.       So I cried.  For maybe the third     time in my life.  And I kissed     him.  And we've been best friends     ever since.  Ever since.  Fingers turning her wine glass...       Nine years, we've seen each other     through everything.  Losing jobs,     losing parents, losing lovers...     travelled all over, we've had the     best times.  The best times of my     life, maybe.  Just drinking and     talking.  Even over a phone.       No, he's nothing like me.  He's     like you.  Only straight.  No offense taken.       He's the salt of the earth.  Kind     and loyal and generous.  The one     constant thing in my life, is he'll     always be there.       Maybe.  But it never gets in     the way.  Something she probably hasn't confessed out loud before.  Digger understands.       Solid and genuine is not boring.     Michael can be completely insane...  A young waiter arrives.  Sets a boat of black squid ink beside her plate.       There was this one night in     Tucson, like six years ago...     we got amazingly drunk, I mean,     Keith Richards time...  The kid tops off her glass of meursault.  Looking at her.       God, I haven't thought of this     in so long...  The waiter hanging now.  Openly listening.       I can even believe we did     this...  Digger sees the guy listening, gestures to her with his eyes.  So she looks up.       Could you give us a minute?  The kid stunned, speechless.  People lose jobs for a lot less.       You won't miss much, I promise     there was no sex.  He reddens and disappears.       He takes a razor from his dinky     little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip,     takes my hand, does the same to me...  She places the tips of her index fingers together.       He says, \"Swear.  When we're both     28, if we've never been married...     we marry each other!\"  And laughs again.  Can you believe that?  But Digger isn't smiling. She wonders why.  Begins to spoon black squid ink onto her risotto.       See, he figured that would be a     sign from God, or someone of     comparable authority, that we'd     misunderstood our destinies.  He still has this real serious look.  She's still spooning ink.       We never talked about it again.  I     don't know what made me think of...       You think...       He's not proposing marriage,     there's no way I'm buying one     word of th...       He can't do that to me!       When I turn him down...  She realizes the full weight of the truth.       We'll never be the same.       I'll have to kill myself before I     call him.  Staring in each other's eyes.    Julianne furiously scrubs her blackened tongue with a toothbrush. Gray foam pours from her mouth, spattering the oversized basketball jersey she wears as a nightshirt.  In the mirror, her troubled eyes dwell on Michael, flick to the cordless phone standing ominously on the closed toilet lid.  She spits, sticks her tongue way out.  Incredibly black.  Great. Depressed, terrified, and disfigured for life.  She snatches up the hated phone, and wanders aimlessly into...  ... her bedroom.  West Village view.  Defiantly jumbled, aggres- sively eclectic.  Traces of wonderful taste mixed with I-like-it- you-got-a-problem-with-that? She stumbles around, rehearsing...       This is awkward timing, Michael,     I just joined this convent, and     they never give your deposit ba...  Stops.  Full-length mirror.  She straightens her hair, to look her best.       Michael, I'm married.  Not enough.       ... and I have two weeks to live.  Changes tone...       Michael, I'm trying to be gay,     don't confuse me.  She turns to continue pacing, and walks straight INTO a dresser. Stuns her, momentarily.  Enough, already! She punches up the number, primping absently in the mirror.  When it connects...       I was calling Michael O'Neal,     but seeing it's so late, I could     just leave a mes...  No such luck.  Cut off.  Waits.  And then...       Good evening, sir.  You've been     enrolled in the Obscene Call Of     The Month Club, and th...       Yeh, well my old machine kept     eating messages.  I tried     constructively ignoring it in     hopes of improvement, but finally...       I just have to tell you this one     thing first, okay? I mean this     will hand you the biggest laugh     of your adult life...  Silence.  Come on girl, suck it up.       I was thinking about you, and I     remembered this unbelievably insane     night we spent together in Tucson,     like a thousand years ago?  More silence.  Really quiet.       I mean, there's no way you could     possibly remember the...       Well, that's great.  You haven't     really had anybody since Dingbat     Jennylee...       Well, somet...       Well, sure.       You've met her parents.       Michael, it's Wednesday night,     you can't possibly be getting     married on Su...       Aren't you... working this weekend?     I mean, is that responsible?        ... Thomas, yeh.  She's staring at herself in the mirror.       Well, maybe we should talk ab...           You have no appropriate sense     of emergency.  My best friend     is ruining his life.       Same difference.  If you love     someone, it's your duty to save     them from themselves.       It's called the Law of Love,     asshole.  She is tight enough to snap.  And at the edge of tears.  Staring out at the skycaps, clinging to her cigarette, as he eases to the curb.       I'm a busy girl.  I've got four     days to break up a wedding, and     steal the bride's fella.  She finally looks at him.  He doesn't say anything.       He's adored me for nine goddamn     years.       She knows him maybe five seconds,     plus she has billions of dollars,     plus she's perfect, so don't go     feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!  He's not.  So her voice softens.  Which shows the hurt.       And don't go feeling sorry for     me, you don't know me that well.     We're only friends.       I'm making a big mistake, huh?       I'm gonna bring him back, man.     Against all odds, y'know.  Cos     if I don't...  She wraps her fingers around his.       ... I gotta live with it forever.  Looks in his eyes.       And at my wedding.  I'll be the     only bride with her own best man.  And she kisses his cheek.  Jumps out of his car.  Before she cries.  Yanks her bags from the back.  Brave smile.  They trade small salutes.  And then she's gone.       Not hardly.  He beams.  Turns.  She follows his gaze, and...  ... there she is.  KIMBERLY WALLACE is 20, small and slender, but it is a body to die for.  The face is striking, not at all perky and vapid, but lovely and interesting.  Worst of all, intelligent.  She walks toward them purposefully, her eyes locked to the woman in her fiancee's arms.  At the last moment, Michael releases Julianne and Kimmy...  ... THROWS her arms around the startled visitor.  HOLDS her tight, with such genuine warmth that Julianne can only, slowly, hug back. As Michael beams.       Well, we're...       You need a few dollars.  Kim glances over.  At eighty miles an hour.  A bittersweet look.       Excuse me?       Can you watch the road?       ... you want a menage on your     wedding night.       Uh.  How about promoting a     bridesmaid?  Someone you know     for at least forty-five minutes.  We CUT OFF a huge SEMI who BLASTS his horn.  Kimmy fearless, oblivious, and analytical...       Which was the disqualifying     factor?       Sounds like a plan.       I thought bridesmaids had to wear     the same dress.       What else did he tell you...       ... not even love.  The look holds.  The seamstress keeps working, as if she's deaf.       That's why Michael and I were     the wrong fit.  Right from the     start.       I need a smoke.  And before anyone can breathe, she steps OFF the platform RIPPING the living shit out of the gown, right down the side.  The seam- stress' eyes FLASH OPEN in abject horror.  Julianne, a deer in headlights, looks quickly around at the evidence of her screw-up in six different mirrors.  Kimberly just steps to her, fingers the tear...       Don't you have to be somewh...       Come in, and shut the...  Stops.  Because it's Michael who has entered.  With the dress.       ... door.  So he does.  She flushes and SNATCHES up her own clothes, which were characteristically tangled in a heap, and tries desperately to untangle them enough to cover herself.  He is amazed and amused by her embarrassment.       Michael, I'm in my underwear!  She's TEARING at her clothes, only making more of a mess.       Things are different now.  He looks in her eyes.  And nods, a little sadly.  Guess they are.       What's the sec...       ... luckiest guy in the Northern     Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...       ... most sentimental schmucks I     pity want a honeymoon after their     wedding.  Just to top it off.  The valet gives Kimmy her ticket.       So your honeymoon is exactly where?  Well...       ... garden sports, all.  Little swing     of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit,     represents a packing challenge, but     there's fine food and cocktails at a     choice of Embassy Suit...  At the elevator.  Kimmy SLAMS the button.       I'm just saying he's lucky.  An empty elevator arrives.  They get in.       Takes one woman in a billion to     put up with his array of shit.     The guy is a one-man festival of     idiosync...  Kimmy SLAMS the penthouse button.  Looks at her calmly.  Go on.       Well.  You've been introduced     to the symphonic range of...       How about...       A trademark move, don't touch     it.       It's been awhile.  I'll take     your word.       Do you get nervous in small     confined spaces?       Let me rephrase that...      Do you get hysterical in small    confined spa...       Oh, yeah?  Kimmy nods.  Confides...       Well, perfection can get wearing     after whi...       No.       I was gonna predict that.       I've missed a step.       Jesus, we're trapped!       No, this happened to me once,     almost, it was excruciating!  Begins BANGING random buttons, out of control.  Kimmy watching this.  Julianne looks WILDLY up...       There's a panel up there, you     could boost me...  RIPPING off her platform shoes.       You know how little air is     in these things? I've seen     statistics! Once you're trapped     between floors...  Kimmy taps her.  Points to the lighted panel.  It says PH, they've reached the Penthouse.       God! Then the door is jammed!  Takes a heavy platform and begins BANGING the metal door with all her strength, sending resounding BOOMS throughout the area, as Kimmy reaches and...  ... presses DOOR OPEN.  The metal doors part, opening directly onto the banquet room, just as a mighty blow comes down, and the platform FLIES from Julianne's hand straight BETWEEN...  ... two identical stunning YOUNG WOMEN, serving as twin hostesses for the shower.  A beat of mutually-stupefied looks, and we hear the shoe CRASH somewhere, to a small spattering of SHRIEKS.        I'm Julianne Potter, and...       ... unless he has a hump.  The girls cast identical blank looks at Kimberly.       Desperate measures! Do you     hear me?  Digger, are you the...  SQUAWK.  Static.  Then...       I don't know, hit men, whoopee     cushions, saltpeter, something!     The girl is impossibly impregnable.     Even I want her to get the guy!!  Listens.       Tell him the what? The truth...??  She shakes her head.  What a guy.       That desperate.  May I never get.       Which of you gents ordered     two beers?  One single tray.  Holding fourteen beers.  Balancing on one hand. Michael JUMPS UP, terrified at the impending mayhem this sight suggests...       Michael.  You'll unwittingly     imply that I'm clumsy.  He stops in his tracks.  The guys whistle.       It's Miss.  And thanks.  That     leaves two for me.  Heads down the row...       I guess getting him whacked would     be politically out of the question.       Nice meeting you, too, Walt.  A nod between equals.  She moves on...       Papa Joe.  They go way back.  He is uncomfortable at this rich man's wedding, even as gracious as everyone has been.  His watering eyes twinkle at her, and the voice has a trace of Boston...       Best everything, Joe.  But I'm     going to dance with you.       Moves.  You've never seen.  BIG reaction from the guys, as she heads toward Michael with the last of the beers, not looking down at the FIELDER'S MITT which lies right in her path, and as his lips part to scream a warning, she skips...  ... neatly AROUND it.  He's in shock.       I just admire your maturity,     that's all.  I mean, there are     people who would find that kind of     perfection boring.  Day after day,     year after year...       Such as.       Hate that.       What's next?  Keep sipping.  Never look at each other.       Endearingly absent-minded.       Quite the little eccentric.       Is there a coup de grace in     here, somewh...       Waiter! Check, please!       Can that kind of defect be     passed on genetically?  She looks over now.  And Michael is looking back.  Smiling the most wonderful smile.  Her reaction shows that she thinks it's for her, until...       Gimme like, eight and nine off     the top ten list...       Looks like, from here.       How'd you find this pl...  Kim shaking her head.  Looks admiringly to Michael...       ... always.  The best dim sum, the     best camping stuff...       ... best valley in New Zealand,     best... women's shoes...       Where was that, Florence, huh?       The Vespa? Me hanging on behind     in the rain all night?       Take her there.  He nods, okay.       I mean, now.  She's perky,     she deserves a honeymoon.  He draws a breath...       I heard.  If San Antone sweeps     Sacramento.  What is this shit?     You gotta get off the road by     September anyway, when does Fall     Quarter start?  And the happy couple look at each other.  They are awkward. Julianne's heart soar like eagle.       Don't architects find a degree,     sort of... an asset?  The couple still staring in each other's eyes.       They're gonna drool anyway!  Kim smiles.  He kisses her, tenderly, through the open window.  She waves past him at Julianne.       Should I whistle down a cab?       Sometimes.  About the dumbest     things.  Share a smile.  As always, it covers a lot of years.       No.  I'm always safe with you.  She means that.  He takes her by the hand.  They begin walking...       Pretty amazing girl, you've got.     Make that kind of sacrifice.       ... all of it.  She's leaving her     family, her friends, everything she     knows.  She's putting her career     on hold, and she seems a pretty     ambitious, driven, kind of pers...       All to follow you in this dumb     job, where you travel 52 weeks     a year to College Station, Texas,     and such.  It's not a job for a     grown man, Michael, Peter Pan     never married.  He's let go of her hand now.  Looking down at the pavement before him, fists in his jacket pockets.       I don't think she's naturally     the... submissive type.  Aren't you     afraid she's gonna choke on this     stand-by-your-man shit after awhi...       I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable     sports... most girls in her spot would     be angling to get Daddy to offer you     some juicy gig right here in t...       I guess you're right.  That would     be deceitful... manipulative...     controlling... emascula...       Still.  All's fair in love and     w...       Forgive me, okay? I was talkin'     crazy.  He slides his arm around her shoulder.  Pals.  They climb out of frame.       It's Albanian, I think.  Or Mongolian.     Or Canadian.  One of those.  I bought     it downstairs...  ... it becomes truly disgusting lumpy green mud.       I figure, what the hell.  Can it     make me look worse?  Follow the hand up as it SLATHERS the shit across her face in great green dripping gobs.  She's juggling the wall phone, trying to keep it mudless, as she assures Digger...       Dig, of course.  Of course, of     course, of course, of course I     have a plan.  Certainment!  More green slime.  The Julianne we know disappears.       How? I ask myself, what would     Lucy Ricardo do in this situa...  Desecrates three hotel towels, wiping her hand.       Well, one worked, once.  THROWS them in the bathtub.  Fastidiousness a short suit.       Ricky wouldn't let her in     the show.  Reaches for her toothbrush, absently.  All her attention is on the conversation and the hideous green face in the mirror.       I recall it differently, but     we digress.  Without looking, picks up a tube of hotel shampoo...       So in the version, you're Ethel,     with better fashion instincts.  Squeezes it all over the toothbrush.       This puts you in charge of Plan B,     the unprincipled and insanely     dangerous back-up plan...  Lifts it toward her mouth, liquid shampoo dripping from the bristles.       In case simple lying doesn't work.  At the last second.  She stops.  We don't know why, because she's still never looked at the brush.       Question.  What happens if you     brush your teeth with shampoo?  Turns on the tap.  Tries to scrub the toothbrush clean, and DROPS the phone into the green swamp, which SPATTERS all over her front. Euucch.  She's stymied, agitated, circling the sink, leaning down to it...        You okay? This is one of those     problem phones.  Lifts the toothbrush and tube of paste from her kit.       Right.  Your role.  You know guys     from Sports Illustrated, yes? I     mean, you can walk right in there...  Squeezes on the paste, lifts the brush to her mouth...       You could get access to letterhead,     for example.  JAMS it in her mouth, brushing as...       ... or even, maybe, their fax.  Stops.  The funniest look on her face.  Down to the toothpaste tube...  Which says BEN GAY.  Oh.       It's an homage thing.  Hmm?       Awkward girls grow up on Audrey     Hepburn movies.  You wouldn't     understand.  Kimmy doesn't.  But wipes a blue glob from Julianne's face.       Oh, that.  I forgot I even said     th...       Probably am.  Forget I brought it     up.  Points to some jade pins.  Kimmy wrinkles her nose.       Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad     flights, bad hotels, real bad food.     Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe     your copy gets into one issue out     of four...  Smiles.       What's not to love?  None of this is lost on Kimmy.  She's wondered the same.       ... whatever is manly and     independent.  Kim nods slowly.  Way ahead of her.       Why would he trade that for     running, say, a big piece of     the PR at a powerful, complex,     challenging conglomerate like     your dad's?  Kim stares back.  A strange look.       I'm not stupid.  Say, how     about this?  Pointing to tiny golden scissors in the novelty case.  Kim so absorbed by the main topic, she has to force herself to focus on...       Gold nose hair clippers.  Points to the tiny hand-lettered sign.  Indeed.  Kimmy shrugs, not quite it.       Hello.  Kim nods, oh.  But can't keep her mind off...       By any yardstick that involves     sanity, it would be the greatest     thing that ever happened to him.     Present company excepted.  Kimmy nodding slowly.  Her yearing achingly apparent.       On the other hand, he's proud.     Last thing a man wants to admit,     is being trapped in a dispiriting     dead-end job that can never     support a family.  A very sweet smile.       Throw a man a life preserver.     He'll say, \"Thanks, anyway,     I'd rather drown.\"  Kim nods again.  Right.  They are so bonded at this moment.       Exactly.       What you said.  Make it appear     that he's doing you the favor.  Kimmy bites her lip.  Her eyes go down.  Self-conscious to admit...       I couldn't really... do that.     After, you know...  Her voice trails off.       ... lying.  All the time.  That brings the gray eyes up.  Julianne bats her dark ones...       Oh, darling, my pitiful desires     and ambitions are dirt beneath     the manly boots of your priorities!  Kimmy has to smile small.  A self-awe gal.       Two hundred seedy motels a year?     Dinners out of vending machines?     Waiting for you in vermin-infested     corridors of dark crotch-rot locker     rooms? This stuff makes me hot!!       We make Dad your co-conspirator.     Michael does a favor for Walter.  Simple.       Walter's reorganizing his public     relations, needs a brilliant guy     who's close to him, who he can     completely trust.  Kimmy nodding.  Hope overriding reason.       So you beg.  Michael, please do     this for Daddy, please, please,     please, blah, blah, blah... it's     only for six months...  it would     mean so much to me to help him out...  Turns up her palms.  Viola!       Only.  If he wants to.  They share a smile.       In six months, he'll be happy,     settled, successful...       Bridesmaid gifts for two, well,     assertive, outspoken, Tennessee     debutantes.       Nothing here seems to quite capture     their distinctive personalities.       Could you do this...  Tossing an object on the counter...       In 24 carat?  It is a MASTERCARD.  A gold one.       Your call.  You can live a lie.     In a fabulous selection of Red     Roof Inns.  Or you can make one     desperate stab at hap...       How mad could he get?       Great.  I've got this girlfriend     at the Justice Department?  With     all this time on her hands?  Her look is every bit as hard as his.  He gestures to the escalator.  She takes Kimmy's hand, and up they go.  We can see Walter in a big leather chair, enjoying a major stogie.  Kimmy licks her lips.  They enter.  Every head turns.  A nice range of reactions, from offended to attracted and points in between.       Piece of cake.  I'll hang, and     think happy thoughts...  Kimmy nods.  Heads over toward her father.  Julianne walks, confidently, even provocatively, to the wall lined with bins of cigars.  Every eye in the place is on her butt.  She runs her fingers over a few contenders.  Plucks one out, examines it, puts it back.  Walks a little farther.  Selects another, big and black.  Rolls it expertly in her fingers.  Sniffs along its length.  A guy comes over.  Could be 40, successful, a broker's pin-stripe. Nearly as attractive as he thinks he is.       Yeah.  Do you?       I like 'em long and hard.  Kind     of... big around.  Runs it under her nose.       Smell is important, I'm a believer     in that.  Takes a match from a cut crystal bowl.       But you never know what you've     got.  Till you run your tongue     over it.  And she does.  Moistening the full length of the cigar.  The boys are laughing openly.  She STRIKES the match.  As she lights up...       Actually, I'm partial to married     gentlemen.  The way she says that.  The guy swallows.  We can see some of the air has been sucked from the room.       It's so much time.  When I phone     the wives.  Explosive LAUGHTER from the peanut gallery.  As she jams the big Clemente Churchill into her mouth, she sees Kimmy waving her over from across the room.  Without even looking at the guy she's just put away...  ... she crosses the room, Walter stands politely, looking very dapper, very powerful, and focusing on her with considerable interest.  He waits until she sits on the edge of a costly leather hassock.        I think you're making a mistake,     sir.  His eyes come back to her.  A little sharply.       See, I love him, too, as much     as anyone here.  And for a     whole lot longer.  From her heart.       I think I know best what would     make him happy.       Okay, okay, okay, okay, I hear     you, all right?  She closes her eyes.       It is stupid, dishonest, desperate     beyond belief, and can't possibly     ever work.  It can only end in     humiliation and disgrace.  Now can     I say two words?  Deep drag on the cigarette.  For strength.       Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!     Do it! Do it!  She's striped her gears.  COUGHS horribly.       All right, twelve words.       Some crazy person.       I never eat when I'm serene.       I switched that around when you     weren't looking.  She swirls a single nacho chip in cheese.  But her heart isn't in it.       Boy, those were the days.  And when she looks over.  His eyes are waiting.       That was nice.  The way you     said that.  So was that.  He's feeling restless, something.  Doesn't know quite what to say.       You need a baby-sitter.  That's     what I'm here for.  He holds her eyes.  Then looks down.  Awkward.  And the way he's doing it begins to excite her.       Say it.  He looks up, neither one of them noticing that as they walk, she is about to...  ... CRASH into a chest-high metal stand that displays animal facts. We have followed him as she is WIPED from frame.  His face from shock... to amusement.       See, I can only do it with     beer.  He takes out his handkerchief.  And with that and his hands, gently scoops the worst of the mess off her.  The fact that he's touching her breasts and her body is something they pretend not to notice. She laughs softly, and a few tears fall, even though she doesn't know why.  Such an odd, raw, confusing moment.  To the world looking on, they are lovers.       Bet you're glad I'm here to     take care of you.  He puts his arm around her.       She doesn't scare me.        Is anybody watching?       I picked up Michael's messages     for him, at our hotel.  I stole     one...  His face darkens.  The easy smile fades.  He holds up his palms...       Sir, this is important! Haven't     you ever in your life cut one     corner, to make something important     turn out right?  His smile returns.  Just a little.       It's a fax from Sports Illustrated     from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.       \"Mike.  We still have no answer to     our E-mail of Wednesday.  Which     option do you select? I don't mean     to rush you, but Personnel needs to     tie up the loose ends.\"  He takes the paper.  We see it now.  Looks authentic.       I think he's been fired.       He's said some things over the     past few weeks.  Look, this is why     I came up with the idea of you     offering him a job.  He looks up.  He's listening.  Closely.       And why I couldn't say anything     before in front of Kim.  She bites her lip.  Seems so earnest.       I just think of how... desperate     he must be feeling.  He's marrying     a rich man's daughter, and he's     about to become destitute.  You     know the kind of job market he'll     be facing?  He does.       He's too proud to beg for help.     And if you wait till this comes out,     your offer will be like charity.     Completely humiliating.  He's staring at her.  But his mind is working behind his eyes.       If you do it now, it's like he's     helping you.  He can accept with     dignity.  He taps the paper with the back of his knuckles.       Then it could all come out, sooner     or later.  Nobody should be in on     this.  Just you and me.  Or, more     correctly, I.  She takes the paper back.       What if, what if I could find     that E-mail?  The long straight look.  Maybe he's hooked.       I never noticed.  Kimmy has your     eyes.       Hello, again.  She's flirting her ass off.       You still haven't straightened     that tie.  And she reaches across the desk with her lovely, slender hands. Does it for him.  Her fingers brush his chest on the way back.  We can assume a woody.       You know, my friend, the one     whose message I picked up...  ?  He does.  His eyes flick toward his stately female SUPERVISOR, helping another guest across the way.       Well, he's still with the wedding     party.  And he asked me to get     something he needs real badly from     his room...  ?  The boy swallows hard.       He's in 1526.  If you could just     let me ha...       You'll lose your job...       Help me!  The maid can only blink.       I locked myself out, 1526, please     hurry!!  And looks frantically up the hall, mortified that any moment a stranger could happen upon her predicament.  Her eyes dart back to the maid.  PLEASE.  The maid just stares.  Stares.       Uno-cinco-does-ses.  Oh.        You wouldn't change your     password, would you?  You     never change anything.  Those words make her bite her lip.  Damn, I'm becoming a senti- mental slob.  TYPES in...        Shoeless... Joe.  Yes!  We're in!  Punching keys.  Letters flying across the screen. Okay, we're ready.  Types...        Mike.  I hate this downsizing     shit as much as you do.  But I     know this can't become as a     complete surprise...       Never can tell.  He holds her chair.  She exchanges an intimate smile with the anxious Kim.       I think you ought to listen to     her, Michael.  This is her life,     too.  Just the thing.  To bring that anger near the surface.  He turns to Kim...       Michael!!        Michael, it sounds like a     wonderful opportun...       Uh, Kimmy...?    Julianne in her nightshirt, her back to us, sobbing into her cellular as she paces the room...       ... see that's what I never     counted on! I never heard of     a brilliant moron before!  We CLOSE as she WHIPS around, startling us with her grotesque day- glo PURPLE face mask.  The green was better.       I mean, the little twerp       Michael and I are the same person!     Self-absorbed and imperfect and     vaguely loveable! We deserve     each other!  Tears are flowing.  Which, over this mask, is not a pretty sight.       I'm out of hope, I'm out of sneaky     ideas, I'm at the end of my     rapidly-fraying hysterical little     rope!  Help m...  She TRIPS over an open suitcase, and DISAPPEARS from frame.  The THUD is slightly alarming.       God, I hate this hotel.  HOLD.  On nothing is particular.       And I hate talking to your machine!    REAR VIEW of Julianne asleep on the floor, sunlight streaming in. A soft knocking on a door, somewhere nearby.  She barely stirs. The knock becomes a strong RAPPING, and she fights for conscious- ness.  Her back still to us, she...  ... rises, STUMBLES to the door, which is now pulsing with an insistent POUNDING, and THROWS it OPEN, as we SNAP to...  REVERSE ANGLE... CLOSE on Julianne's face, still encased in a now- decomposing PURPLE MASK, her eyes SPRINGING wide, she SCREAMS in shock, and we SNAP BACK to...  ORIGINAL ANGLE... Digger, watching impassively at the high-strung SHRIEK.  In the silence that follows...       Oh, shit!  Starts CLAWING at the overripe mask, but he grabs her wrists.       Chill?  Since when do you say     ch...       You flew all the way h...        You're butting in.  He still holds her wrists.  She brings one of his hands to her lips.  Kisses his knuckles.        I really resent this.       What I mean, when I say annoyingly     perfect, is that there is nothing     annoying about her perfection.     It is vulnerable and endearing.     And that is annoying as shit.       If I didn't have to hate her, I'd     adore her.  She looks up at him and WINCES, as the movement makes him scrape her face.  He's sorry.       Last night, she was crying, these     big, real tears, when she thought     she'd lost him.  It was like there     was a knife in her heart...  Looking in his eyes.  Needs him to hear.       ... and I put it there.  I hated     myself, I grieved for her, I     couldn't enjoy one second of it!     And then, when it didn't work...  Can you believe this?       I was devastated.       Because I realized.  When I see     him say \"I do,\" that knife will     be in my heart.  And it will be     there every...  She holds his wrists now.  To stop him.  To plead for understanding.  Forgiveness.       ... every time I think of him,     forever, which could be a lot.  She almost choked on that last part.  So she composes herself.       You watch a guy caress his     girlfriend's butt.  You see an     Old Spice commercial.  Sentimental     moments are everywhere, when     you're in the right frame of mind.  She swallows hard.  Fights for a grip on her determination.       There are 18,250 nights in the     next 50 years...       ... and having \"done the right     thing\" will only really be     comforting, oh, maybe, five,     six times.  She sets her jaw.       This is my whole life's happiness.     I have to be ruthless.         Sure.  His eyes are gentle and merciless at once.  No way she gets off this hook.       He was in love with me every day     for nine years.  I can make him     happier than she can.        I don't know the meaning of the     word guilt!       I am breaking her heart in the short     run, but doing her a gigantic favor!     She would be miserable tagging     along after this insensitive doofus!       Beyond reason.  The feminist     warrior will rise up in this kid,     and she'll be standing over his     sleeping form with a butcher     knife, selecting from a short     list of body parts!       Let's not get carried away.  And the defenses drain from her clay-ravaged features.  The real Julianne is glimpsed.       I'd settle for.  Someday, I'll     forgive myself.  For...?       For doing this terrible thing.  Her eyes tear up.       Which, by the way, I can't     figure out how to do.  As the tears fall, he wipes at them, discovering...        Guess what I brushed my teeth     with last night?  He thinks about this.  Following her eyes to the toiletries kit, he browses for a moment...       I wish.       Try less appropriate.       That was Thursday.  He stops on that note.        I can't even say it.  Now.  He's curious.       A hint.  The first word is     \"Preparation.\" Then comes a     letter of the alphabet,     perilously close to G.  She reaches to test her curling iron, BURNS her finger, SHIT! KNOCKING the appliance into the half-filled sink.  She LUNGES for it, and a terrified Digger GRASPS her arm...       How do you know you can touch     that plug? Are you a licensed     contractor?       Maybe they just seal off this     room.  They have others.  He's staring at her.  Sweet, but intense.       If I hear the words \"tell the     truth,\" or any paraphrase thereof,     I dive into the sink and pull you     with me.  Looking at her.  Looking at her.       It's too late to start over.  PULL BACK to reveal Michael in his wedding tux, submitting to a final fitting from a stylish fitter.       Like I said, dazzling.        They'd say that's my job.  She runs her hands over his jacket, smoothing it everywhere.  With tenderness that approaches transparency.  Glances back at Digger...       I'll take it home from here.  Pinches Michael's ear.  Looks in his eyes.       Major.  Dish.       Bye, handsome.  Digger just stares at her.  Those maddening judgemental eyes.       You're going to say it, aren't     you?       I'm taking my next book to     Viking.       I'm moving this book to Viking.       Needing.       And what will he do?  Digger isn't smiling.  His voice low, beneath the crowd...       You keep saying that.  Up ahead, the Wrigley Building draws closer...       Well, you've got the rest of     your lives.  REVERSE ANGLE... they lean on the rail of a cruise boat, easing down the Chicago River.  Wind-blown.  Close together.       Getting your bed made.  Every     day.  They smile at each other.  Seem so comfortable together.       You miss her, huh?       If you like.  And she LURCHES over the railing, emitting a BARRAGE of incredibly disgusting sounds, her feet FLAILING in mid-air.  He laughs, as he pulls her back down to the deck.  Of course, it was all a joke.  He brushes back her hair.  Sighs.  Stares.        Have you.  He has.       Well.  There's a lot of memories     to choose from...        You've been the man in mine.  Passing under the Michigan Avenue Bridge.  No one knows quite what to say.       Except for the hot affairs we'll     have twice a year.       Me either.  She watches his surprise.       I couldn't have it without you.  He's glad to hear that.  And then...       I wouldn't know.  I never had     that many first thoughts.       I'll check.  I have it on     powerbook, these days.  He holds up his arms.  And she moves into them.  He begins to dance with her, turning so slowly.  And, yes, people are watching.          The night we met.  Right to his eyes...       The night we fell in love.  He doesn't know what to do with that.       We danced to it.  Just like this.  Just like this.  A long beat.  And he has to say...       No.  Because I won't let you.       I told him, get the important     stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect     the inconsequentials.  Meaning, you.  They smile at each other.  Then...       Friction.  No.  He smiles at her line reading.  But his mind is always probing.       Nobody has.  So far.  Her bright grin.  His eyes linger on it.       I need to make some calls.     Could I use... your office?        You can do this.  Sacred, filled with doubt and conflict.  Her hands clutch at each other.  Then, one flicks out.  And the computer goes ON.  The screen GLOWS.  Waits for her.  Her mouth is sand, her stomach water.  She pulls the paper from her pocket...  ... looks at it.  Looks to the monitor.  And begins.  To type...        E-mail address.  To Ben Isaacson,     Senior Editor, Sports Illustrated,     from... Walter Wallace.  And stops.  Her heart is thumping.       See, you can do it.  It's easy.  Doesn't look easy.  Licks her lips.       You do it fast, it's over.  Like     it never happened.  She sits.  And recites as she types...       Ben.  I need a favor.  Here we go.  This is it.  Types...       My daughter's every happiness.     And my wife's.  And, least of     all, my own, are in your hands.  Nods, okay.  Breathing hard.  Types...       Knowing you value our friendship,     and the... cooperative     relationship between our companies...     I am hopeful of your help.  Touch, that.  Thinks.  It has to be.  Types...       I have offered Mike O'Neal, my     new son-in-law, a great opportunity     in my company.  This would also     enable my daughter to settle in     Chicago, near us, and pursue her     dreams and plans.  Almost there.  Almost.  Types...       To his own detriment, as well     as ours, Michael will not accept     our offer.  While he works for you.  She stands up.  Stares at the screen.  Walks away.  Walks back. Still standing, types...       My daughter joins me in this     plea for your cooperation and     discretion.  Is there a SOUND?  Outside the door.  She HOVERS over the ESCAPE key.  Waits.  Waits.  Silence.  Types...       With gratitude.  For your     understanding.  Walter.  She hits a KEY.  The screen goes BLANK.  The computer asks... DO YOU WISH TO SEND?  She tells the computer...       Are you crazy?  Get him fired?  Types NO.  The computer asks HOLD FOR LATER? And she types YES.       Just till tonight when I bring     him back.  To look for...  She glances to her huge bag.  Rummages through, pulling out a manila folder.  Lays it by the blank computer.  Fans out a few pages in a natural, disorderly way.  Takes a step back...  And stares.  Struck to her gut.  But when she has done.       Well.  She smiles.  One that glows a little.       You sang the song.  Least I     could do was wear the outfit.  He nods.       No accents today.        Yes.  She's staring at the ring.        I'm right-handed.  A hugely embarrassing half-second.  Bailed out by...       Well, I'm worried about something.  Something.  Their expressions are deliciously, identically expectant.       Oh.  I left this really important     file in Walter's office.  I have     to send my editor some...  Some...       ... figures.  On territorial sales.     To close my book deal.  Uh-huh...       So Kim gave me the key.  And     Michael's on his way, to drive     me down to Wal...       Well.  See.  That was a...     reflex to see if it would...       Right.  And then it didn't want     to come off.  Exactly.        I saw the show.       I can't believe this!  PULL BACK farther to see Michael still trying keys from a large key ring in the heavy lock.  Sign over the door says WALLACE ENTERPRISES. Traffic hustles by, oblivious to her suffering.         I promised Digger I'd E-mail him     those figures.  From his face, that wasn't it.       They are very important figures.  Apparently.  He's just staring at her.       I'm up against a deadline.       That's my point!!  Now.  He really doesn't get it.       I mean, tomorrow... we'll all be     busy with more important things.     So...  So?       ... tonight's my last chance.  He sighs.       It's just... up there... right in     front of Walter's... y'know, computer.     If memory serves.  Helpless.       We could use... his computer, to...     just E-mail those suckers right ou...        You're right.  Easy come, easy go.  He's really concerned, can't bear to see her so upset.       It means a lot.  He nods.  Okay.        ... maybe it's congratulations.  He follows her in, opening the envelope.  Stops.  Reads.  And his face suddenly... freezes.  To stone.        Michael? What ha...        I received the following E-mail     this afternoon... \"Ben, I need a     favor.  My daughter's every     happiness...  \"  Her eyes BUG OUT of her head.  Holy shit! We can hear him DIALING the phone.  She keeps reading, it's all there.  How did this happen?        \"Mike, the funny thing is, he's     offering you a gig you'd be     stupid to turn down...\"        \"Maybe you should take the job.     And dump the girl.\"  And when she turns...       No, I just stepped out, because...     it's a non-smoking room.  And inhales deeply.  Leans back against the door, to look up at him more comfortably.        Why don't you have me arrested?  That wasn't sarcastic.  He doesn't know what to say.       I mean that.  Arrested, convicted,     put in solitary.  Another puff.       See, I'm a dangerous, criminal     person.  I do bad things to     honest people.  This, see, this     smoking?  Tip of the iceberg.  Waves her hand.       Make a citizen's arrest, I won't     struggle.  It'll be like getting     Al Capone on tax evasion.  Now she seems angry.  But not at him.  Her eyes fill with tears.       Do you smoke, Richard?       ... a non-smoking floor, yeah.     Well, you know what?  And she takes the cigarette from her lips.  Turns it around, holds it out to him.  Go ahead.  He doesn't move.  Please! And so...  ... he reaches down, takes the cigarette from her hand.  Staring in her eyes, he takes a deep drag.  Savors an expert nostril-inhale of his exhaled smoke.  Hands the cigarette back to her...       Thanks, Richard.  If you weren't     on duty, I'd buy you a drink.  He just nods.  She waves.  He waves back, pushes his cart down the hall.  As she watches him go, the door behind her suddenly OPENS, and she...  ... FALLS through it, flat on her back at Michael's feet.  Staring up at him, seeing that he looks as bad as she feels, she takes raw, deep drag.       What happened?       A bad combination.  He tries to smile.  It's really hard.       Michael...       Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...       I tried it on.  But it won't     come off.  He smiles at that.  A sad smile of friendship.  Then takes her finger gently...  ... into his mouth.  It is something like a kiss.  And when he removes her moistened finger...  ... he pulls the ring OFF.  Nothing to it.  She blinks.       It's mental, you know.  He doesn't understand that.       Should we take a walk?  Or     maybe some food sent up, or     something...       If San Antonio sweeps     Sacramento...  They smiles at each other.  For real.       I've never been to Texas.  Imagine that.  The look holds.  Just above a whisper...    Julianne brushing out her hair in the bathroom mirror, eyeing her image with evident dissatisfaction, as she listens to the receiver      Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...  Her eyes find the pack of cigarettes.  Next to her toiletries kit.        I won.  Her fingers touch the pack.  As if an object of significance.  Takes it up.       Amazing, huh?  I didn't do things     quite your way.  But... I got it     down.  Cradling the phone against her shoulder, she carefully tears the top of the pack completely open.       And forty years and nine grand-     children later, when I sit with     Michael on some rustic porch,     slogging through our sweet swamp     of nostalgic memories...  Reaches the pack toward the toilet.       No one is going to sweet the     details...  Turns it upside down, emptying a dozen cigarettes into the john.       Of one weekend in Chicago.  Drops the lid with a CLATTER.  Hits the FLUSH.       Talk about celebration...  She lifts a tube from her toiletries kit.  Stares at it, real close.       I'm gonna brush my teeth with     actual toothpaste.  Turns it over, reads all the writing.  Yep.       I guess I'm too exhausted to     feel the elation I so richly     undeserve...  Squeezes some paste onto her brush.  Carefully.       So I'm gonna hold calls at the     desk... while I get my...  Start brushing.        God, it is toothpaste, they     should sell this stuff     commercially! Anyway, a girl     does need her...  Squints at her image.  Laughs, spewing a little foam.       ... well, we're a bit past     worrying about beauty sleep.     Let's just settle for not     frightening small animals.  She SPITS.  Tells Digger's machine...       Anyway, I couldn't have done     it without you.  Even though I     did, if you follow that.  Wipes her mouth.  Stares off.  The eyes a little dreamy.       Three words:  Happily.  Ever.     Well, you know.        You're going where?       She looks tense.       I had the craziest dream last     night?  Walter and Kimmy had     asked your boss to...       But the Scotch salmon was so     fucking good, you decided to     stay for brunch!       Get married, apparently.  She comes OFF the swing, PUSHES him back two feet.       What the hell are you thinking     of, the goddamn wedding is SIX      And your point?        I'll be right back.       They'll eat it anyway, you ever     been to a walk?  Kimmy's lip trembles.  This is not how she thought of her wedding. The din is so horrific, Kimmy leads them into a walk-in meat locker.  Even here, two BUTCHERS are dressing Eastern-fresh corn- fed carcasses.       You guys want to give us a     minute?  The men blink at each other.       We'd like to be alone with     our pork.  On that basis.  They leave.  Kimmy sits on a stack of packaged frozen fowl parts.  Stares up with big, sweet, wet eyes.       Who?  The jerk who's running     your life?       What with the psychosis and     all, yeah.  Leans in.  Listen...       When are you gonna come clean     with your folks?       If you're waiting for \"Do you     take this man?\", that's     considered poor form.       Yeah, well, lots of couples are     imcompat...       I'll be right back.        She admits it's her fault.  He absorbs that.  And then...       Sure, she does.  She's crazy     about you.  Now tears stand in both their eyes.  The stoners are doing their Alvin and the Chipmuks impersonation festival in the B.G., singing in castrato harmony.  But our two don't notice.       Does that make it right...       I'll be right back.       He said.  Marry me.  Kimmy YELPS in her ecstasy, FLINGING herself against Julianne, and they go DOWN full length across the organ's pedals, BLASTING the room with a MONSTER CHORD of china-rattling volume and horrifying disharmony.  As grown men and women SCREAM in spontaneous terror below, Kimmy begins to...  ... LAUGH.  And KISS and hug her new sister.  And holds her tight.        Oh, yeah.       Well, it happens.  They pass an expanse of lawn which has become the event parking area.  Family vehicles, delivery trucks, service vans.  Everything that couldn't fit on the circular front driveway.       ... your one chance for true     happiness?       You never want to do that, see,     that's always a... costly     turnover.  As they say in the     sport biz.  There's a vague Stepford Wife quality to her voice.  He hears that now, and looks at her.  Maybe he can't tell she's frightened.  But he can tell she's something.       The Big Hurt, huh?       Got a minute?  He nods, you bet.  Worried for her.  What is this? She looks in another direction, and we now see that we have nearly reached...  ... a stage that's been set up for the band.  Chairs, music stands, sound equipment.  A gleaming dance floor, already in place over the lawn.  Next to it, a shimmering white GAZEBO.  Like the centerpiece of a wedding cake.       Why is the dance floor by the     gazebo?  She takes his hand.  They walk toward it.       Shhh.  Up the white steps now.  Together.  The gazebo floor has been covered with hardwood.  The perfect place.  For a wedding dance. And Julianne...  ... turns, suddenly.  He almost runs into her.  She is staring up at him, so strangely, their bodies only inches apart.  He is caught, transfixed by the intensity in her eyes.       I have to say this quick, okay,     or I'll have this massive     coronary and you'll never have     to hear it.  Which you need to.     Does that make any sense at all?  The coronary part does.  We can feel her heart beating from here.       This is the dumbest thing I will     ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that     I can't.  I don't think.  And then, she does.  She puts her hands flat on his chest.  Looks in his eyes.       Michael, I love you.  A heartbeat passes.       I've loved you for nine years,     but I was too arrogant and     scared to realize it.  Now I'm     just scared.  He stares at her, dumbstruck.  She moves even closer.       I know this comes at an     inopportune time, but I have to     ask this one really gigantic     favor, okay?  Holds her breath.  And...       Choose me.  Marry me.  Let me     make you happy.  And in a half beat of excruciating silence...       I know.  It sounds like three     favors.  His eyes are loving.  They care for her.  She swallows, lost in them.       But when you think about it...  Slides her arms around his neck, and raises her mouth...  ... to his.  The most beautiful kiss she will ever offer.  All of her heart is in this, and as his hands touch her body...  ... a SCREAM rips the world to pieces.  They whirl to see...  ... KIMMY, halfway up the path.  Her hands across her mouth, as if to stem the horror that pours forth as she SHRIEKS from her soul, and...  ... runs.  Back Down the path.  Michael BOLTING after her, SHOUTING her name.  A frozen moment, and...  ... Julianne TAKES OFF after him.  All three running, SCREAMING their various emotions at the top of their lungs, as workmen stop to watch from neighboring countries.  Kimmy, staring from halfway there, has an insurmountable lead. LEAPS into her convertible and PEELS OUT, just TEARING up the gravel as she ROCKETS out of sight.  No way to catch her.  Still...  ... Michael is racing for the cars.  Julianne, sprinting her guts out, losing ground with every stride.  Michael JUMPS into a Cherokee...                    Don't speak!  He just blinks at this sweaty, ripped-up, maniacal figure.        I have to make a confession.     Another confession.  Besides     that I love you.  This is even     worse.  This.  He's waiting to hear.       The E-mail?  You thought Walter     sent your boss?  I wrote that.  You.  WHAT?!  Synapse overload.        ... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the     bad guy.       I didn't know it would get     sent.  I just wanted you to...     get mad at Kimmy... and...  And watching.  As this begins to sink in.       I've done nothing but slimy,     underhanded, despicable, not     even terribly imaginative,     things.  Ever since I got     here.  Trying to...  Staring in his eyes.  Eyes she can't read at this point.       ... to win you.  To win you     back.  Tears in her own eyes now.  Big ones.       And I was blinded by love.     Like you said.  Shaking her head...       But that doesn't excuse any     part of it.  I am pond scum.  No...       Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus     that feeds on pond scum.  Lower.     The layer of mucous that cruds up     the fung...        Lower.       Except it makes me fungus.       So you have to marry Kim.     Because she will actually make     you happy.  I, in contrast, am     a shallow, neurotic psychopath,     with relatively little to offer.  Okay?       Kim.  Nod your head.  Do as     you're told.  He nods his head, still smiling.  Her tears are running now.  Maybe she doesn't notice.       Just promise you'll never tell     me who you would have chosen.     If I hadn't confessed.  She chokes back a sob.       Cos if you would have chosen me.     Then I threw away a perfectly     good life.  Just to be a decent     person.  Which is a questionable     trade-off.  Right?  He nods, slowly.  Because he's supposed to.       And if you would have chosen     some 20-year-old punk over me.     I'd have to kill myself.  Ah.  His smile keeps getting smaller.  More loving.  More wonderful.       I'm so glad you didn't jump on     that train, before...       Why would she come here...       It's two weeks.       That is so romantic.  Which makes him reach and touch her hair.        You can't believe you've lost     her!  Sooner or later, you'll     find her, and you'll look in     each other's eyes, and you'll     see all that love...       Course, if it's later rather     than sooner, I'd hate to be you     at six o'clock.      You've got a lot of explaining     to...       That's little egotistical.  He glares at her.       But, undoubtedly accurate.  She claps her hands, galvanized by the emergency.       Okay, we'll split up.  You go     to every romantic place you     guys have, I'll go... someplace     brilliant, and the first one     who...       ... me, yeah.  And she likes     Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.  Looks at her own watch.  Shit!       It's Jules, you guys haven't     had a call from, say, Kimberly,     have you?       Ex-cuse me?       You are so right.  What a     nerve on that guy!  Bring my     dress to church, huh?  Signals the driver, let's GO!       I want to pick up a little     something for the ceremony.       Going to the john, she said?         Let me in, baby, or I'll rip     this damn thing off its non-     code-compliant hinges...       Incoming.  And she crawls UNDER the door, on her belly.  We go WITH her to see...  ... Kim fully dressed, perched on the closed toilet lid, her knees drawn up, her arms around them.       Pitiful.  And pulls herself up to her knees.  Kimmy tries to glare, but it just isn't in her.       In one minute.  You are going     to feel so foolish.       Have you ever heard of.     Irony?  Irony? Kimmy sniffles.       I threw my arms around your     husband.  And kissed him with     all my heart.  Because I was     so happy.  For you.  Nitwit.  And leans close.  As Kimmy flinches.        He's going to take...      The job!  A stunned pole-axed moment.  And Kimmy's eyes SPRING open.  You mean...?        With your dad, yeah.  Can you     guess why?  Bitch?  Everything inside Kimmy BURSTS free in a torrent of tears...       Well, of course, he loves     you.  Kisses the top of Kimmy's head.        Hell, even I love you.  Kimmy holds her tight.  From her heart...       I never want to go through this     again.        We were bonding, we lost track,     we're officially sorry, now     let's put it behind us.  Kim WAVES at her mom by the chapel entrance.  And takes Julianne's hand for support.       Believe me, we got a bride who's     worth waiting for, yes?  Everybody nods.       Out of our way.       Don't worry, sugar.  Don't worry.       When he looks at you, it will     be as if...  The words stronger.  Because there is no smile.       ... he's never seen a woman     before.  PAN DOWN the white until we are...  CLOSE on the bride's perfect slippers.  HOLD.  And...       I'm a writer, too, not as     good as Michael.  But I do     steal from quality.  She raises her glass.  Everyone at the table does the same.       This is to my best friend.  On     the occasion of his wedding.  Shouts of support, a few whistles.  Silence.  She tells Michael...       If I have truly come to know     your bride as my new sister.     This is in her heart...  She has to stop.  Swallows.  Because she will not let herself cry.       \"Understand.  I'll slip quietly     away from the noisy crowd when     I see the pale stars rising,     blooming, over the oaks.\"  Deep breath.  Looks in his eyes.       \"I'll pursue solitary pathways     through the pale twilit meadows,     with only this one dream: You     come too.\"  A hush.  SHARP applause.  From four hundred hands.  But not from his.  He is too moved.  Too understanding of what he has heard.       I don't have a wedding gift.     But this is on loan.  Until     you two find your song...  And with that the band begins.  The opening phrases of a song we have come to know.  Michael seems overwhelmed.  Julianne nods toward the gazebo...  ... Michael takes his bride's hand, leads her up the stairs, into his arms, as the twins step to the microphone, and guests begin to applaud an unscheduled wedding dance...        You're lovely, please don't ever change,        Keep that breathless charm,     Darling, please arrange it, cos I love you...        Just the way you look tonight.  The band keeps playing.  The dance goes on.  Two people lost in each other.  The way it's supposed to be.       You win a few, you lose a few.     Some get rained out.  And to her surprise...       I did what I came to do.       I'll think about it.  I'm okay.       You, too.  And with the last of her strength...       If the sun comes up, I'll see     you tomorrow, huh?  A chuckle.  At the other end.",
