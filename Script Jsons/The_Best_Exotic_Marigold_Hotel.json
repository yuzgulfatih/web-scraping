        "Ghujarapartidar": "You need a new hip, Mrs Donnelly. It's not a difficult operation.  Regardless. You do need a new hip.  Not me personally, no.  I see.  I'm afraid you'll be on a waiting list for at least six months.  There is another way. Our hospital trust is funding a new pilot scheme, that will enable us to out-source you to another hospital, where they can perform the procedure almost immediately, and at a fraction of the cost.  That depends how you define local.",
        "Douglas": "Would it help if I apologized again?  Just as well. I can't afford the green fees.  It's a luxury development, where all the residents are in their golden years.  Yes. But with more elephants. Simon holes out.  I'm sorry?  And this way we see more of the country. Norman is pushing Muriel's wheelchair.  Let's hope so.  It's just a sandwich.  Would you like some of this? I believe it's aloo ka paratha.  Bird in the room! Bird in the room! Jean pushes him aside, goes on in. Several pigeons are flying around in some panic.  Is everything alright?  I'm afraid he's dealing with my wife. Or vice versa.  And the phone in your room doesn't work. May I?  Now, did you try jiggling it a bit?  Did you kind of bang it lightly on the desk a few times?  Hmm. He twists off the mouthpiece of the receiver, lifts the receiver carefully. And blows on it.  I invested our - well, my - retirement money in our daughter's internet company. She assured me that as soon as the start-up actually started up, and the conversion from virtual to actual proved sufficiently viable, then she would be able to pay it all back.  It turns out neither did she. Douglas has put the mouthpiece back on, holds the receiver to his ear.  There you are. Good as new.  No, of course not. I've got no idea what I'm doing. Evelyn bursts out laughing.  Now, would you like me to not fix that chair? Because I can do that too.  Yes please.  He just coughed. I heard him cough!     Graham was talking about this marvellous temple. I thought you might want to come with me.  You'd really rather stay here all day?  When I walk out in the morning, the street kids all smile at me.  One does this trick where he holds his hands out in front of himself, and then swings through his own arms. Got to be worth a rupee or two.         Spectacular. I went to the temple you told me about. A place of meditation and peace, quite stunning.  No elephants, sadly. Still none. I thought I might see you there. Where did you get to instead?  I don't have to have it too, do         But maybe take a clothes peg for your nose.        I checked yesterday. And the day before. As requested. Will you be staying in again?  Because I hope for a different answer. Because I think you'll be hurt if I don't. And because it's not healthy for you to spend all day and every day in the confines of the hotel. He goes back into the bathroom. Jean changes the subject.  I talked to Young Wasim about it.  No idea. It was in Hindi. Douglas comes out of the bathroom, holding the tap.  I thought I might get it fixed myself.  No time like the present. Actually I say that, but I enjoyed yesterday, and I'm optimistic about tomorrow too.  So do I. He goes. Jean sits for a while, looking utterly disconsolate and lost. Then she gets up, goes over to the balcony. Down below she can see Graham leaving.  Morning. Lovely day.  No no, forgive me. That's not how it works.  And to you. Sorry to butt in, but you don't ask him how much he wants, you just tell him how much you'll pay. She'll give you two hundred. Absolutely no more, final offer.  Pity. Now walk away. Walk away.  I know what I'm doing. Evelyn complies, and they turn and walk away.  He'll come after us.  Absolutely. This is how the game is played. Just keep on walking. They push through the crowds.  He's playing it cool, but he'll come. They keep walking.  He's playing it very cool. They keep walking. Then Douglas stops. Evelyn looks at him.  He's not coming.     You see what I think, and of course I'm no expert, is that the valve seat has eroded, so we'll need the washer changed and a new seat re-ground. Douglas glances back at Evelyn. Who betrays not the slightest scepticism. Jamshed studies the tap.  Well of course, it could be that too. Can you fix it?  I was in a tuk-tuk the other day, didn't seem to be taking the usual route back to the hotel. It turned out that the driver had decided to take me to another hotel, that he was sure I would prefer. And of course one wants to believe that he genuinely had my welfare at heart, and that it wasn't run bg his brother-in-law.  One wants to trust, in general, don't you think? But you never really know, do you? Jamshed stops fiddling with the tap. And takes a hammer to it.  How wonderful.     Not yet. Evelyn waits a moment.  One second. Another pause. DOUGLAS  (cont'd) Oh good lord.  Listen. The sound of a flowing tap. DOUGLAS  (cont'd) And now ... The tap stops. DOUGLAS  (cont'd) No drip. He appears in the doorway, triumphant.  No drip! He walks towards her, hand in the air.  Hi-five ! Evelyn just looks at him. She's never hi-fived anyone in her life. After a moment Douglas puts his hand down.  I've never done that before. It just seemed appropriate. Jean has appeared at the other side of the courtyard. Douglas senses her mood, moves towards her.  Darling!  Let me tell you about ours. Your husband of many a year, who has never even known which end of a hammer to use, has actually managed to -  What did you say?  Why ...?  I don't understand     Who's paying for the tickets?  Not us, we can't pay. And I don't see you asking our friends             First time going in to London with my dad, on his commute... He'd always been so extraordinary to me, so unique. But there he was standing on the station platform, utterly indistinguishable from all the other men in suits. And then of course a few years later I was one of them... Hated my job. Hated it. Sorry, talking too much. Blame a good dinner out.  I beg your pardon?  Not me, I'm heading up to the Badi Mahal Palace. Very excited, been reading all about it.  I would, if I could remember a word. Evelyn laughs. Then Douglas suddenly grabs her. And pulls her out of the way of a motor bike, zooming past them. Sunaina hasn't realised she nearly hit them, and powers on towards the Marigold. Douglas and Evelyn stand for a moment, startled, holding each other. Something passes between them that embarrasses them both. Then they part quickly, guiltily. They're outside a small restaurant, and with exquisite timing, a group of musicians start to play a romantic tune.     I wondered where you'd been. Evelyn turns. Douglas is on the stairs above her.  We're all up top, having a drink.    Forgive me. Evelyn goes quickly to her room, leaving him standing there.     She was upset.  I don't see why else you would have embarrassed me. And Evelyn.  God, can you hear yourself? Can you? Do you have any idea what a terrible person you've become? Jean is stunned into silence.  All you give out is this endless negativity, a refusal to see any kind of light and joy even when it's right in your face, and a desperate need to squash any sign of happiness in me or anyone else .. it's a wonder I don't fling myself at the first kind word or gesture that comes my way. But I don't. Out of some dried-out notion of loyalty and respect, neither of which I ever bloody get in return. There's a long silence.  Perhaps you'd like one of us to accompany you.  Was that Sonny?       My wallet, I forgot my wallet. One second. Before Jean has a chance to say anything, he goes back in. She watches him go.  Right. Then perhaps you could tell her I said goodbye. He turns and walks out.   False alarm. Had it the whole time. Let's go.  It's funny. They call it rush hour, but nothing actually moves. It's not that funny. Although I suppose it's all about context, isn't it? I mean -  Yes?  Maybe there is. A rickshaw arrives next to them, swerving through the traffic. It is ridden by IFTI.  We'll get another flight. We can go back to the hotel, and leave in the morning.  Jean, you heard what he said. He can't do it.  Yes, but  Which is what?  This is not the time to talk about this. Let's wait till we  I won't let you.  It is, isn't it?  I missed the plane.  She didn't. Beat.  (putting down his  Um ... She stops, turns.  What time do you finish?  Tea time.  How do you take it?",
        "Ainslie": "",
        "Evelyn": "What?  You can't talk to him, no. He's dead. He died. There's only me.  That's what your father used to say.  When there'd never really been any discussion at all.  Like he did for forty years  And look how that turned out. She turns to Harold  How can any of us know what Hugh would've wanted? And would he have seen fit to tell us anyway? Obviously the flat has to be sold.  And you're very kind. And dear Polly. But no, I won't be coming to live with you.     How far along is the progress bar? The strip at the bottom that tells you -  They should be. The hotel paid for them. I'm sure they'd rather have us there than not. And its fantastically cheap for the first three months.  I'll call. They do have phones there, you know. Or you can just read my blog.  On the interweb. You can log in whenever you like, read my news.  Could you please, before I go, say one thing that is supportive? Because I've never done anything like this before.  Well. I suppose we'll find out, won't we? They head into the building.  I'm not. Although one has read one's guidebooks. Jean blinks. Evelyn and Graham share a smile. Douglas hides his. And Madge sees it all. As they head towards the baggage carousel, they're met by Muriel and Norman, emerging from the elevator. Norman is pushing Muriel's wheelchair.  What larks, Pip. Douglas is just ahead of her. He turns, smiles.  A few months ago I was organising the church flowers.  A little.  No.  How long since you were here?  As long as I was married. He died recently. My husband.  D'you think we're going to be alright?  What exactly is a tuk-tuk?  Oh, hello.  I was just going to find the manager.  I promised I'd call my son, to tell him I'd arrived, and -     Yes, did that.  That too.  How did you come to be here? In India.  I'm not sure I understand what most of those words mean.  Really?  He moved! He's alive!  Day Nine. Old habits die easier than we think, and new ones form.     No longer do I reach out in the morning for Radio 4. My news comes instead from the Jaipur  . Soon I might even grow accustomed to the storm of car horns and vendors.  Can there be anywhere else in the world that is such an assault on the senses?  Those who know the country of old just go about their business. But nothing can prepare the uninitiated for this riot of noise and colour ...  ... for the heat, the motion, the perpetual teeming crowds. Sonny is conducting his own personal assault on our senses  with the flow of exotic dishes he demands daily from the kitchen. Mooli Moong Dal. Baghara Baingan. Banjari Gosht. Paneer Methi Chaman ... As the list unfolds, the guests, one by one, enter their bathrooms; a litany of doors closing Until Norman. EVELYN  (cont'd) Mutton Vindaloo ... Norman lies on his bed, reading the Kama Sutra. He spins the book round, in order to study an illustration more intently.  Initially you're overwhelmed. But gradually you realise: it's like a wave. Resist, and you'll be knocked over ... Sonny is in discussion with some doctors. Then he turns to see that Muriel has vanished. Through the window Muriel can be seen frantically wheeling herself away down the path... EVELYN  (cont'd) Dive into it, and you'll swim out the other side.  This is a new and different world.     The challenge is to cope with it.  And not just cope ... but thrive.  Please, can anyone direct me to this address? Evelyn's piece of paper gets passed around: none of the kids can read. An older boy finally points. Suddenly there's lots of pointing.  Thank you. She goes to move, but the kids are still all around her.  I'm sorry, I don't . I don't really have much ... She gives them the contents of her pockets.  Alright? Alright now? Goodbye. She starts to walk, is surprised that the entire posse of kids walks with her. In fact, the group seems to be growing exponentially. She looks like the Pied Piper.  I'm so sorry. I didn't realise - She backs into a kind of flatbed trolley, piled high with cooking utensils, which clatter noisily to the ground. She goes to pick them up.  Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry... A man is staring at her: SURESH.  I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get to this address.  Do you understand me? Can you help me find this place?  Is that yes you understand, or yes you can help me?  Let's go with both, shall we?  Thank you.  This is it?  Then thank you. You're very kind.  Builder's tea. It's called builder's tea. And no, I'm fine. Thank you.  I don't think you can. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come. She stands.  I saw your advertisement in the local paper, and it specifically mentioned the ability to talk to older people. But this is not what I imagined ...  I've wasted your time.  I see that. Good day.  Yes. We dunk biscuits into it.  It means lowering a biscuit into your tea, letting it soak in there, then trying to calculate the exact moment just before it dissolves to whip it up to the mouth, and enjoy the blissful union of biscuit and tea combined. It's more relaxing than it sounds.  Good evening. Evelyn sits at her table.  I trust you had a good day?  I got a job. My first. Ever. I'm going to be a sort of cultural advisor.  Perhaps if you wouldn't mind keeping that news to yourself.  Have you had a good day?  I'd like that very much.  Goodnight.  Evelyn.  Until now.  Do you want to see him again?  Then you must.  .You ring in the morning. Let's assume the person answering will be a woman. She will have had her breakfast. Tea or coffee. Semi-skimmed milk, always. If she's under 50 she'll be contemplating yet another diet, over 50 she'll have more or less given up, and be eating toast. The radio may be playing, or more likely daytime TV. A chat show, or a programme with a moderator speaking to a panel of young women whose boyfriends have all slept with their mothers. The girlfriends' mothers, I mean, not their own. Although Anyway, then the boyfriends usually come out, and everybody fights. Sunaina is in the audience. She calls out.  That's the point. When the phone rings and it's this robot nobody wants a machine, but it's almost worse when it's a person behaving like one. All these sales cliches just strung together. 'Your call is important to us'. Is it? Well then sound like it.  Right. That one. Don't ever say that.  Yes, when your middle name is  Which is beautiful. You people are young, vibrant, real. I'm sure the typical housewife would enjoy talking to each and every one of you.  I suppose I'm not typical anymore. Is that the sort of thing?  Day 22. Like Darwin's finches, we are slowly adapting to our environment. And when one does adapt, my god, the riches that are available. Madge looks across the bar. And is startled to see Norman and Carol chatting up a storm, laughing together. As she watches, Norman orders more drinks, then turns smiling back to his new friend. Madge walks slowly out of the bar, and into the night.     There is no past that we can bring back by longing for it  . only a present that builds and creates itself as the past withdraws ...  And India, like so many things in life, like life itself I suppose, is about what you bring to it.   Bow much for this, please Kitna  Thank you. She reaches for her wallet. Then Douglas speaks from behind her.  Good morning.    Yes. The thing is, you see, I did actually want to buy that. To brighten up my room.  Do you think so?  Eight hundred and fifty, nine hundred, nine hundred and fifty, one thousand. She turns to Douglas, smiles.  You'll get him next time. Then she notices something.  Why are you carrying a tap?  The day I met my husband was the day the fair came to town. My girlfriend and I went on the carousel. Her horse was fine. But when the ride began I felt mine give a little, like it might collapse. Then these strong arms were around me, holding the horse together. And a voice in my ear said \"Just trust me\". And I did. Without question. Until the day he died.  The sale of our flat went through last week. I had to sell it to pay off Hugh's debts. I've been forced to get a job out here. Which, in fact, I love. But even at Sonny's rates, I still couldn't make ends meet. After what my own husband did to our life savings. So no. You're right. You never know. Jamshed holds up the tap. Which is now in several parts.  Anything?  How about now?  What?  Mrs Ainslie, how are you? Did you have a good day? Jean doesn't answer. She's staring at Douglas. Who looks so happy.  Do excuse me. She makes a tactful exit. Jean is going past Douglas into their room.  I've been getting out and about as much as I can, but I feel I've hardly scratched the surface. And of course I'd love to see Udaipur. The lake you talked about.        I think you should knock on the door and see.  What was she thinking?  His wife. Manoj's wife. She knew who Graham was. Had he told her? D'you think we'll find out tomorrow?  Tell me.  Sunaina? And now Sunaina is even more humiliated.  You're back. He doesn't turn round. Evelyn has come out to the garden. She goes over to him.  It's been rather an extraordinary night all round. First tell me your news, and then - She breaks off. Graham is dead.  Day 45. Of course it was inevitable. Put enough old people in the same place, it won't be too long before one of them goes... Jean, Douglas, Madge, Norman and Muriel shocked and sobered  We all know it'll happen, but few of us know when. Graham died of a heart attack, evidently not his first. So he had a better idea than most what was coming, he just neglected to tell us. His prerogative.  There was talk of sending the body home, but Manoj felt he should have a Hindu burial. At the place they had visited together. Not a holy place. Although for them perhaps it was.  A body takes a long time to be consumed. Many hours for the mourners to remember their dead. The fire must be lit at dawn, and by sunset, there must be nothing left but ash.  Where do our souls go? is that all of us that is left behind? Perhaps the most we can ask is that when we do shuffle off, we do so knowing that we were loved Manoj pours Graham onto the water. The ashes shim r and dance, caught in the gentle currents.  I went to see Gaurika. Manoj's wife. I wanted to ask her what she knew. And the answer was that she knew everything, that he'd loved another man, and always would. He told her when the marriage was arranged. They had no secrets from each other, none. Suddenly she's crying. Unable to stop. Douglas puts his arms around her, and holds her to him.  And that's right, don't you see? That must be right. Because what is the point of a marriage in which nothing is shared? Her words hang in the air. They stand there for a moment. Jean has come out of her room, and stands there, watching them.  Yes, of course.  I just need some water. She drains the glass.  Yes. I know that now.         I'm actually going to walk. Apparently they're getting ready for a festival.  I'll be fine. Evelyn speaks to both Douglas and Jean.  I'm delighted for your daughter's success. I wish you all every happiness.  I just wanted to hear your voice. No, I'm sorry, I didn't think about the time . How are you? And Polly? The boys . how are the boys? She listens to him. She's holding back tears.  Oh good, I'm glad you've been reading it. Yes. Yes, I've made some very good friends. No, I'm fine, of course I am. As much as she had wanted to speak to him, she now wants the conversation to be over.  I think my money is running out, I'd better go. Goodbye for now, darling. I'll call again later. She hangs up. And stays there with her hand on the phone. Out on the street, Sonny is pulling up. She looks over to him.  They're on their way to the hotel. Sonny looks around, at a loss.  What's the matter?  What are you talking about?  What?  But what about your girlfriend?  This is a disaster.  Sonny, do you love her? Sunaina?  Have you told her you love her?  And you have told her that?  Good. Women love it when you say that kind of thing. It's a powerful aphrodisiac.  No, of course not. Go and find her right now, before you lose her forever. Her future is hers to choose, and so is yours. You can have anything you want, Sonny. You just need to stop waiting for someone to tell you you deserve it. Or you can just keep failing yourself, and hurting the ones you love -     What about me, Mrs Donnelly?  My loss, evidently. I'm not sure what I should do. Nothing here has quite worked out as I hoped.  You don't know him. He's the most loyal man I've ever met.  Day 51. The only real failure is the failure to try.         And the measure of success is how we cope with disappointment. As we always must.  We came here, and we tried. All of us, in our different ways.        Some achieved more than others. but we did our best. Nothing else matters. Evelyn walks through the courtyard, and on out of the hotel.  Good morning.  You're still here.  What about Jean?  I'm late for work. She goes past him.  I get back about 5.  Yes.  With a little milk. She turns and walks away. She's smiling.  Perhaps it's true: we don't stop playing because we grow old, we grow old because we stop playing. Douglas is haggling with a motorbike mechanic. He seems to be having more success with the price than in earlier days.  All we really know about the future is that it will be different.  So we must celebrate the changes.  Let them come. Bring them on. Because as someone once said, everything will be alright in the end ... Coming from the other direction, another motorbike, Douglas at the handlebars, returning Sonny's greeting. And on the pillion seat, riding side-saddle, her scarf flying in the breeze, is Evelyn, on her way home from work. EVELYN  (cont'd) So if it's really not alright, then trust me: it's not yet the end.",
        "Greenslade": "",
        "Judith": "And then after that I worked as a systems analyst for a few years but I just found it so dull, what I really wanted was to do something that was more creative, that matched my ... I'm sorry. On the form they asked for our age bracket, and the age we wanted to meet . and in both cases I ticked 35-45. Now we see the man she's talking to. It's NORMAN. He's dapper, nice looking. And at least 70.  How old are you?  D'you mean you were born in the early 40's?  It's Judith.",
        "Judge": "An occasion such as this leads one to cast ones mind back to the days when I first entered my pupillage. I had the very good fortune of serving as a junior to Mr Justice Stancombe Graham's not listening any more. He's looking around the room. At the old, tired faces.  . the unwelcome news that I would transfer Chambers, bringing to mind the old adage a fronte praecipitium, a tergo 1upi Everything seems to slow down, the judge's mouth moving more and more sluggishly, though his voice remains the same. The effect is strange .. then the sound of laughter.",
        "Madge": "And yet if you watch me, that's exactly what you'll see happen. She picks up her suitcases, heads out of the room. Madge's daughter JESSICA is on the landing.  Nobody listens to you. She heads down the stairs. Craig and Jessica follow.     I loved it last night.  And the night before.  It's tempting, my darlings, but you know why I must leave.  Don't let the buggers get you down. Madge turns to go.  Including my own? Then she's out of the front door, and heading for the taxi.  I have absolutely no idea.  And the connecting flight to Jaipur is first class too? The check-in girl nods, hands Madge back her passport.  I tell you, it's tough to get upgraded nowadays. I had to flirt so hard with the travel agent, it was practically phone sex.  Madge Hardcastle. A pleasure.  There's not enough room.  Are you struggling with the feeling you're not in control of your circumstances?  You know what the shortest prayer in the world is?  Fuck it. Evelyn laughs.  You're not doing the church flowers any more. May as well enjoy the ride. Douglas is watching a nice Indian family. They're having a picnic. The father notices Douglas looking, offers him some food. Douglas makes the namaste gesture, takes some happily.  Where?  My dear man. Rooms have doors. What you're showing me here is an alcove.  How soon?  Does your room have a door?  Then that's where I'll be staying.  Roast what?  Roast what?  He's fainted, that's all. Sonny shakes his watch next to his ear. It's stopped. Norman sits up.  Yes, I see that. Perhaps you could tell me a little about the clientele? Any maharajahs? Wealthy widowed land-owners?  Where do I sign up?  I wonder if I might get a little discount. Owing to my status.  Yes. One was rather hoping to fly under the radar, but one is a member of the Royal Family.  I'm Princess Margaret.     Excuse me. Would there be any wealthy single men in tonight?  Perhaps you could seat me next to him?  I'll have that back, thank you very much.  Please. You have no style to cramp.  As one would something in a museum.  Give me a minute. Then join us. She gets up, heads towards the bar. Where she sits a couple of seats away from the woman. Who is called CAROL. She sits there a moment, then sighs, and starts to talk to the barman.  Rejected again. Many years ago, that man over there gave me the most extraordinary night of my life. He may seem coarse and uncouth, but that only disguises a tenderness and an exquisite sensitivity to a woman's needs Norman arrives at the bar.  They say patience is passion tamed. Carol smiles.  I'm Madge.  And this . is Norman.  So what brings you to Jaipur, Carol?  Oh god.  Norman's in business.  Import-Export.  I have to splash some water on my face. Please God I drown in it. She heads for the bathroom. Norman and Carol share another silence.  I gather the night went well.  Not in the least.  Good morning. They watch him leave.  And?  Is that all? You didn't seal the deal?  What is wrong with you?  Is this it?  You're not worried about the danger of having sex at your age? Norman shrugs.  A midnight booty call. How utterly marvellous.  Don't be. Most action I've had in weeks.  This is getting interesting.  How was the night?  When someone dies, you think about your own life. And in my case, there is less of it in front of me than behind. And I don't want to grow older. I don't want to be condescended to, ignored and marginalised by society. To become peripheral to the action.  I don't want to be the first person let off the plane in a hostage crisis. They laugh together. And don't even see Douglas go.  Are you alright?  That was a gin and tonic.  What's happened?  How are you both?  Perhaps a minute's silence?  I'm happy to walk with you.  Our journey here was arranged and paid for by the hotel, and look how that went. I'd rather walk back to England.  Where's Norman?  But we don't have to leave yet.  Is that wise? I'm not sure he's trained.  It doesn't matter what I think.  I wish you both the very best.  Single by choice. Just not my choice. I actually think it might be over. For me. With men. And if that's gone, I'm not quite sure what's left.  They obviously did the trick.  You may well ask. Madge is sitting under the shade of a tree..  What is he saying?  On my own?",

And trust me, I've still got it. The bell goes; the signal for the women to get up and move along to the next table. Judith leaves without looking back.  I just can't find anyone that wants it. Another hopeful candidate arrives opposite Norman. And looks crestfallen at what's on offer.  I have to go. I do. And I could say I wish you'd come, but I've never lied to you. We both know I need more than you can offer. We know that. Don't we? We see who's sitting in front of him. An ancient dachshund.   Don't make that face at me. Norman's Polish landlady, MRS JELLINEK, is at the door.  I'll miss you too.  Come on. Thorough as you like Muriel is waiting to collect her bag from the belt.  Norman Cousins.  Play your cards right, it could be. Madge stares at him. A voice comes over the tannoy.  (leaning down, to    I'm loving this! Evelyn is sitting next to Madge.  This'll do.  What's going on? Did I nod off? Everyone crowds round Norman, helps lift him back up. Except Muriel. She just stares at them all.  I still think you're cramping my style.  That lady at the bar keeps looking at me.  Why must you mock? I just want to feel young again, to be needed as much as I need, if only for one night, one wonderful night. Tell me you don't know how that feels. Silence for a bit.  Those drinks not ready yet? Madge turns to Carol.  Carol? As in Christmas? Madge winces.  Great. Silence.  Yes, Carol. What brings you to Jaipur?  You're very fit.  I mean you look like you keep yourself in shape. Physically.  Me?  Oh. I'm  Yes.     Although these days there's rather more Ex- than Im-, if you see what I mean.  No it hasn't.  Carol? She was about to go, stops.  Can we drop all this pretence? And start again? I'm not charming. I'm not good at repartee. And I'm not a plutocrat with the sexual capacity of a rutting rhino. My name is Norman. And I'm lonely.  Your Madgesty.  Would you like to hear about it?  Good. Because you're going to. Two drinks, some sexually charged  Two drinks, some sexually charged banter, and we were heading back to her place. Bidding the rickshaw farewell, I walked her to the door.  And there, my young friend, I leaned forward, and I kissed her. Beat.  And what?  We have a date next week.  I wanted to prolong the anticipation. To spend some time with the knowledge that soon I'm going to eat, drink, and laugh with someone, hold her to me, kiss her softly. Then go back to her place and get my end away.  That's right! Me!  I'm worried there's no lead in my pencil.  No snap in my celery.  I plan to party hearty tonight, but I can't guarantee that my love gun will fire.  Will the lance dance, and the trouser lion roar?  I don't know if I can still have sex.  I'm not a young man anymore, doctor. And I'm a little bit scared. Truth be told, I'm a lot scared.  What's today?  Six years.  Aaaaaah, freak out! Le freak, c'est chic .. Aaaah, freak out! Feet slapping in the soapy water, he performs a nifty disco move.  This is it.  If she dies, she dies. He leaves. Sonny sprints into the courtyard.  I have seen the top of the mountain. And it is good. Graham nods, sits down next to him. They gaze out at the waking city.  A man... .?  Carry on.  Top of the mountain.  Rather special. He leaves. Madge just stares after him.  Good evening, the Ainslies. Douglas and Jean are approaching them.  Turning left?   Two should fit us all, I think.  I'd rather not go back at all. A voice comes behind them. Carol has come out of the courtyard.  Ready?  We're moving in together.  So I'm not clear now. Am I staying or going?  I'd like to.  I sleep in the trees.",

        "Graham": "Bloody retirement parties. Hard cheese, soft wine, and endless speeches. Why do people do that? No one ever said about any kind of party: it was a wonderful occasion, just a shame that the speeches were so short.  One day very soon.  This is the day. Everyone looks round at him. He's almost as surprised as they are that he's spoken out loud.  This is the day. He turns and walks out.  D'you want these books?  Mrs Megson! His cleaner, MRS MEGSON, comes in.  I want you to have this.  Absolutely. There's a slight crack on the bottom. But I think you might know something about that already. Mrs Megson goes.  I used to live there. A long time ago.     Alright. Plan B.   The bus will drop us in the centre of town. We can take tuk- tuks the rest of the way! They follow him through the hordes. And see their bus. It's absolutely rammed. People are practically hanging out of the windows.  It's time to prove the first and only rule of India: there's always room. He starts to fight his way to the door. Evelyn's at the back. She stops, for a moment, looks around her.  Forty years.  I'm sorry.  God, don't ask me. I'm more scared than you are. They both smile, sit in silence for a bit.  Yes. I think it's going to be extraordinary.     This can't be right, surely?  But there were houses all along here . these were homes.  No. That'll do for now. Thank you. He hands over some money, and Pravesh pedals away. Graham turns to look at the boys playing cricket. One of them, SANJAY, is batting.  Excuse me. There used to be  And the people? The families?  Don't grip so tightly with your right hand. Sanjay looks puzzled.  On the bat. The right is just a guide. Keep your left elbow high, play down the line of your arm, and then you'll hit through     Come on. Do your worst. They're both enjoying the banter, as Sanjay heads back to the beginning of his run-up, then turns and sprints in to bowl. As Graham watches Sanjay running towards him, Sanjay seems to slow, his movements becoming sluggish, never seeming to reach the crease. He looks at the faces of the other boys, frozen, waiting. The ball seems to take forever to leave Sanjay's hand. Graham steps back, completely fails to play a stroke, and is bowled.  Yes. Yes, I'm fine.  Mrs Ainslie. I hope you had a good day. What did you get up to?  Why would you not go out? There's so much to see. Jean had hoped for some appreciation of her wit, and is floored by his question. She can hardly understand, let alone tell him, the depths of her discomfort.  Open your eyes, Mrs Ainslie. All life is here, I tell you. Jean stares at him. He goes on through the archway into the hotel. Then stops.  I could talk to the chef, if you like. Perhaps get you some grilled chicken, plain rice.  Good evening.  I'd rather hear about yours.  A role I'm sure you'll perform with great distinction. He's about to inquire further, when Evelyn sees Douglas and Jean emerge from their room.  I'm flattered you shared it with me. He turns to greet the new arrivals.  Good evening, the Ainslies.  Well, I've just finished telling Mrs Greenslade all about it. Evelyn registers the lie, but says nothing.  I talked to the chef for you. He said it will be no problem.  Goodnight to you. He seems about to say something else. She waits for a moment, then walks on.  Mrs Greenslade?  Can I show you something?     I grew up here. Just a short drive away. It was a big house, and we had servants, everyone did. We knew their wives, their children. One boy, Manoj, became my friend. We played a lot of cricket together, played anything we could. And that's how it stayed for years. Until one night, he became something more. We had a few months, we had that. There was a weekend in Udaipur, we sat by a lake and watched the sun go down, and I remember thinking . I will never be this happy again. And I was right. Because quite suddenly it was over. We'd fallen asleep, and they found us.      And now I think .. what if I am the last person on earth he wants to see? Evelyn says nothing.  I don't think I can go through with it.  Yes. Yes. Oh yes.  She won't speak English. She's what used to be called an Untouchable. An outcast, born below society. To a good Hindu, even her shadow is polluted. He greets Anokhi in Hindi, and heads for the door.  I don't think so. I'm gay. Although nowadays more in theory than practice. Good day. He leaves. A moment later, Jean comes rushing out. Immediately she realises two things; first, that Graham has already gone. And second, that Muriel is watching her.  Good morning.  Yes, you did say that. You did.  I'll try not to come in tomorrow.  Good evening. Muriel nods at him, and he goes on into his room. A moment later, Jean sits down next to Muriel.  But I've filled out that form. I've given it to you. Many times.  But it's the same enquiry I make every day.  Mrs Ainslie... .?  Unutterable beauty. Everywhere. In the light, the colours, the smiles, the people who see life as a privilege not a right, and so teach me something every day. The waiter brings their tea.  It'll be fine. The waiter goes.  It's a pleasant surprise to see you out and about.  Yes. That's progress. Where were you going?    I'm gay. She stares at him. Beat.  I'm not embarrassed. Jean smiles wanly, grateful for his lie.  I'd love to take you. Perhaps - He breaks off. Douglas and Jean have come in. Jean looks rather desperate.  Good evening, Mrs Ainslie. Please allow me. He pulls a chair out for her. She shoots him a look of passionate gratitude for his exquisite sensitivity.  What is it, Sonny?  That is great news. What are working?  Well, congratulations.  It's a false alarm. There's no way they could find anything in that office. They probably just picked an address at random, just to keep me off their backs. I'm sure that's what happened. It's going to be nothing. Don't you think it's going to be nothing?  Yes. Yes I should. Yes.  I'm sorry to disturb you so late. My name is Graham Dashwood. A long time ago I -  I am afraid I don't know you.  (after a fraction of a  How did it go? Norman turns, to see Graham standing above him.  I saw someone yesterday, a man I hadn't seen for many years. A man I've loved all my life. Norman is a bit startled by this.  Yes.   I didn't know how he'd been in the meantime, didn't want to guess. I brought disgrace upon him and his family, and imagined he might hate me for it. But we talked all night. He's been happy. He's led a peaceful life, married to a woman who understood him and loved him nonetheless. But he's never forgotten me. That's what he said. I asked his forgiveness anyway. He said he had nothing to forgive me for. That instead I should forgive myself. All that time. All that time I believed I'd sentenced him to a life of shame. When I was the one in prison. But not any more. Silence for a while.  Yes. Norman smiles, then stands and goes on inside. Graham settles back into his chair, looks out at the world.  Not any more.",

        "Jean": "What if we fell somewhere else?  It's just that we might not manage to plan our sudden fall in the exact corner where the button is.  And would it be possible to get the rail to go through the middle of the room as well?  To help us get across, not just around?  Thirty years in the Civil Service and this is all we can afford?  No. But try it anyway.     Obviously one's read one's Kipling, but we view this as an opportunity to explore another culture, as well as making new friends. And a retired judge is just the class of guest one was hoping for, isn't it Douglas?  You don't seem like an experienced traveller.  Of course it's a good idea. Who can you trust if not a High Court Judge?  Douglas, these are not words that often pass my lips, but you may actually be right. The country seems to be rather more civilised than one originally thought.  Are you insane? \"Avoid all food not from a reputable vendor, it will have been washed with impure water.\" Douglas keeps eating, with great enjoyment.  Marvellous. Then I'll have the ham, cheese, and streptococcus, please. Or perhaps the bacteria, lettuce and tomato. Douglas turns to Muriel.  I want to stay at the other hotel, the one in the brochure.  You've Photoshopped it!  What will start to make this alright is for you to give us a refund.  You will? Straight away?  So the upshot is that he's spent all our money getting us here, and we can't leave till he's made some more. Muriel has arrived at her table.     I'm your wife. Have we met?  Given the alternative, yes.  Because you give them money.  Good evening, Your Honour.  Well, I started in my bedroom, where I had a lovely couple of hours giving all the cockroaches names. Then after a lunch that will long have a place in my heartburn, I came out here and stared blindly at a book waiting for someone - anyone to rescue me. And how glad I am it was you.  I would appreciate that very much. Graham goes on in. Jean just sits there. Wishing he'd come back out again.  So spiritual, I bet you hardly noticed the smell of elephant dung.  Yes, where do you get to every day?  I'm sure she wouldn't mind hearing it again. She waits. But Graham is as elusive as he is tactful.  Did you hear that, Douglas? Plain grilled food; manna from heaven.        Good morning. Muriel says nothing.  Lovely day. Still nothing from Muriel.  Lovely. Lovely. She turns and goes back in. Muriel thinks for a while, then turns to Anokhi.  You know where he goes. I know you know. But you won't tell me. Muriel says nothing.  I can get Hobnobs out here, you know. I know a way. As many as you want. Milk or plain. Long pause.  Thank you.     Will you check in at the bank? Douglas emerges from the bathroom.  Why do you ask that every morning?  I didn't sleep a wink. The tap in there never stops dripping.  What did he say?  I wish I could say the same.     I don't know how you can bear this country. What do you see that I don't?  Is this milk pasteurized?  But that's not true, is it? You're just lying to me right now  Is it? She looks at him.  To the bank. I . was going to the bank. Not that there's any reason to think something has changed. But our daughter, you see, she did promise, and one does try to remain optimistic. One has to. Otherwise    Oh god. Is it possible you feel the same? She brings his hand to her mouth, kisses it.  The way you talk to me. Your compassion, your understanding .. the wonderful, tender consideration, it had to be more than just -  As in ... happy? Graham says nothing. Jean lets go of his hand.  Yes. I see. Of course I see. The ghastly inappropriateness of it all settles on them both.  I appear to have humiliated myself. And embarrassed you.  Like I said. This country is driving me mad. Shall we go?        I can't stay in this country a moment longer.            . we should never have come. This whole trip is a grotesque fantasy. It's time to go home. Jean starts to pack. Irrationally, compulsively.   Look at us. A group of self- deluding old fossils traipsing around as if it's our bloody gap year. Humiliating ourselves     Yes, well. When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you.  You're very kind. But I rather think I'll turn in early. Goodnight everyone. She goes into her room.  Mrs Greenslade, might I have my husband back now? They spring apart.  Douglas? She walks off back into the room. Douglas turns to Evelyn.     Spare me your explanations. D'you think I'm jealous?  You were already doing a perfectly good job of embarrassing yourself. Can you imagine how ghastly it's been for everyone to watch you mooning around after that simpering doe- eyed ex-housewife, taking advantage of her loneliness and -  I checked my emails. This came. She hands him a piece of paper.  We're particularly well. Douglas, tell them our news. She looks to him, waits. He says nothing. So she turns, and smiles.  We're going home.  The whole thing is actually tremendously exciting. Not just getting on a plane, but getting on a plane and turning left.  First class. And home in time for our 40th wedding anniversary. We haven't yet decided how to mark the occasion.  Thank you. Evelyn turns, and walks away.       Douglas?  If you say one more word, I'll kill you with my thumbs.  This is ridiculous. It could go on for hours. There's no way we're ever going to get out of here.  You. Can you get us to the airport?  I'll give you everything I have.  Come on, Douglas. Come on! Douglas gets the suitcases out of the trunk of the cab.   What?   How about if I give you something else? My watch?  No.  He can do one person, and cases.  Could fate find a better way to tell us what we need to hear?  That it's over. It was over a long long time ago.  I have to go, Douglas.  No, you'll want to come after me. Chase me to the airport and tell me everything will be fine. But please don't. Because the truth is we both deserve more than we've had. You're just too kind and too loyal to admit it.  I will be alright. I'm turning left. She climbs onto the rickshaw. As the drumming intensifies, Douglas stands holding his suitcase, watching her weave through the traffic and out of sight.",
        "Muriel": "Listen, young lady. I want a cup of tea, and I want it now.  How hard d'you have to fall down before you get some proper attention? Hours I've been lying here, and not a single doctor has come to see me.  That one? She looks up to the far end of the ward, where a doctor is washing his hands. He's black.  He can wash all he likes, that colour's not coming out. I want an English doctor.  Easy for you to say, you're not having it.  I'm not getting it from you. 2nd Green Revisions I0/01/11 10.  Not any of your lot.  So when do I have the operation?  At my age, I can't plan that far ahead. I don't even buy green bananas.  Is it local?  You know who'll be there, don't you? Indians. Loads of them, A sea of brown faces and black hearts, all greasy haired and reeking of spices. Never see one on their own, do you? No, becuase they hunt in packs. All the better to rob me blind and -  You're supposed to see me into my flat. That's what they said.  No good moaning to me, mate. You married her! But he's gone. Muriel wheels herself on over the bumpy ground.  PG Tips. Brown sauce. Ten jars of Marmite. Thirty one packets of Chocolate Hobnobs. Pickled onions. Pickled eggs. And pickle.  What does that mean?  If anyone asks, say you're my mother. I don't want people to think we're together.  In your dirty dreams.  If I can't pronounce it, I'm not eating it. The cacophony of horns continues. Jean screams, as another collision looms.  There's an Indian in there! Graham smiles, goes on into his room. Which is dusty, but comfortable and pleasant. He looks around with satisfaction.  My what?  You're not touching me.  Have you got a marker pen on you?  I want to mark it. So you don't take the wrong hip.  Hell. I'm in hell.  When can I go back to England?  They must have got lucky.         Kill me. Kill me now. Sonny steers Mr Maruthi towards the reception, speaks quietly.     You won't get the dirt out like that. Anokhi just smiles at her radiantly.  I worked in service for years, looked after a lovely house. I kept it spotless. You need a bit more pressure on that brush. Graham walks past, on his way out.  Where d'you go every day? Is it a woman? Nip round there for a curry and a bit of afters?  Long old life, isn't it?  Public Records Office.  Where's this? Where are we?  What happened to my usual route?  You didn't tell me.  How soon can I leave?  I haven't been kind.  I'm not eating that.  I'd still rather a Scotch Egg. Then she sees something through the open doorway: the children have turned her wheelchair on its side and are spinning the wheels. She's on her feet in a flash.  Get off! Get off it, you dirty thieving bastards! Several terrified faces turn. One little girl starts to cry. Everyone is staring at Muriel.  I didn't see. They were playing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry        Glad to meet her family. Her grandmother. Her kids. Ajit translates. Anokhi speaks.  I looked after somebody else's. Ajit translates.  This one family, years I was with them. I ran the house, looked after the money, did it all, cared for them like they were my own. Ajit starts to translate. But Muriel doesn't wait.  That's the mistake, see. You don't want to get like that, to start feeling part of something. One day they decided I needed some help. I was grateful, I tried to teach her. Not just the books, but how to crisp up the bacon like the gentleman preferred it, the way the little one liked to have her hair brushed. The things you only know if you care. But then they said I was no longer useful to them. Thanked me for my service. As if that's all it was. I got a flat in the end. I'm the only one in the building not a foreigner. More Indians there than here! But before I came to this place, my biggest problem was what to do with all the time I had. Because that flat's so small, I can have the whole place spotless in half an hour. And then what am I supposed to do for the rest of the day? There's silence for a bit. Then Ajit speaks.  Give her these. Ajit hands Anokhi what Muriel gave him: a packet of Chocolate Hobnobs. This time it's Muriel who cannot meet Anokhi's eye. Tries to hide her desire to leave. Ajit turns her chair and pushes her away. Over this, the sound of singing  So there's a process, they call it pickling. I have no idea what it is, or how they do it, but whoever invented it was a smart man. But the real genius was the one who introduced an onion into the system. That I could never have thought of. Ajit looks at her, ready to translate.  No, forget it. Muriel is looking out at the yard. She sees Mrs Kapoor, talking to some surveyors. They're mapping out the building. Mrs Kapoor sees Muriel watching her, comes over to them.  I'm helping her clean. If these pots get any dirtier, you'll have to serve the food with penicillin.        Depends. Do you know how to use a computer?  Mrs Ainslie said she had an address where I could get some things I need. Some biscuits. She said I could get them on the line.  Do you want him to see you?  She's not back yet. Douglas stops. Beat.  Where d'you think you're going?  Already?  Doesn't have to. Silence. Everyone stares at Muriel. She takes out the spreadsheets.  I've been going over the accounts.  What he said to me, I imagine. She turns to Sunaina.  Can you help?  Depends how you read the accounts.  Turns out the original plan is good, it works. Just not in the hands of an imbecile.  What the place needs is more money.  He's reconsidered.  So long as there is someone to help the manager.        You're off your game. Lost your confidence, maybe. But you're a thoroughbred. You'll be back. Madge smiles.  And what about you, Mrs Greenslade? Evelyn has come down, unnoticed by all. Except Muriel.  We haven't talked much, you and  Most things don't. But sometimes what happens instead is the good stuff.  Haven't you got work in the morning? Evelyn nods.  Besides, he'll be back.  50,000 rupees says I'm right. At your current salary that should take you three months to pay off. Muriel stands up. Everybody stares. She starts to walk slowly but proudly across the courtyard. She reaches the doorway, turns back.  If you'll excuse me, someone's waiting to help me make mango chutney. Why did no one tell me about that stuff?  Why? Are you thinking of applying for the job? She gestures for her wheelchair. Sonny rushes up with it. She sinks down.  That's enough exercise for one day.",
