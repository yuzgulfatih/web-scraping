Bud listen to me. You're sitting in a car worth twenty thousand dollars. Look look we we turn it in we take the money and split it sixty forty. You and me.",
        "Miller": "You find one in every car. You'll see.   A lot of people don't realize what's really going on. They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidences and things. They don't realize that there's this like lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything. I'll Give you an example, show you what I mean. Suppose you thinking about a plate of shrimp. Suddenly somebody will say like plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp out of the blue no explanation. No point in looking for one either. It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness.   I'll give you another instance. You know the way everybody's into weirdness right now. Books in all the supermarkets about Bermuda triangles, UFO's, how the Mayans invented television. That kind of thing.  Well the way I see it it's exactly the same. There ain't no difference between a flying saucer and a time machine. People get so hung up on specifics. They miss out on seeing the whole thing. Take South America for example. In South America thousands of people go missing every year. Nobody knows where they go. They just like disappear. But if you think about it for a minute, you realize something. There had to be a time when there was no people. Right?   Well where did all these people come from? hmmm? I'll tell you where. The future. Where did all these people disappear to? hmmm?  That's right and how did they get there?   Flying saucers. Which are really? Yeah you got it. Time machines. I think a lot about this kind of stuff. I do my best thinking on the bus. That how come I don't drive, see?  I don't want to know how. I don't want to learn. See? The more you drive, the less intelligent you are.  John Wayne was a fag .  John Wayne was a fag.]  He was too you boys. I installed two way mirrors in his pad in Brentwood. And he'd come to the door in a dress.   People car pool, we'd be out of work.   Look at that car.]",
        "Napo": "Want me to take them?  Who the hell is this? Napoleon? Who the fuck  are you calling?  Ahh. Go fuck yourself asshole.]  Sixty-four Chevy Malibu. Twenty grand.   We could buy ten of them for that, Marlene.   Now how come this junk is worth so much? What's in it? Drugs?  Hey buddy! How you doing? Huh? Hey don't you remember me? I was here yesterday. Heh. Listen I think I left a book of matches over in your office over there. You want to go and check for me huh?   Hey thanks a lot buddy.  All right, you're beautiful. I love you.  Shit ! (?)!

    "description": "Frustrated punk rocker Otto quits his supermarket job after slugging a co-worker, and is later dumped by his girlfriend at a party. Wandering the streets in frustration, he is recruited in the repossession of a car by a repo agent. After discovering his parents have donated his college fund to a televangelist, he joins the repossession agency (Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation) as an apprentice \"repo man\". During his training, he is introduced into the mercenary and paranoid world of the drivers, befriended by a UFO conspiracy theorist, confronted by rival repo agents, discovers some of his one-time friends have turned to a life of crime, is lectured to near cosmic unconsciousness by the repo agency grounds worker, and finds himself entangled in a web of intrigue concerning a huge repossession bounty on a 1964 Chevy Malibu driven by a lunatic government scientist, with Top Secret cargo in the trunk.—Baroque <gopher_baroque@hotmail.com>",
