Just call me irresponsible...    Didn't you produce that foreign language hit that was remade badly in English?  Help me, Cherish. I'm stuck in a K-hole and I can't get out! CHERISH, firing her gun wildly, runs to LYLE and manages to pull him \"off set\" as HONEY freezes in terror deciding between her director or the POLICE. CHARDONNAY fires her gun and accidentally blasts her ears over earphone and lunges to turn down volume control on her Nagra.  (In character, trying to keep the scene going YEAH? Well your movies bite the big one! FAMILIES start throwing their concession stand candies at LYLE, CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES and advance towards them.   Film revolutionaries can never be stopped! PETIE brands him but LYLE feels no pain.  They wouldn't let you see R-rated films as a child!   No more per diems!   Drugs.. .give me drugs... RAVEN runs forward with a bottle of poppers and gives LYLE a snort. He smiles and twitches in final death rattle.",

Suddenly, like a low-rent Bat Cave, the large industrial garage doors swing open and the white limo speeds inside. 54. Dissolve to INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. HONEY's 54. \"dressing room\"; a bizarrely decorated prison cell fit for a movie queen. HONEY is blindfolded, gagged and tied to a director's chair with her name printed on the back, still wearing her torn and soiled premiere gown. LEWIS, now dressed in terrorist punk outfit removes HONEY's blindfold and gag as she sputters in terror. We see LEWIS has D-A-V-I-D L-Y-N-C-H tattooed on his fingers.

This is Cherish... CHERISH, now heavily made-up and dressed \"riot-girl\" style, in a \"SINEMA\" T-shirt, steps forward. We see \"Andy Warhol\" tattooed on her thigh.  Lyle? LYLE takes a big huff of glue in plastic bag and steps forward.

PAM the popcorn girl swaggers over carrying a beat-up vintage 16mm movie camera and aims it at HONEY's face. She is wearing a black para-military jump suit and we see her \"Sam Peckinpah\" tattoo on her arm.  Miss Whitlock, we're going to make our first film and NOBODY'S going to stop us. Lots of kids dream of making a movie... SPROCKET HOLES smile in brain-washed enthusiasm.  .but only the ones willing to dia for it succeed.

One day you'll thank me for saving you from your bad career.   .and ACTION! CECIL moves around stage, making cliche director's frame with his hands as PAM and CHARDONNAY rehearse camera and sound moves behind him. All the camera equipment has \"UNIV OF MD\" stenciled on it that has been scratched out half-heartedly.  (Banging his head on wall harder, insanely         That's more like it, Miss Whitlock! CHERISH gives HONEY a suddenly jealous look.   Let's move on!  The first take is the only real truth...  There are no rules in outlaw cinema, Miss Whitlock, only edges.

I'm trying to write, Cherish! HONEY, looking more relaxed, with only one leg cuffed to director's chair, watches herself on film in the arty, grainy, but very striking footage.

(In a booming voice to all the SPROCKET HOLES  Good morning, Miss Whitlock.  Whatever for? Your old career is over. . .but your comeback has just begun... CECIL nods to DINAH to start tape and we see a TEENAGE BOY on news in front of vandalized Timonium theater.  There are still some people who don't understand our work...

HONEY, out of her cell and unguarded for the first time, watches her \"stunt\" footage with pride as she gets the vodka bottle from their filthy dirty freezer and goes about the ritual of making the perfect martini. LEWIS, proudly displaying his brand, DJ's the music as CHERISH writhes in a sexy go-go dance for CECIL.

SPROCKET HOLES stare back at HONEY in a fast montage of their insane faces hallucinating credits of their favorite directors: William Castle, Kenneth Anger, Sam Peckinpah, Spike Lee, David Lynch, Fassbinder. FIDGET holds a pitiful fire extinguisher.  Your fans... HONEY looks to GROUPIE in a sea of cheering FANS. He is finishing up carving HONEY's initials \"H.W.\" in his forehead with a pop-top beer can tab.  .and for me, Cecil B. DeMented!

To be frank, Cecil, I would never do this picture in my real film life. The whole message is stupid - ask theater owners in any country and they'll tell you.

It was an innocent mistake.  .Honey Whitlock was always attracted to the wrong kind of man. It wouldn't surprise me if she was in on her kidnapping from the very beginning. She'd do anything for sex... HONEY howls in indignation as LYLE gives her a funny look. FIDGET pours her another quick martini.",
        "Raven": "Your mother sucks cocks in hell! HEAVY METAL KIDS look at each other in horror and run away in fear. Limo bumps down road at high speed and trunk door bangs shut, knocking HONEY into submission. Limo makes a fast right.  Hi, I'm Raven and I'm a Satanist. I'll be doing your makeup... HONEY stares back in confusion.  You look so pale... RAVEN suddenly slaps HONEY across face and HONEY cries out in shock.  Sorry... but Satan says... you need color! RODNEY, the biker \"bodyguard,\" now in S&amp;M leather get-up steps toward HONEY carrying a rat-tail comb and a hair dye applicator bottle. His \"Almodovar\" tattoo is a beauty.  I haven't had this much fun since my last livestock mutilation... RAVEN lunges towards HONEY's eyebrows and painfully tweezes out a hair.  \"In the House of Pain, there are 10,000 shrines.\" Allistair Crowley said that.                       Escape to what, Honey? My father is a Zo-Zo, the three-headed guard dog at the gate of hell!  And one day I'm gonna commit revolutionary suicide for celluloid...     It's not Honey's fault.              Satan loves you, Honey, and so do I. Tape cuts to LIBBY, HONEY's assistant, talking to ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT. Subtitle on TV read \"Honey Whitlock's Personal Assistant.\"     Who cares what anybody thinks of our movie except Satan?! HONEY, FIDGET and RAVEN pull GROUPIE away towards concession stand.",
        "Cherish": "Long live pornography!  Hi, I played you in lots of porno movies. \"Some Kind Of Happiness\"? I've already shot it - only it's called \"Some Kind Of Horniness.\" But that's all behind me. I'm an outlaw cinema girl now.   I didn't sell one ticket, Lyle. Nobody came!  I heard they were sold out last night, Mom!     I heard they were sold out last night, Mom.  (Primping with FIDGET'S help,          Come on, Cecil, I want a little \"action\" of my own!   How can you see me on film and not want to fuck me?!  Why not?! All my directors fuck me!  OK, in this scene you guys are the avenging angels of underground cinema...  Yeah, that Maryland is not safe for their kind of movies!   You think just 'cause you made \"real\" movies that you're better than me, don't you?  Do you know w I became a porno star?! SPROCKET HOLES groan, they've heard it before.     I guess you are. \"Jingle Balls, Jingle Balls,\" my stupid brother started singing. You think that's funny?   \"Fuck her!\" yelled my grandmother. How would you like that if it happened to you?!  \"Human pile,\" screamed my grandfather as they all jumped on! Do you know what a human pile is?! CECIL leads them up rickety steps to second floor trap door.  (Climaxing her tirade       Suffer for celluloid!  Outlaw cinema has no limits!  (Firing gun in air, pointing it at STUDIO EXEC A Didn't you just greenlight another new movie based on a video game?     My real life began in the cinema... PETIE brands CHERISH's arm.   And it will end in the cinema!  They've never rented a porno movie! FIDGET starts whacking nervously.   No more meal penalties!  Camera pans back to CHERISH's face smiling in relief at seeing her old flagship theater. CECIL, HONEY and SPROCKET HOLES stagger around corner and CHERISH beckons them to follow.  (VOICE OVER as camera pans her body Dear Diary, another day and the same old thing... everywhere I go-everything I do seems to lead to the same dead end... (She turns over to write on her stomach .my derriere... Cut to AUDIENCE of single men watching hornily as whole rows of seats vibrate from audience \"participation.\"  Hey buddy, I'm in a little bit of trouble...  Yeah, that's my ass alright and it's in trouble. Can me and my friends come inside?     Why is it that men only want my ass? (Takes her pet gerbil out of cage next to bed Do you know why, little Pellett? (Accidentally drops PELLETT in bed covers  (On screen, squirming around bed, trying to find her         Oooohhh, Pellett! You're just like all the rest! Oohh, Pellett! Oohhh! TEAMSTERS I &amp; J enter back of theater, look to the screen in sudden disgust and then spot CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES in AUDIENCE. LEWIS, CHARDONNAY, PAM, PETIE and RAVEN watch hornily along with moaning AUDIENCE as a frustrated FIDGET attempts to play pocket pool with his injured bleeding hand. Even HONEY is a little turned on and dares to catch GROUPIE's eyes again.       AUDIENCE's eyes bug out of their heads at seeing the real thing.     We're gonna get laid!",
        "Rodney": "Excuse me, ma'am, but Security's gonna have my ass if we're late...  Call me Rodney. Tomorrow I'm bleaching your hair out platinum and I should warn you...I FUCKING HATE ROOTS! PETIE, the sexy hillbilly \"chauffeur,\" now dressed in redneck militant garb and featuring a \"Fassbinder\" tattoo, steps forward.  From behind a curtain, covering a room of lab and editing equipment comes DINAH, now dressed in alarming vintage fashion outfit that shows off her shapely but purposely hairy legs. \"Sam Fuller\" is tattooed on her back. She wheels a TV set and VCR mounted on wheels framed by little velvet curtain.  You're going right off the deep end of the Clairol color chart! RODNEY squirts on more dye.  Beauty comes from agony! Everyone knows that!  Let's wash it out! RODNEY yanks HONEY's head back as RAVEN pours scalding water over her head.  I see a fucking root already! He lunges to HONEY's scalp with hair dye applicator bottle.   I see that fucking brown color...   That's just it, Honey! I'm not gay. I'm straight and I fucking hate it! Petie loves me but I can't love him back! I've tried! I kiss him and all I feel is beard.  (Suddenly snapping back  Make them pay for me thinking about pussy! RODNEY rips out a clump of HONEY'S teased hair with brush."

    "description": "In front of the cameras and in public, famed Hollywood actress Honey Whitlock, a product of the studio system, is as sweet as her name. Behind the scenes, she is demanding and controlling, making life a nightmare for anyone who has to deal with her, especially her browbeaten assistant, Libby. She and her entourage are in Baltimore - what is emerging as the Hollywood of the east - for the premiere of her latest movie. The premiere gets hijacked by a group of guerrilla independent filmmakers, led by director Cecil B. DeMented, in wanting to make a statement against the Hollywood studio system and the bad movies they produce. Cecil and his band kidnap Honey in the process. What their goal is, with no money per se, to make their own movie starring Honey as a statement against the Hollywood studios. Their general process is to have the scripted elements of the movie, such as Honey's dialogue, being set against \"real life\" in they overtaking several of the Hollywood movie studio events in Baltimore, such as the filming of the sequel toForrest Gump (1994). The main questions become if Honey, who is being forced to participate against her will, will truly change as a person and as an actress in seeing Cecil's vision, and how long Cecil and his group can continue in their kamikaze ways, overtaking the movie events in the city, in being the outlaws they have become.—Huggo",
