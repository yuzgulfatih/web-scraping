Let's play some cards...  ... and let's play some cards.  Why you bet a certain way is your business. But you have to make them think you're betting for a reason. Understand?  Seth. You know what you have. Looking at them doesn't change them. Leave 'em where they are and make your bet.  You're showing. Yeah, I know she's your girlfriend, Barry, but you can't... Thank you.  Josh.   Deal to your left.   (as Seth rakes in  It's been the longest hour of my life.    What's this?  What was his name, the bouncer's?  A card player with amnesia.    This should be fun.

If you're dealing with cash, you don't need a fence.  Probably everybody in cell block E.  I should hope so.  Guys: Day One: what's the first rule of poker?  That's right. My friend here just raised me out of pique. Today's lesson. How to draw out a bluff. This early in the game, that much money, I'm thinking he's holding nothing better than a pair of face cards. Seth, raise him.  Tophe...  Indeed. But be careful you don't push him too high too fast. Want to keep him on the leash. I call.  All you have to do is call.  Guys, you're free to do what you like. It's a lot of money. But I'm staying in. He's trying to buy his way out of his bluff.  We call.  Shit. Sorry, guys. I -- I was sure he was bluffing.     That was, that was just...  How was the clink? You get the cookies I sent you?  You barge into my new workplace, ruin my professional reputation, least you could do is tell me you've got something better for me.  How's Tess?  Alright.   Tell me.  Guns?  What's the target?  What's.    The.    Target.  What? You wanna knock over a casino?  If I'm reading these right -- and I think that I am -- this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed. Oops. Actually, you know what, I'm wrong. It's definitely the least accessible vault ever designed.  You said three casinos...  The Bellagio, Mirage, and... These are Terry Benedict's places.  More than somewhat.     You'd need at least a dozen guys, doing a combination of cons.  Well, off the top of my head, I'd say you're looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon Spinks. Oh, and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever. Where do you think you're gonna get the money to back this?  But does he have enemies with loose cash and nothing to lose... Aha.  Reuben.    So, here's what I think: You should take this plan, kick it around for a week or two. Sleep on it. Turn it over in your head. Then: never bring it up to me again.  I'm saying: this is like trying to build a house of cards on the deck of a speeding boat.  I need a reason. And don't say money. Why do this?  You're been practicing that speech, haven't you?  No, it was good.  I wonder what Reuben will say?  You're right. He's right.  That's exactly it. Pure ego.  I'd never been to Belize.  Say, you know, he's right.  What are we doing, Reuben?  Alright.   Who's in?  I talked to the Malloys yesterday.  They're both in Salt Lake City, six months off the job. I got the sense they're having trouble filling the hours.  Livingston Dell.  Livingston's been doing freelance surveillance work of late for the F.B.I. Mob Squad.  Okay. Not so bad you'd notice.  (next item on his  Dead.  Sun cancer.  Dated his wife a while.

What's with the orange?  So why don't you take vitamins?  I got a box seat. Come on.  I thought you drank bloody Mary's at the track, Saul.    Saul, you're the best there is. You're in Cooperstown. What do you want?  Guys like us don't change, Saul. We stay sharp or we get sloppy, but we don't change.  That your hound way in the back there?  It's a little more complicated than that.    -- which we can't fake --  -- which we won't get.  -- meaning if we manually override the lift, the shaft's exit will lock down automatically and we'll be trapped.    That's what I said.  Without being seen by the cameras.  Two.   And one of them is lonely.  Thanks, Charmaine. I'll have it back within the hour. Say hello to your mom for me.  They say taupe is very soothing.  Yeah...  For practice.    Okay.   Tell me about Benedict.  What do they talk about?  And that portfolio contains the codes to all the cage doors?  -- his brother-in-law's tractor dealership, I heard.  You scared?  Only in the morning. Now what?  Where's she come from?  Tess.  (looks very certain  But what doesn't beat the shit out of being a circus performer?  Tell me this isn't about her. Or I'll walk off the job right now. Tess. She's with Terry Benedict now. Tell me this isn't about screwing the guy who's screwing your wife.  Tell me.  Here's the problem: we're stealing two things now. And when push comes to shove, if you can't have both, which are you gonna choose? And remember: Tess doesn't divide eleven ways.  I've seen her happier.  Saturday day is yours. Do whatever you like with it.  Call is at five-thirty. Makeup and costume. Saul's package arrives at seven-fifteen, and Linus grabs our codes. All goes well there and we're a go. Seven- thirty Virgil and Turk deliver Yen and we're committed. From that point, we have thirty minutes to blow the power or he suffocates.  Once the electricity goes, all entry points to the vault and its elevator will automatically lock down for two minutes. That's when we make our move...  Okay: they've put you in the middle of the room, far from everything. You have to get from here to the door without touching the floor. What do you do?  We could --  For how long?  You boys have a nice trip?  Saul:   time to get out.  Now!    I did. I knew you couldn't leave Tess alone.  Ex-wife.  (eyes still on (the most difficult  It's that or we shut down right now. His involvement puts us all at risk.  You made it my call. When you put her ahead of us. You made it mine.  Not anymore.  Kid, you up for it?    Where you gonna put your hands?  No...  Not the pockets, either. And don't touch your tie. Look at me...  That how you gonna stand?  Wrong again. I ask you a question, you have to think of the answer, where you gonna look?  Death. You look down, they know you're lying --  -- and up they know you don't know the truth. Don't use three words when one will do, don't shift your eyes, look always at your mark but don't stare, be specific but not memorable, funny but don't make him laugh, he's gotta like you then forget you the moment you've left his sight, and for God's sakes whatever you do, don't under any circumstances --    You ready?  Linus... you're up.  Okay: when do you make the deposit?  (turning his attention   Okay. I'm counting down.    Thirty minutes of breathing time starts... now.  Did you make it out?     That's my cue. Give Basher the go.  Someone called for a doctor?  Hell, I think Reuben bought it, and he knew we were screwing around. You sure about this?  He's gone.    May I have a word with Mr. Benedict, please?     The man who's robbing you.  You're watching your monitor? Okay, keep watching.  In this town, your luck can change just that quickly.  Maybe.  No.   You're gonna carry it out for us.  Take a closer look at your monitor...  As your manager's probably reporting to you by now, you have a little over a hundred sixty million in your vault tonight.  You may notice: we're only packing up about half that. The other half we're leaving in your vault, booby-trapped, as a hostage.  You let our eighty million go, and you get to keep your eighty. That's the deal. You try and stop us, we'll blow both cash loads.    Hi.  He's fine. He wants you to go upstairs, and watch TV.  It's alright, Tess. I promise. Good. Here's what you do. Five minutes from now, the men in the vault are going to deposit six bags in the vault elevator.  If they meet anyone, we'll blow the money in the bags and the money in the vault.  One minute after that, the elevator will rise to your cages. Six of your guards will pick up the bags and carry them out into the casino.  If they take more than twenty seconds to reach the casino floor or if there's any indication a switch has been made, we'll blow the money in the vault and the money in the bags.  Of course, I'm in the casino. In fact, I'm staying in your hotel. And I have two words for you: mini-bar. Now as soon as your guards hit the casino floor...  ... a white unmarked van is going to pull up in your valet station.  Your guards will load the bags into the van's rear. If anyone so much as approaches the driver's door, we blow everything.  Now, when I get word that the van hasn't been followed, that the money is secure, my men will exit the building, and once their safety is confirmed, you'll get your vault back.  I would.  Yes?             Las Vegas P.D. This is Officer Brooks, New Jersey Probation Division. I have a violator in your jurisdiction... Hit it.  Looking for someone?  Hello to you, too.

Didn't expect to find you working wallets on the subway.  You're either in or out, right now.  A plane ticket. A job offer.  Bobby has every faith in you.  You do this job, he'll be trading on yours.  We'll get someone else who won't be quite as good. You can go back to feeling up stockbrokers.  That's the best lift I've seen you make yet.  America's playground.  Gentlemen:    welcome to Las Vegas.  Everybody eaten? Good. Everybody sober? Close enough. Most of you know each other already. You probably haven't met Linus Caldwell before, he's Bobby's kid outta Chicago.  Okay. Before we start, nobody's on the line here yet. What I'm about to propose to you happens to be both highly lucrative and highly dangerous. If that doesn't sound like your particular brand of vodka, help yourself to as much food as you like and safe journey. No hard feelings. Otherwise, come with me.  Gentlemen: the 14000 block of Las Vegas Boulevard. Otherwise known as the Bellagio, the Mirage, the M.G.M. Grand. Together, they're the three most profitable casinos in Las Vegas...  Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault. Located below the Strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth. It safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it. And we're going to rob it.  Courtesy of Frank Catton, new blackjack dealer at the Bellagio, security tapes from the three casinos.  Okay.    Bad news first. This place houses   a security system which rivals   most nuclear missile silos. First:    we have to get within the casino   cages --  -- which anyone knows takes more than a smile. Next: through these doors, each of which requires a different six-digit code changed every twelve hours. Past those lies the elevator, and this is where it gets tricky: the elevator won't move without authorized fingerprint identifications --  -- and vocal confirmations from both the security center within the Bellagio and the vault below - -  Furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors --  Once we've gotten down the shaft, though, then it's a walk in the park: just three more guards with Uzis and predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man. Any questions?  (smiles, happy   (off everyone's  Yeah.  Alright.   Here's how we'll begin.  First task: reconnaissance. I want to know everything that's going on in all three casinos. From the rotation of the dealers to the path of every cash cart...  I wanna know everything about every guard, every watcher, anyone with a security pass. I wanna know where they're from, what their nicknames are, how they take their coffee...  Most of all, I want you guys to know these casinos. They were built as labyrinths, to keep people in. I want you guys to know the quick routes out.  Second task: power. On the night of the fight, we're gonna throw the switch on sin city. Basher, it's your show.  Third task: surveillance. Casino security has an eye and ear on everything, so we'll want an eye and ear on them. Livingston...  Why do they paint hallways that color?  Uh-oh.  Well...  Fourth task:    construction...  We need to build an exact, working replica of the Bellagio vault.  Something like that.  Fifth task: intelligence. We need those codes, Linus. From the only man who has all three.  Learn to love his shadow. Sixth task: transport...  For now. You gotta walk before you crawl.       ... Power, surveillance, transport...  Get your wallet.  It's Armani, Saul.  Saul, you sure you're ready to do this?  You're ready.  There's a little over twenty grand there, Saul. Try to make it last.    Good luck, Lyman.  29:47.   Everything okay in there?  What is it?  Ex-wife.  It's not.   About that.   Entirely.  You said you needed a reason. Well, this is mine. When we started in this business, we had three rules. We weren't gonna hurt anybody. We weren't gonna steal from anybody didn't have it coming. And we were gonna play the game like we had nothing to lose. Well, I lost something. Someone. That's why I'm here.  If things go to plan, I won't be the one who has to make that choice.  How'd she look by the way? Tess...  (standing over her,  I'm out.  Of prison. You remember.

He got two steps closer to the door than any living soul before him.  Second most successful robbery. The Flamingo '71. This guy actually smelled fresh oxygen before they got him.  Course, he was breathing out of a hose the next three weeks, goddamn hippie.    And the closest any man has gotten to robbing a Las Vegas casino...  Outside of Caesar's in '87.   He came, he grabbed, he got conquered.    But what am I saying? You guys are pros, the best. I'm sure you can make it out of the casino. Of course, lest we forget, once you're out the front door, you're still in the middle of the fucking desert!  Yeah yeah blah blah.  Look, we all go way back. I owe you from that thing with the guy in the place, and I'll never forget it.  Give Dominic your addresses, I got some remaindered furniture I wanna send you.  Just out of curiosity, which casinos did you geniuses pick to rob?  (nostrils flared,  You guys... Whadda you got against Terry Benedict?  He torpedoed my casino, muscled me out, now he's gonna blow it up next month to make way for another fuckin' eyesore. Don't think I don't see what you're doin'.  You gonna steal from Terry Benedict, you better goddamn know. This sorta thing used to be civilized. You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you. Done. But Benedict... At the end of this he better not know you're involved, not know your names, or think you're dead. Because he'll kill you, and then he'll go to work on you.  Yeah, you gotta be nuts, too. And you're gonna need a crew as nuts as you are. Who do you have in mind?     What, you guys get a group rate or something?     You're Bobby Caldwell's kid, huh?  From Chicago?  It's nice there. You like it?  That's wonderful. Get in the goddamn room.  Anything I can do?  This looks familiar. Where'd you get this?  Danny!   Tell 'em not to touch the Rolls!          Where are they? That's what I want to know. Where are they?  (to himself, mocking  Who's Tess?  He's out?!  But, but... he can't just be out. Who's gonna take his place?  Good evening, Marcel. My nieces and I would like a table. Something quiet before the fight.  Quick as you can. The meter's running here.  (shocked to see Danny;    Enough monkey business."
