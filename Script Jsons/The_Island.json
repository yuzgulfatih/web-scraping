You know how it is. `Gets to the end of shift, `crew starts draggin t h e i r feet.  I guess if we bust our backs, we could be out of here by the end of the week.  Thanks , chief. I appreciate that.  What do you mean?  You mean, these things? Well, these things ain't good for you anyways.  That's because we ain't supposed to. They got rules about fraternization.  M o r e of the same. They cycle us onto the disposal detail. Hump `n dump crew.  D e b r i s clearance. We hump the heavy stuff to a site on the outside.  Right.    He y , take it from me, you got a sweet deal right here. So why worry, huh?",

    "description": "Set in a dystopian future, a group of people work in a facility, essentially as slaves. They do have an incentive though - a regular lottery is held and one of them gets to leave the facility and its restrictions and move to The Island, a paradise. Lincoln Six Echo is one of the workers in the facility and he is infatuated with Jordan Two Delta. His life is fairly uneventful and mundane until Jordan Two Delta gets selected to go to The Island. Then Lincoln starts to discover the truth about the facility and The Island.â€”grantss",
