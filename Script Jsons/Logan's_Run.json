        "Box": "Box is half-man...half-metal.  From the midpoint of his sternum to his hips he is coils and cables. One hand is a cutting tool. His head is half-flesh...half-metal. his legs are a chrome pedestal.   Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man...but a perfect fusion of the two...and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness...don't you agree?   Your turn.   Ah, but wait for the winds. Then my birds sing. My walrus breathes. My palace chimes and bells. And the deep grottoes whisper my name...Box Box...Bahhhhxxxxsss...   Anything to eat?  Box starts to laugh...He is roaring with laughter as:   I know...I know.   You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?  Logan contains his anger.  LOGAN (beginning again; quietly) Where do you think we came from?   From? From? From?   Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.   Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.   Never a pair. I have never had a pair.   You're a beautiful pair.   I've never seen humans whom I thought worthy of being here...  I'd like to sculpt you.  Where would I put you?  I know...you'd be the base of the column. You'd hold up my world!   Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years...or thirty thousand years...but thirty thousand thousand years...and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll...Ages. And you'll be here...the two of you... eternally frozen...frozen...beautiful.   Nude. Imagine, a pair.  LOGAN (starting to take off his clothes; as Jessica hesitates, Logan smiles It'll be all right...   Up there.  Logan helps Jessica up to the pedestal. As they stand there:   Up there.  Logan looks at Jessica. Her beauty is glowing in the lamplight.  Logan takes Jessica into his arms.   Enchanting. Is that what humans do?  By this time, Logan and Jessica are no longer listening to Box...their arms are enveloping one another...with strong feelings.   Superb!    As his metal hand begins to BUZZ...he brings it to the base of the huge column supporting the cavern.  As he works furiously...at Incredible speed:      Done...behold...!   Done...Done...Done...  Logan and Jessica break. They turn and see:    There are tears in Jessica's eyes as she reacts to the sculpture.  JESSICA (squeezing Logan's hand) It's glorious  Logan helps Jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress.    As Logan turns toward him.   Regular storage procedure...the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.   Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea. (pointing to the frosted ice wall It's all here - ready - fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea...And then it stopped coming and they  came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job - protein, plankton, grass from the sea  Logan pulls out his gun.   Such a beautiful pair. I'll stand you facing one another.  Box starts his saw hand BUZZING.  He turns all the flesh parts of his body away from Logan and starts advancing toward him and Jessica who is now standing behind Logan.  Box is now like an armed vehicle.  Logan FIRES...the fire reflecting harmlessly off Box's metal frame.   Resign yourself.    Advancing  We can SEE PERSON AFTER PERSON...embedded in the clear wall of ice. A strange mute audience to this to-the-death drama.    Relentlessly moving toward them.    Getting closer. The saw is BUZZING LOUDLY.   I make such a small, quick incision ... you can hardly feel it.    Box is practically upon them.  As he lunges forward with his WHIRRING saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down alongside her.  Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice out of the rear wall as:  Logan SHOOTS at Box from the floor Level...upwards ...trying to penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body. He misses but hits the exposed cables on the ceiling.  There is an EXPLOSION.  BOX (looking up; screaming) No! The coils!  Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern containing his sculptures.   All my work!' All my work!!  As Logan and Jessica stand:    Buried in his work, still feebly moving, then still as the roaring ice crashes down, in the terrible darkness.",
        "Mary": "I'm Mary 2.   Here.   I'm very smart.   I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.  As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's clothing...tearing a pin  off...and running away swiftly.  As Jessica instinctively starts after her...Logan... holds her back.",
        "2": "A glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the clouds  that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until the detailed structural  webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and  we see    The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the pool.  People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and fearful.    entering .  FRANCIS  (shaking     disbelief) You are here. I  couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?  LOGAN (still knocking     on the soundless glass) Turn this way.     (as one of the infants    stirs, smiles, bubbles) No,  no...not you...YOU!  Francis tries to pull Logan away from the  window, but Logan is intent on waking one of  the infants.    They are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced doorways,  each glowing faintly. They pause, waiting.     FRANCIS (peering at Logan curiously Why?    The door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them. They   move off.   Moving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the city  as it goes. slowing finally as we see:    Brightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car disappears  into a tunnel.    As the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a gathering  CROWD.    Glittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna Park --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every delight -- too  much to take in at a glance.    As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured argument continuing...    They are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in front of  her with his hands framing his face.    Signs promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streaming in and  out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing \"yes...yes...\" As she  passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from the crowd and CAMERA moves  with them.    An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of anticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and Francis entering,  waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see Francis. They embrace,  and as they break:   Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. ItÂ¹s  my Love-Shop turn.   You'll renew. I've got a feeling.   I feel the same way. Sometimes I think I'm not even going to try and renew when my time comes. But -- that's three years away. So long.  The 2nd Woman walks away.  FRANCIS (after a beat; to first Woman)    In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,  DANIEL, and fall in step with him. When they  speak now, their voices are hushed.    As the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding the people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last one enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it...       As he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns the man's left hand up. We see the flower crystal. Black. Logan takes out his transceiver.    Glances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his buttons.    Sucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once again bare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and away.    As he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.    As Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing.    Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes shape. It is Jessica.    Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile. Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches out a hand and leads her out into the room.    As Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen, who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. One of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them    There are three men and a woman seated at a table. Jessica reaches the table and sits down.      The man from the restaurant, following.    As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for Logan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound, hesitates, pretends to have stumbled.     As he speaks he leads her into the maze-car station and punches out his destination on the car caller.    As the two jam into the maze-car which rockets off in pursuit...  110-       Now the hatch opens. They step out, Logan first, Jessica timidly, looking around. Behind them the hatch closes, the maze-car sighs away into the distance.    Arcade shining like distant fireworks.    Below them a narrow, sharply angled concrete canyon, buttressed walls rising featureless. The look of an old fortress, blank, dim and cool. Still visible over an opening the chiseled legend \"Cathedral Plaza--2025 A.D.--Skidmore, Rosenfelt, Hennesy architects.\"  Jessica shivers, looking around her. Logan takes her arm and they descend into the canyon, move toward the wall. Their footsteps the only SOUND.    A room of angled, reflecting surfaces. At one end a jagged corridor, also mirrored, leads away. The zigzag, angled effect creates an absolute confusion of images. but Logan leads her unhesitatingly across the chamber to the corridor. Jessica hangs back, momentarily certain she's about to smash into something.    As they approach the end of the corridor, a small FIGURE in a tattered garment approaches them. She stops SINGING as she sees Logan and Jessica.    An area of rubble and dilapidated buildings.  Logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area, listening...  SOUND: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady.  Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the direction of the BEEPING, quartering occasionally like a hunting dog. Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off, puts the machine back onto his belt. He gestures to Jessica to stand still then he straightens, steps out, calls:    Suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed. At their appearance the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. Logan makes a futile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs.  A strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the pack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off trophies. He gestures to one of his followers to stand still.    Watching..terrified.    Being held against the wall by Cubs as:    moving a drugpad against Logan's face.  Logan is holding his breath...desperately trying not to breathe the \"Muscle\" directly from the pad into his system.    frozen for a moment. In f.g. a figure stirs, moves and we see it is Francis. His weapon is drawn and aimed, but as he watches, he lowers the barrel and smiles. The is Logan's job.     Walking past the GIANT LIFECLOCKS into the debriefing area.  The scanners begin moving.  Moments later the scanner stops...the word:    The waiting room has many mirrors...where customers ...male and female...are checking their faces .  There are also various photographs on the walls... suggestions for changes to foreheads, eyes, cheeks, lips, etcetera. The chatty informality is very much like people in a beauty parlor or barber shop.  There is a RECEPTIONIST seated behind a desk in a corner.  Logan and Jessica walk up to the desk.  The receptionist looks at Logan...ignoring Jessica.    His face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's bright face with its rapt look. She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's happening.    As laser blades cut into his face....followed by a spray of healing liquid on the cuts.    In terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons.      Brief glimpses of them looking for each other.    After a moment, Jessica takes Logan's hand and they start down in the darkness. The SOUNDS of Love Shop still heard from behind the wall.      They have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shines wetly in the darkness.    As he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt, punching out a signal.    As the Sandmen monitoring SEE THE SIGNAL FLASH and move smoothly into action.    Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenly heard:  VOICE (scratchy, filtered) Sandman, put your hands on your head.  Clasp your fingers together. Now turn your hands over. Palms up.  In a moment a light will shine in your eyes. Walk into it--Jessica first, then you, Sandman. You will have to stoop--but don't unclasp your hands. Do you agree?  Logan nods.  Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the dark. Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright, narrow rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely. Jessica moves forward. Even she has to stoop. Logan is close behind. As he bends awkwardly into the opening, the light goes out.    As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the side, pulling her with him.. The move fails. Both are pinned helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them. Logan is unable to draw his gun.   Is she the one?  OTHER VOICES (like angry stage whispers She betrayed us. Kill him. Kill them both. Jessica you sold us. Sandman butcher. Sandman murderer.  Logan and Jessica stand rigid against the spear points, only their heads turning to the echoing sibilants.. The spotlight goes off.      In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points, steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn. Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches.   You don't run. You kill runners. You have killed runners all your life.-    Reacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is Jabbed and pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer, shielding her with his body. But the spear points are too much. He subsides, as VOICES rise angrily \"Kill him now\".  Suddenly a RINGING ALARM. All sound stops at once and we hear a CLATTER of FOOTSTEPS down the iron stair and across the outer floor. The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the chamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands in front against the glare. It's Holly.      The spear points are withdrawn. Logan and Jessica relieved but shaken, wary.      As the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. They watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The Sandman is smashed away, burning.    Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his crystal can be seen from the room.    Francis, quartering the room like a hound, searching, searching, stopping as he sees    The crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness.    As he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads her off down the tunnel.    following the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but always down.    As Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into a kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense submarine hatch.  The tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door tands in a couple of inches of water.  With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door. Logan gives the wheel a tug...nothing.  SOUND: A WHIRRING like clockwork...A METALLIC BELL SOUND and then a   Hearing a SOUND they turn and see:    Far behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light and shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING    As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain.    now, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time.  Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which food was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowy labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness -- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting the huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed, rusted, rotted and wet.  In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc. The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now.  Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From an invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.    As he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.  But Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as it lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh. FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing    Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light. Finally, Logan gestures ''this way\" and sets out.  (NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible, sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the great wall...    A. Making their way along the walkway side by side.  B. Stopping as the walkway disappears under water. Logan wading in while she waits -- until he re-emerges. She follows.  C. Choosing between diverging ramps. Having to return.    moving, hunting.    Trying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must go back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly seeming small and distant.  As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall, suddenly:    looming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away.    Logan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion, somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancient machinery GROANS.  They turn and run as they HEAR:  FRANCIS (distorted; echo; etcetera   is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see:  THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Logan heaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes back and they are revealed.    aiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in his sights.    Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and pushes a half-drowning Jessica through.    A sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning when the waterlock door closes.  Logan slumps to the floor.    Moving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside - flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow. It is now very cold.  In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly, tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to move.    236x1INT. - ICE CAVERN  Suddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the side and revealing for the first time where they are.  236x2ANGLE  Before them a vase, dim, ice-shrouded storage area, row upon endless row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness, their legends and contents unreadable in the thick covering of ice and frost. To the side, a bright light.  236x3LOGAN AND JESSICA  Walk toward the light.  236x4WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA  We see a huge, high-domed cavern ringed and ornamented with extraordinary ice sculptures-They are everywhere: Otters, fish, a tusked walrus---overhead a flight of birds.  236x5ANOTHER ANGLE  As they look in wonder:      Box is half-man...half-metal.  From the midpoint of his sternum to his hips he is coils and cables. One hand is a cutting tool. His head is half-flesh...half-metal. his legs are a chrome pedestal.    Undresses.  Box motions to a pedestal covered with deep white furs.    As his metal hand begins to BUZZ...he brings it to the base of the huge column supporting the cavern.  As he works furiously...at Incredible speed:     ...oblivious to Box...their feelings intensifying as they continue to hold one another.        Before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and passionately.  Their mood is broken by:    Box has captured them perfectly...shimmering with life...filled with emotion.    There are tears in Jessica's eyes as she reacts to the sculpture.  JESSICA (squeezing Logan's hand) It's glorious  Logan helps Jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress.    As Box enters followed by Logan and Jessica.  This room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide.  It stretches back as far as the eye can see.  The ice along the left wall is frosted...but the ice along the right wall is perfectly clear.  And embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are:    Standing in erect positions.  At first it appears that they might be more of Box's perfect works of sculpture.  But as Logan and Jessica examine them closely through the clear ice...it is soon apparent that they are real people...who have been frozen.    Horrified as they move slowly along the wall.     As Logan turns toward him.    Retreating...as Logan FIRES again and again...to no avail.  As Logan and Jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of this room and:    Advancing  We can SEE PERSON AFTER PERSON...embedded in the clear wall of ice. A strange mute audience to this to-the-death drama.    Finally reaching the rear wall of this room as:    Relentlessly moving toward them.    Seemingly pinned back against the rear wall.  Logan is FIRING his gun futilely with his right hand...while moving his empty hand against the rear wall...trying to find a knob or button which might open it.  The entire time he never takes his eyes off:    Getting closer. The saw is BUZZING LOUDLY.    Against the rear wall...We can SEE...but they cannot...that above them...on the ceiling...there are a number of exposed cables.    Box is practically upon them.  As he lunges forward with his WHIRRING saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down alongside her.  Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice out of the rear wall as:  Logan SHOOTS at Box from the floor Level...upwards ...trying to penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body. He misses but hits the exposed cables on the ceiling.  There is an EXPLOSION.  BOX (looking up; screaming) No! The coils!  Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern containing his sculptures.    270x1ANGLE - THE REFRIGERANT COILS  Bursting open, discharging great streams of gases.  270x2LOGAN  Seeing the effect, shooting again and again at the ceiling and walls.  270x3ANOTHER ANGLE  Coils bursting everywhere, vapor billowing into the cavern.  270x4ANOTHER ANGLE  Huge slabs of ice instantly loosening, crashing over.  270x5FULL SHOT  AS the effect multiplies--Ln the hissing vapor-sculptures crashing over and enormous chunks of ice loosened and crashing.  270x6BOX  Careening around wildly in the growing ruin, as the lights dim and flicker out.    The ceiling full of birds loosening, crashing down upon Box. Again and again like great spears and wedges    Buried in his work, still feebly moving, then still as the roaring ice crashes down, in the terrible darkness.      The SCREEN blotted out by the cave-in, going out of focus. Silence. Then:  SOUND: Ice melting, water running.    Stir in the dimness, amazed to be alive.  SOUND: A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into the water.  As it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again. They look and see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by the last ice fall. Water rains across the opening.  Logan and Jessica make their way to it, step out.      Water is pouring down in a waterfall from the icemelt.  They are blinded by:    As Logan and Jessica shield their eyes...then realizing that the dazzling light will not go away:  Standing together...in fear of the sunrise.    clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge.    Suddenly, a FAIRLY STRONG WIND starts blowing.      Picking his way through the ruined cave, puzzled.     As Logan and Jessica reach it.  They are startled by the SOUND of BIRDS SINGING for a moment...then continue through some high grass and thorned bushes being scratched, etcetera.  A swarm of insects attack...Logan and Jessica fight them off:   Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica did.    They come upon bushes of berries. Logan picks a few, looks at them and smells them. As he is about to put them in his mouth...Jesslca grabs hold of his hand.    Sitting on the ground.  Jessica is shivering. Logan has his arms around her trying to keep her warm.    Looking frightened as he looks up at the moon and the stars his gun drawn.  Suddenly, a rabbit darts by.  Francis jumps up in great fear and starts FIRING his gun...blasting the rabbit to smithereens.  He is breathing hard ...and looking around...gun in hand.    walking in the hot sun...grimy...thirsty.    His face still betrays a wild, frightened look as he moves very cautiously.  He reaches the bushes of berries and sees some of them on the ground.  He picks a few off the bush...is ravenous...but finally...too frightened that they might be some kind of poison to eat any.  As he angrily crushes the berries in his hand... then wipes his hand on his trousers:    Seeing shimmering in the distance. They walk toward it.     Reaching...    They rush to it...drink...then undress...swim...and as they embrace in the water:      Coming out of the forest...climbing up a green hilly area...reaching the top and seeing:      Walking toward CAMERA to edge of swamp they stop and look at:      SOUND: HAMMERING NOISE -- irregular. It stops after a bit.  They walk to the door and open it cautiously.  They EXIT right.    Logan and Jessica walking down corridor, left to right.  The SOUND continues.    Logan and Jessica as Logan opens the aged door.      React, then they enter Senate and stop and look.     Coming through the opening - did he push it?    Holding up his right palm.    Jessica deeply disturbed...The man enjoying himself as if Logan and Francis were putting on a show for him.    A. Francis manages to pick up a chair and smashes it down on Logan.  B. As Logan slumps to the floor and Francis cries to follow through his advantage by crushing Logan's face with his foot:  C. Logan grabs Francis' foot and twists it...sending Francis reeling backward.  D. Standing, Logan grabs a table and hurls it at Francis...who ducks.  E. Francis sees a steel flagpole (with an American flag that has sixty-one stars) and takes hold of it.  F. Francis moves toward Logan...with the menacing steel flagpole in front of him.  G. Logan is wary...watching every movement of the steel pole.  H. Francis swings the steel pole twice...We can HEAR the WHISH-WHISH as it cuts through the air...with Logan avoiding the blows.  I. On the third swing...Logan grabs hold of the steel pole and swings around on it...kicking Francis in the chest.  J. Francis lets go of the steel pole as he staggers backward. Francis and Logan look at one another for a brief anguished moment as Logan crashes the steel pole  down on Francis' head.  K. Francis crumbles to the floor. Feebly, he raises a hand toward Logan...  Logan touches Francis' hand and Francis grasps his wrist, holding death off with the strong grip.    The man walks over to Francis and bends down.    quietly watching:      Walking up the beach toward the domed city. We get an idea of the scale. They appear as ants in front of redwood trees.    As the CROWD is pouring in:    On a high balcony in the Great Hall.  Looking down at them.       As around him in the air, a series of spectral greenish HEADS appear -- one after the other -in response to questions. Each of these heads is Logan. Each revolves slowly on its axis as it responds.  As the real Logan  is questioned, each of the heads answers in turn. They are each a part of his persona and his brain.    Rushing in from the Ready Room to join the others who have closed in on Logan One holding Jessica.    As people run in there, the red crystal glowing and sputtering, the petals moving spasmodically. As people look, the white crystal comes on, begins spinning wildly, bursting into strange, lancing lights. A great roaring commences and the whole arena starts to rock with the crystals. Now the white crystal explodes and the whole room is crisscrossed with deadly arcing discharges. People flee the scene of destruction.    A. EXT. The City under the dome -- fitfully lit as the dome itself seems to be cracking strange electrical discharges emanating from it as from a gigantic line storm.  B. The lights in Arcade flicker and go dim.  C. The chandeliers in Arcade swaying, a couple falling onto the screaming panicky people.  D. Maze-Car Station. People fighting to cram into cars. Car lights go out. People turn and bolt in another direction.  E. Love Shop -- pandemonium as the drugged bodies clamber over each other in fear, struggling to get away.  F. Great Hall emptying -- the signs of panic everywhere.  G. The great crystal -- a wildly spluttering electrical fire wrecking it.     INTERCUT with above:    Making their way through Cathedral -- out the dazzle chamber, running O.S. past Maze Car Station.    Running past Power Center.    We can still see the fires in the b.g. of the SHOT as Logan holds on to Jessica...(like Gable onto Jeanette MacDonald at the end of SAN FRANCISCO)...full of happiness and hope for the future.  AS people continue to mill all over the acres of strange stepped construction...we see the Old Man WALKING INTO THE SHOT.  Logan and Jessica run to him. He looks around. People start to gather...they have never seen a white-haired Old Man in their lives.  As people continue to gather around the Old Man... who couldn't be more delighted...Logan and Jessica are smiling...inviting people to touch him...and some do.  Yes, he is an old man...Yes, they will all live again to be old men and old women...Yes, this is the world renewing itself once again.",
        "Francis": "entering .  FRANCIS  (shaking     disbelief) You are here. I  couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?  LOGAN (still knocking     on the soundless glass) Turn this way.     (as one of the infants    stirs, smiles, bubbles) No,  no...not you...YOU!  Francis tries to pull Logan away from the  window, but Logan is intent on waking one of  the infants.   You should've seen me take my last Runner...perfect.     (Logan  continues to pound the      soundless glass) I backed him  up against a residence pool and  when he terminated...his hand...     (breaks off as Logan     is paying  no attention So now you've seen him...what's the difference awake or asleep?   Maybe,  maybe not. What's the difference? Come on,  Logan, let's get out of  here before everybody  finds out.  But Logan isn't moving. Francis gets an  idea.   Okay...you really want to wake him up?  Francis starts to pry at the Panel...knowing it  will sound an  You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor...Logan-6.  (putting a card key into a door which opens soundlessly) Not in my time...  They move through the door which closes.   Dunno...flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?  One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE _ appears on it. The  two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops. They enter it through the  doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHES softly off into a  kind of twilight.    The door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them. They   move off.   As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured argument continuing...   Well, why no!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -You have a better idea?   Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman  They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people to:  RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!  I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?  They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs promise:  LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT...here the people going in are simply  excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned out of their minds...   I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?   and that's my friend, Logan. (as she acknowledges the introduction We're celebrating his next in line. Carousel - Arcade - who knows? Want to come along?   You're thirty -- already? I always thought I was older than you -  Well, give it a good try.   I guess you never had her?  Logan shakes his head.   You missed something special.     They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters, moving  with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them, almost knocking  Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and they recover in time to see   the trio rip wildly through the crowd, knocking people down, screaming  with shrill joy as they disappear.   The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...  LOGAN (laughs cuffs Francis' arm What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than - (he breaks off as the lights in the Great Hall dim) -- come on, Sandman.  The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall.   In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,  DANIEL, and fall in step with him. When they  speak now, their voices are hushed.   Damn! That's right. Just when I feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in Arcade .   Only a few? You're just not trying.      Renew!    As the SCREAMING goes on in the b.g. of the SHUT... we hear a BUZZING noise. Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small, dark plastic box.  Logan looks at the box. On it we see:   I'm in my party mood.  Logan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the bleachers.  They make their way into the hall.  Logan takes out the small plastic box. We can tell from his face that he is disappointed...until a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates from the box.  Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction... the beeping stops. He turns in another direction... again, there is no beeping.  As Logan turns in a third direction...the BEEPING commences. Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPING GROWS LOUDER...AND LOUDER...until Logan and Francis see:  59-  Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?  Logan shrugs. He's not sure himself. Together they walk off down the hall, passing CAMERA    Descending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis is gesturing toward the Hallucimill.   ...Well I think you're getting stale. You need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell me it turns you inside out...  He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down.    I'll look for you here when I'm off--  And he is gone.   These are for me -- you've got your own.  She must have been something--?  At Logan's expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up an atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great pink cloud settles over them all.     You? Why? You're already beautiful.    appear on the SCREEN.   See you in the hydrotoner!  Logan nods.  Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death. Among them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry.  Logan is standing nonchalantly...as the scanner moves over the items...waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was earlier.  The scanner continues scanning.  Logan starts becoming impatient...but the scanning goes on and on and on.  Now...Logan is clearly puzzled...it has never...ever taken anything remotely resembling this length of time.  Suddenly, directly before him...on the SCREEN... the word:   What the hell took you so long?   I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.   Of course.   Look....why don't you get into the water....you need it....more than I do.   At Carousel tonight?  Logan nods, exits. The CAMERA REMAINS on a slightly puzzled FRANCIS for a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to:    Obviously enjoying the work, watching--tracking a Runner's progress, the assignment of a Sandman, the kill.    As the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message:    He is shocked, unbelieving.    Stunned and uncertain, Francis aims his gun toward Logan and Jessica...but he wavers...watching them disappear into the rubble...    shivering like a wet dog. He turns toward open window.  FRANCIS (in a firm, cold tone Runner!  The woman turns, staring insanely. Her mouth opens like a fish as: Francis FIRES his gun. A moment later, as the burning body topples to the floor;    After a long, long hesitation, takes out his small plastic box and starts to speak into it:   Runner terminated at G.16 Ready for cleanup at Cathedral Quadrant 39.    Gun in hand...running through Cathedral toward the maze-car platform.    Distracted...ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoring the city.    Walking past the GIANT LIFECLOCKS into the debriefing area.  The scanners begin moving.  Moments later the scanner stops...the word:   Can you beat it....I've got the damn wrong bag.   Yeah....    Entering...gun in hand.     What's going on, Logan?!    What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go?  I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!  Suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smoke and noise, momentarily drawing Francis' attention. Instantly Logan jumps him, grabs and throws him sprawling. Without a look back, he and Jessica run out.    Enraged, finds his gun on the floor and, before rising, gets off a shot at them as they disappear. Then leaping to his feet, dashing off in pursuit.    Entering, starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughing Wantons.    Hunting both.    Desperately trying to get rid of a woman, sees a flash of Logan and Jessica far across the room -sees them leave. Then he's pulled down again as the orgy continues.  186-   At the mirrored archway, looking around carefully, testing. He knows they went through somehow. Hands claw at him - he brushes them away as he searches.    The crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness.   (believing the blinking crystal is Jessica's) Logan. I know you're in here. Runner?  Nobody knows except me. You know I won't say anything. I should have turned you in but I couldn't. Leave her. Come on out with me. It'll look like you're part of the group that hit this nest.  Logan...you're a Sandman!  Logan...now...now...Logan...  After the slightest beat, Logan FIRES and Francis falls, a great chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue.    As he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.  But Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as it lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh. FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing    looming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away.    is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see:  THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Logan heaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes back and they are revealed.    aiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in his sights.    Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and pushes a half-drowning Jessica through.    Picking his way through the ruined cave, puzzled.   Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica did.    Looking frightened as he looks up at the moon and the stars his gun drawn.  Suddenly, a rabbit darts by.  Francis jumps up in great fear and starts FIRING his gun...blasting the rabbit to smithereens.  He is breathing hard ...and looking around...gun in hand.    His face still betrays a wild, frightened look as he moves very cautiously.  He reaches the bushes of berries and sees some of them on the ground.  He picks a few off the bush...is ravenous...but finally...too frightened that they might be some kind of poison to eat any.  As he angrily crushes the berries in his hand... then wipes his hand on his trousers:   What did you do to him?  Jessica is silent. Francis' tone becomes increasingly sexual.   Why? Why you?  Do you know you ruined him? Do you know that? Can you tell me why? Why you?  And now you've killed him, you know...  Francis starts to tear off her clothes...obviously to rape...but his expression remains cold and without passion.   Here!!!!  Logan looks up...and we see Francis crouched behind the railing of the first row of the gallery...with his gun pointing down at Logan, holding the terrified Jessica with his other arm.    Looking at his palm....shocked...dropping his gun. It falls on the  Why did you do that??!!    In hand to hand combat punching...Kicking...wrestling   That was the right shot--Look out there, he's trying to break free Watch it, Logan, steady, now!......  His eyes focus briefly and he sees Logan's palm-the crystal shining clear and white. Francis is suddenly radiant.   Logan! You renewed!  And he is dead.DIRECT CUT TO:",
        "Old": "It disappears and words on SCREEN now read:   Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.   Yes indeed, everyone.

You know?   Yes...   Mother and Father said so... you know?   Dead...they're dead...and buried.  JESSICA (not knowing what it is Buried???  Logan wheels...as he HEARS THE NOISE OF A DOOR SQUEAKING SLIGHTLY...as it opens a bit wider:   May I see your hand again?  Logan and Jessica extend their left hands. The Old Man takes them, looks from one to another with delight.   They're beautiful. May I have one too please?   It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats...a Jellicle cat.  \"Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise.\"    What kind of jewel is this?

Did you steal this?    \"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.\"   No, no, no   Never, never, ever. Nothing.  After a pause:   Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.   All this. All of it.   I don't know...but it does.  The man stands...and starts walking toward a door to an adjoining room.   I'll be right back.  Oh, yes...about the cats... one rule is true:  \"Don't speak till you are spoken to.\"  The man smiles and leaves.   Oh, my don't cry.  The man proudly shows them the portrait....which is a portrait of himself in his twenties. He sort of brushes the hair...which is rich auburn.   There are larger pictures of other people over there. I don't know who they are. Perhaps they're family.  She man leads Logan across the chamber to a far corner.   How nice...more company...  FRANCIS (emotional; disjointed thoughts) We had such good times together... I let you go!  You didn't terminate a Runner and I let you go!!  She did this to us! How could you let her?! An ordinary available??!! (with this he flings Jessica down and away. She lies there...stunned And what about Logan-6 and Francis-8?  ....Why didn't you chink about them?!  There's over two hundred years of Sandmen's blood in you, Logan.... and now you'll spill it for a stinking Runner!!   Oh, my...he died...   WeÂ¹ll have to bury him.   TheyÂ¹re put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...  LoganÂ¹s eyes are glistening with tears.  The man starts out.   IÂ¹ll make the arrangements.   Are you ready to put him in?   All right.  The man sits down.  Gently, Logan lifts FrancisÂ¹ body...trying to straighten him out from the slightly twisted position he assumed when he fell to the floor.  After resting FrancisÂ¹ body on the floor again.  He cradles FrancisÂ¹ head in his arms.   \"Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night.\"   Of course...that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...   What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.   Where are you going?   Alive?  Logan nods.   Thousands and thousands...as many as my cats?   And all alive you say?  Logan nods.   Yes, I would like to see that. Is it a long journey?  Again, Logan nods.   Thousands and thousands alive... oh, my...   Never see the sun or the moon... I hope we get there soon...   That's better than gold when it's cold.   My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. \"Beloved\" is a word they used - to stay together.   Oh, yes...I think...  JESSICA (reading; moved) Â³Beloved sonÂ²...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?    Walking.    As they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the distance.  The Old Man marvels at what he sees...they walk on.    Walking up the beach toward the domed city. We get an idea of the scale. They appear as ants in front of redwood trees.    Approaching. The wave power inlet in f.g. They   Oh...I did so look forward to seeing all those people.   Yes...   Oh my...I'll try.   Oh, my...  The Old Man watches Logan and Jessica dive into the POOL and disappear.    he bends and plays with the water in the POOL for a moment...like a young child at a pond or lake.",
        "Man": "Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.    Emotionless. Aims. Fires.    Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.   Well? How do you like it?   I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little -   Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?   Too little.   Too little?  Too little. Okay, wait for me.  And he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glances around,  smiles and goes off with a passer-by.   Only if I make it to the top of Carousel.  Thirty -- and the big spin.  In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her a  half-squeeze.   You know I always have.  Another beautiful WOMAN joins them.   Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. ItÂ¹s  my Love-Shop turn.   That's all right. Happy turn.   You'll renew. I've got a feeling.   So do I...but if I don't at least I'll have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost rather have that than renew.   I feel the same way. Sometimes I think I'm not even going to try and renew when my time comes. But -- that's three years away. So long.  The 2nd Woman walks away.  FRANCIS (after a beat; to first Woman)   Um-huh.  They look briefly and then she turns away. Francis takes Logan's arm and  they move off.   At the highest level...straining for the rainbow...    Almost a blur...but still straining:    The blur...but still there...straining with all his might for the rainbow...      running.  CHASE: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following the running man in the great hall...empty. We can HEAR the CROWD SCREAMING in Carousel offstage.  A. Logan and Francis separate...to encircle the running man.  B. The running man turns a corner and for a moment Logan cannot see him.  C. As Logan turns the corner...Francis is on the other side and FIRES at the running man...JUST MISSING HIM.  D.Francis winks at Logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp and Logan gets it:  A little cat and mouse is in order.    E. Logan FIRES... just missing the man...Francis FIRES again. . . just missing, too.  F. The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp...to various levels and areas.  G. Both barrels  glow again as they FIRE...with both just missing the running man once more.  H. The man's face is crazed...and sweating...the mouse is going berserk as he has been chased to a high level.  I. He stands frozen, petrified, driven to the edge of a high balcony by the shots--teetering now. He is in full sight of Logan, Francis is across the hall.  J. The RunnerÂ¹s face. He looks at death twenty feet away--Logan aims.  K. Francis, watching, smiling at the perfect moment.  L. Logan's face. A shadow of thought, a hesitation.  M. The Runner lunges. Logan fires, misses.  N. Francis fires a salvo, drives the Runner back to the rail where he teeters again, throws his hands in front of his face and plunges. The SCREAMING in Carousel reaches a peak.    The driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on one of the arms of the vehicle. There is a broad spray of vapor from the bottom which covers the corpse.    Satisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the SHOT. As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into its place.    Glances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his buttons.    Sucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once again bare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and away.    A frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper, fronted by broad steps. Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a SANDMAN is coming out... His uniform is in tatters. They greet one another...then:   I lost a Runner in Cathedral.   Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage.  One of them cut me bad... (extends his arm and moves a finger from his shoulder to his wrist all the way down.   On my way to the New You for repairs.    As Logan and Francis cross, turn into a corridor.    As Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen, who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. One of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them   What's with you, Francis?  FRANCIS (touching his head; grimacing Last night  The other Sandmen, including Logan, smile as Logan and Francis continue to:    Black door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth room. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE,   Logan is on the steps, irresolute. He looks at his blinking crystal...moves as if to reenter, changes his mind. Now takes out the black box, dials.   She says she's been here before...    Eating without enthusiasm...obviously more interested in their conversation.   He's blinking...so what? Sandmen get old, too.   But what if he's telling the truth?   I say no. It's not worth the risk.   I absolutely agree. He's killed Runners for a decade. He has no feelings.   Neither do we.    Four Sandmen at the consoles. They look up as Francis enters. He goes to one of the men who stretches, yawns, gets up.   Thanks, Francis.  FRANCIS (taking his place at the console Just don't be forever about it like last time.   Ah-h you love it. You're afraid you'll miss a really good Run.  They all laugh. Francis takes up his watch as the other exits.    Leaning together talking in an undertone   If he believes you, he'll come.   Why? It's our only chance--kill him and get away in the crowd heading for the evening slaughter --   No - just there - on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.   You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?  Slowly, Jessica nods.   Tonight?   I think you can. Don't you?  Jessica faces her squarely, nods. The woman looks deeply into her eyes, relaxes.   I'm sorry. We all are. But he has heard about Sanctuary -- and that makes him dangerous to all of us.  After murmurs of agreement:    We're counting on you.  Jessica exits. They look at each other in dismay.. After a moment, one of the men follows her. They don't trust her.    Walking slowly up to a door, she hesitates, KNOCKS.  Logan opens the door, reacts.   Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight-- why don't you--  But Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The others ad lib interest-- \"watch out in there--they can cut you before you see them\" etc.    frozen for a moment. In f.g. a figure stirs, moves and we see it is Francis. His weapon is drawn and aimed, but as he watches, he lowers the barrel and smiles. The is Logan's job.    WOMAN (nearing hysteria There's been a terrible error! My Lifeclock must have broken in some way!  I'm nowhere near thirty...look at me...I'm twenty-two. I should be green! Did you hear me?  Green!   I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!!  After Logan pushes her away...and she falls down:   I almost believed her.  They move off soundlessly. Behind them, a maze-car has arrived.    Distracted...ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoring the city.   What happened?!  Francis hesitates....then....quickly, as if changing his mind, taking the items off the table:   You ought to put yourself on reliefcall, Francis.   Is this your first time?  Logan and Jessica nod.   This is my third...  ... I did it when I turned yellow ... and green.  I turned red yesterday.   No. But I hear he's terrific. Have you seen any of his work?

But it wasn't your color either.  ...or yours. I have my color somewhere.   Oh, no...   Oh, my...please try.  Jessica walks up to the man and touches his face.   I've forgotten. It's been so long since I've used it.  Logan and Jessica exchange a quick glance...feeling they have come upon a nutsy, fruitsy cupcake.   But all of my cats have names.   Yes, cats, of course.

There are larger pictures of other people over there. I don't know who they are. Perhaps they're family.  She man leads Logan across the chamber to a far corner.   How nice...more company...  FRANCIS (emotional; disjointed thoughts) We had such good times together... I let you go!  You didn't terminate a Runner and I let you go!!  She did this to us! How could you let her?! An ordinary available??!! (with this he flings Jessica down and away. She lies there...stunned And what about Logan-6 and Francis-8?  ....Why didn't you chink about them?!  There's over two hundred years of Sandmen's blood in you, Logan.... and now you'll spill it for a stinking Runner!!    Jessica deeply disturbed...The man enjoying himself as if Logan and Francis were putting on a show for him.    The man walks over to Francis and bends down.   Oh, my...he died...     WeÂ¹ll have to bury him.   TheyÂ¹re put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...  LoganÂ¹s eyes are glistening with tears.  The man starts out.   IÂ¹ll make the arrangements.   Are you ready to put him in?   All right.  The man sits down.  Gently, Logan lifts FrancisÂ¹ body...trying to straighten him out from the slightly twisted position he assumed when he fell to the floor.  After resting FrancisÂ¹ body on the floor again.  He cradles FrancisÂ¹ head in his arms.   \"Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night.\"   Of course...that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...   What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.   Where are you going?   Alive?  Logan nods.   Thousands and thousands...as many as my cats?   And all alive you say?  Logan nods.   Yes, I would like to see that. Is it a long journey?  Again, Logan nods.   Thousands and thousands alive... oh, my...   Never see the sun or the moon... I hope we get there soon...   That's better than gold when it's cold.   My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. \"Beloved\" is a word they used - to stay together.   Oh, yes...I think...  JESSICA (reading; moved) Â³Beloved sonÂ²...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?    Walking.    As they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the distance.  The Old Man marvels at what he sees...they walk on.    Walking up the beach toward the domed city. We get an idea of the scale. They appear as ants in front of redwood trees.    Approaching. The wave power inlet in f.g. They   Oh...I did so look forward to seeing all those people.   Yes...   Oh my...I'll try.   Oh, my...  The Old Man watches Logan and Jessica dive into the POOL and disappear.    he bends and plays with the water in the POOL for a moment...like a young child at a pond or lake.    It is the same area where Logan received the original assignment to find and destroy Sanctuary.  In the rear...with the panel open...the sign reading:    Sandmen rushing out through the gathering smoke and the flare of fire behind them.    Sandmen pouting out through smoke and fire effects. Pushing through passers-by herding everyone away from the scene.  People getting the hell out of there.  Ad Libs: Get away from here. The whole thing's going.    The building EXPLODES -- great geyser of flame shooting upward.",
        "Sanctuary": "Logan takes a breath.    As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the side, pulling her with him.. The move fails. Both are pinned helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them. Logan is unable to draw his gun.    In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points, steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn. Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches.",
        "Woman": "I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little -   Too little.   Only if I make it to the top of Carousel.  Thirty -- and the big spin.  In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her a  half-squeeze.   You know I always have.  Another beautiful WOMAN joins them.   Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. ItÂ¹s  my Love-Shop turn.   That's all right. Happy turn.   You'll renew. I've got a feeling.   So do I...but if I don't at least I'll have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost rather have that than renew.   I feel the same way. Sometimes I think I'm not even going to try and renew when my time comes. But -- that's three years away. So long.  The 2nd Woman walks away.  FRANCIS (after a beat; to first Woman)   Um-huh.  They look briefly and then she turns away. Francis takes Logan's arm and  they move off.   Eating without enthusiasm...obviously more interested in their conversation.   I absolutely agree. He's killed Runners for a decade. He has no feelings.   Neither do we.    Leaning together talking in an undertone   You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?  Slowly, Jessica nods.   I think you can. Don't you?  Jessica faces her squarely, nods. The woman looks deeply into her eyes, relaxes.   I'm sorry. We all are. But he has heard about Sanctuary -- and that makes him dangerous to all of us.  After murmurs of agreement:    frozen for a moment. In f.g. a figure stirs, moves and we see it is Francis. His weapon is drawn and aimed, but as he watches, he lowers the barrel and smiles. The is Logan's job.    WOMAN (nearing hysteria There's been a terrible error! My Lifeclock must have broken in some way!  I'm nowhere near thirty...look at me...I'm twenty-two. I should be green! Did you hear me?  Green!   I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!!  After Logan pushes her away...and she falls down:   Is this your first time?  Logan and Jessica nod.   This is my third...  ... I did it when I turned yellow ... and green.  I turned red yesterday.   No. But I hear he's terrific. Have you seen any of his work?",
        "Doc": "who looks about twenty-one years old, exchanges a pointed look with Jessica.   It's a real privilege, Sandman.   And I did it myself right on there.   I designed it myself.  What'll it be ...a face job or a full-body job?   Fine....Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.  Holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on Logan's tunic.  As Holly brushes her fingertips lightly down Logan's arms:   Holly works here because she gets a lift out of watching the Table...  and other things. I'll be back in a minute.   You shouldn't have brought him here.   Run!? He's a Sandman.   Maybe...Maybe. But I wish he'd gone somewhere else.  All right. He gets a face.   All set?   Why not?  Doc pushes a button...there is a tiny FLASH.   Do you have anything special in mind?   Hurry...hurry...hurry.   Holly'd like a lot of things.  We can start by narrowing the cheekbones.  Doc presses buttons on the control board. Jessica, who is standing next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM...as a pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach.  CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces and shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points.  A vibrobeam begins to KEEN.  SOUND: An insistent chiming.  Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's been called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-like apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. The table and the laser heads stop moving.    Hello  Yes  Yes, they are. (listening; his expression changing Done.  Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan, then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his look registers, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machine again...   Pay attention, Sandman. I'm proud of this machine.  As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position near Logan's face. It pauses as   With this one there's no waiting for scar burnishing. It's all in one...watch now...  The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a bright trail of blood as   But here's the improvement. Instant healing---before you feel a thing. Watch now...  Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track, spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is moist and whole.    who is playing the console as he speaks.   Perfect depth adjustment on this one, Sandman. The beam will cut through that uniform and just exactly through the skin beneath-- absolute precision. Watch now  And the machine does its stuff, slashing through Logan's tunic--a seam of blood following the rip.   Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms, Sandman, but otherwise it does everything, doesn't it? Just imagine what would happen to you if the healing stopped functioning.  And the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid into Logan's new wound. Again the blood disappears.  Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious. He turns off the healing switch and punches buttons fiercely. The laser arms begin to move wildly and the SOUNDS become shrill. Holly looks alarmed.   Damn right! It was a trap. They know!    Watching intently as:    Shocked as Logan reaches for his gun.    In terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons.",
        "Billy": "Don't worry about her. We'll have that one later. Right now I think we've got a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner!  The CAMERA PANS the other Cubs...mean, filthy.   I cut up a Sandman yesterday.  They said I'd never get him...but I cut him up good, I did.   For me? Better feel sorry for your- self, Sandman!   Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!   Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!  Logan falls back into a fighting crouch...but before he can strike a blow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned building.    moving a drugpad against Logan's face.  Logan is holding his breath...desperately trying not to breathe the \"Muscle\" directly from the pad into his system.   He's trying to hold his breath...  As Billy presses the pad tighter against Logan's face:  With all his might, Logan wrenches his arms loose... drops to the ground and pulls out his gun.  He fires and fire girdles a pillar...and they start to back away.   We can rush him...we can take  can take himagain, we can!!  The pack hesitates...stops backing away.",
        "Customer": "Is this your first time?  Logan and Jessica nod.   This is my third...  ... I did it when I turned yellow ... and green.  I turned red yesterday.   No. But I hear he's terrific. Have you seen any of his work?",
        "Sandman": "Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.    Emotionless. Aims. Fires.    Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.   I lost a Runner in Cathedral.   Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage.  One of them cut me bad... (extends his arm and moves a finger from his shoulder to his wrist all the way down.   On my way to the New You for repairs.    As Logan and Francis cross, turn into a corridor.    As Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen, who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. One of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them   What's with you, Francis?  FRANCIS (touching his head; grimacing Last night  The other Sandmen, including Logan, smile as Logan and Francis continue to:    Black door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth room. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE,   Logan is on the steps, irresolute. He looks at his blinking crystal...moves as if to reenter, changes his mind. Now takes out the black box, dials.   She says she's been here before...    Four Sandmen at the consoles. They look up as Francis enters. He goes to one of the men who stretches, yawns, gets up.   Thanks, Francis.  FRANCIS (taking his place at the console Just don't be forever about it like last time.   Ah-h you love it. You're afraid you'll miss a really good Run.  They all laugh. Francis takes up his watch as the other exits.    Walking slowly up to a door, she hesitates, KNOCKS.  Logan opens the door, reacts.   Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight-- why don't you--  But Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The others ad lib interest-- \"watch out in there--they can cut you before you see them\" etc.    Distracted...ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoring the city.   What happened?!  Francis hesitates....then....quickly, as if changing his mind, taking the items off the table:   You ought to put yourself on reliefcall, Francis.    As the Sandmen monitoring SEE THE SIGNAL FLASH and move smoothly into action.    It is the same area where Logan received the original assignment to find and destroy Sanctuary.  In the rear...with the panel open...the sign reading:    Sandmen rushing out through the gathering smoke and the flare of fire behind them.    Sandmen pouting out through smoke and fire effects. Pushing through passers-by herding everyone away from the scene.  People getting the hell out of there.  Ad Libs: Get away from here. The whole thing's going.    The building EXPLODES -- great geyser of flame shooting upward.",
        "Jessica": "Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile. Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches out a hand and leads her out into the room.    As Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her- but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely, is amused and surprised.    Please . . .No.  She backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling.   No.  Just no.   No.   Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.   A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.    He was killed   Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.   Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself on the circuit.   Jessica.   No.   No.   I thought I had to do something.   I changed my mind   Curious.   How a Sandman lives.  Logan smiles, takes off gunbelt, etc.   Not about that.   I'm afraid to tell you.   Why is it wrong to run?   I suppose. But what if you want to live?   Six. I go red next year.    You could have called me yourself.    Here I am.  Shall I come in?  Logan gestures, leading her inside to the living area.   I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?   Thanks...but I have the choice.   Then it's still no.  Logan laughs.   You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?   I don't believe you. There has to be more.   Why show me?   About running, dying what?   I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.   How can I?  Logan takes out the ankh.   Where did you get that?   And then you killed him, right?   I don't..   Please? What friends?   I never heard of a Sandman running . . . ever. . .  LOGAN (putting the ankh in his pocket; dropping the bombshell And I never heard of Sanctuary.  Jessica reacts. She is about to speak. . .doesn't..  Logan reaches out and touches her hand.    Eating without enthusiasm...obviously more interested in their conversation.   He was born a Sandman. He had no choice.    Leaning together talking in an undertone   Why Arcade Station?   Right at the station itself?   Y-yes...if I can find him.    Making her way through the strolling crowd, her face thoughtful.    Walking slowly up to a door, she hesitates, KNOCKS.  Logan opens the door, reacts.   What do you need?  A moment, then Logan moves toward her hungrily, pulling her in to him as the door closes.    Walking along a handsomely landscaped stream. Laughing together, stopping to admire the beautiful fish .   What're you going to do?    I wish I could help you.    I wish I knew what you think I know.  Logan smiles at her, both knowing what's false, but drawn to each other anyhow. They commence walking again.     Of course--   We're coming to Arcade. - Shall we Relive together?    As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for Logan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound, hesitates, pretends to have stumbled.    Suddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them. Logan looks at her searchingly.    As he speaks he leads her into the maze-car station and punches out his destination on the car caller.   You're not going, are you?     Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.  LOGAN (interrupting, grimacing) Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.   Some people say children need human mothering.   I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?   I have.   I don't remember exactly...except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?   I've never been in this quadrant.  Is that Arcade off there?  There are standing on the maze-car platform -- a high overlook like an \"elevated\" station.   Muscle? I don't know that one.  Logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor. It's stop and go--a fun house in which you can get hurt.   Don't be afraid.  We see that it is a little GIRL of seven. Her face is grimy and hair is tangled.   What's your name?   Where do you live, Mary?   Why aren't you in Nursery?   When do you go up?    Watching..terrified.    watching    At the flash of FIRE from Francis' gun, they turn. Logan and Francis' eyes meet. A beat, then Logan grabs Jessica and pulls her away.     I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.   Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.   Yes, but they won't know that...or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...   I - I can't.   No. Not that either.  Logan considers her. A long BEAT. Thinking, then:    as they enter NEW YOU #483 they are being watched by:   I didn't bring him -- what's the difference. He's blinking. He wants to run.   I tell you he's running. I know.    As they face Francis.      Suddenly she pulls him in another direction.   Follow me, Logan. Stay close.  As they run into Hallucimill...Francis...never too far behind... spots them and follows.  168-   Exiting from the other side...and running through the crowd toward and into a Love Shop...followed by Francis coming out of the Hallucimill, too... and running toward the Love Shop.    As they enter the hot darkness. The Love Shop is throbbing with sexuality. In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when booths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing an orgiastic tableau. The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random flashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding and stunning the viewer. Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings and as they do, a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan, pulling and laughing:    Brief glimpses of them looking for each other.   Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your--   He's good, isn't he?   They won't believe us.   They wonÂ¹t listen.   We'll convince them.  They pause. He puts his hand over hers. Jessica is silent. Then she turns his hand over. The crystal blinks red -- on, off.   Yes, Logan.  I'm glad they didn't change your face.  Logan embraces her, but his look is strange and remote. They continue down into the darkness.  Behind them the SOUNDS of Love Shop die away and only their footsteps are heard.    They have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shines wetly in the darkness.   Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.   They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.    Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenly heard:  VOICE (scratchy, filtered) Sandman, put your hands on your head.  Clasp your fingers together. Now turn your hands over. Palms up.  In a moment a light will shine in your eyes. Walk into it--Jessica first, then you, Sandman. You will have to stoop--but don't unclasp your hands. Do you agree?  Logan nods.  Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the dark. Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright, narrow rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely. Jessica moves forward. Even she has to stoop. Logan is close behind. As he bends awkwardly into the opening, the light goes out.    As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the side, pulling her with him.. The move fails. Both are pinned helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them. Logan is unable to draw his gun.    In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points, steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn. Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches.   What's the matter with you. He's a runner-- he's blinking. We must help anyone who asks...we must-or we're the same as they are--deciding who lives and dies.  One of the points lifts and touches Jessica's cheek. A quick, fierce burn. She shrieks--a tiny sound--and is silent.   No, Holly--wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!  HOLLY (suddenly exhausted He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me--and the machine blew up and I ran...I ran   Holly. Holly! Please...The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after--  Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid.  HOLLY (pouring it out) That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!  JESSICA (coaching desperately) ...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...   Why?- No...no...I'm going with you.   I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary. With you.  A BABBLE of VOICES. \"Impossible\"...She ignores, watches Logan.   Will you take me with you?    As the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. They watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The Sandman is smashed away, burning.    As he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads her off down the tunnel.    following the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but always down.    Hearing a SOUND they turn and see:    As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain.   Every key only works once...and only a Lastday key must open this door.... They said it would fit - but....  She tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes. Logan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into the dark pool of water. They fall to their knees, searching desperately. Then Logan remembers.   There's no turning back, is there?  Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door... following her... as the door closes and they are:    Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light. Finally, Logan gestures ''this way\" and sets out.  (NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible, sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the great wall...    A. Making their way along the walkway side by side.  B. Stopping as the walkway disappears under water. Logan wading in while she waits -- until he re-emerges. She follows.  C. Choosing between diverging ramps. Having to return.   How do we know this is the right way?   What do you suppose this was...?   Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.  Logan shrugs, but the idea makes him queasy, too.  G. They stop, tired. Peer through at the wreckage of a small inspection vessel and suddenly hear:  SOUND: FOOTSTEPS, coming, halting, WATER sloshing. Steps again.   It's Francis, isn't it?  He nods.    Trying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must go back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly seeming small and distant.  As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall, suddenly:    Logan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion, somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancient machinery GROANS.  They turn and run as they HEAR:  FRANCIS (distorted; echo; etcetera   Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and pushes a half-drowning Jessica through.    Moving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside - flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow. It is now very cold.  In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly, tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to move.   I'm afraid.   Wait.  He halts.   I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?   You're really one of us now, aren't you?   I wanted to... (Logan puts his arms around her) ...And you...what made you kill Sandmen?   Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.   For us.  Logan mouths \"Us\"...a strange word...and why not... in the last minutes he has done strange things.   It's incredibly beautiful.   We're human and we're hungry.   Please.    Undresses.  Box motions to a pedestal covered with deep white furs.    ...oblivious to Box...their feelings intensifying as they continue to hold one another.    Before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and passionately.  Their mood is broken by:    There are tears in Jessica's eyes as she reacts to the sculpture.  JESSICA (squeezing Logan's hand) It's glorious  Logan helps Jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress.    Horrified as they move slowly along the wall.    Retreating...as Logan FIRES again and again...to no avail.  As Logan and Jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of this room and:    Finally reaching the rear wall of this room as:    Seemingly pinned back against the rear wall.  Logan is FIRING his gun futilely with his right hand...while moving his empty hand against the rear wall...trying to find a knob or button which might open it.  The entire time he never takes his eyes off:    Against the rear wall...We can SEE...but they cannot...that above them...on the ceiling...there are a number of exposed cables.    Box is practically upon them.  As he lunges forward with his WHIRRING saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down alongside her.  Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice out of the rear wall as:  Logan SHOOTS at Box from the floor Level...upwards ...trying to penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body. He misses but hits the exposed cables on the ceiling.  There is an EXPLOSION.  BOX (looking up; screaming) No! The coils!  Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern containing his sculptures.      Stir in the dimness, amazed to be alive.  SOUND: A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into the water.  As it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again. They look and see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by the last ice fall. Water rains across the opening.  Logan and Jessica make their way to it, step out.   Is there something on fire!!  Logan shakes his head...he doesn't know.  As Logan looks up at the sun.    clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge.   What's that?   And yours.  They reach the level below and pause, look around.   I hate outside! I hate it!  LOGAN (holding her; comforting tone We'll be all right...  We will...  The sun is starting to go down...as they see a rabbit dart away in the grass...startling them for a moment.    They come upon bushes of berries. Logan picks a few, looks at them and smells them. As he is about to put them in his mouth...Jesslca grabs hold of his hand.   Don't!   It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.    Sitting on the ground.  Jessica is shivering. Logan has his arms around her trying to keep her warm.   Where do you think that heat-ball went?  Logan shrugs.   Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?   Don't ever let go.   Do you think he was telling the Truth?  Logan shrugs.  JESSICA (trying to convince herself) Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.    walking in the hot sun...grimy...thirsty.    Seeing shimmering in the distance. They walk toward it.    Reaching...   Logan!!!Look!!  No...your palm...look!!!   Logan looks at his palm...the blinking crystal is clear.  He grabs Jessica's hand and looks at her palm... the same.   What does it mean?  LOGAN (trying to assimilate its meaning himself The Lifeclocks have no power outside.  Jessica takes Logan's palm and kisses it.   You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?   ...But I still have the choice...?   Then the answer's Yes...  They embrace there in the water...    Coming out of the forest...climbing up a green hilly area...reaching the top and seeing:    Walking toward CAMERA to edge of swamp they stop and look at:    Exiting CAMERA RIGHT toward Memorial    Climbing steps of memorial toward statue.    Looking up at statue.    Looking up at statue.   Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad---?  Logan shrugs. They turn, start to EXIT from memorial.         As they pass the stones, Logan glances at them.   \"Beloved Husband\". \"Beloved Wife\". What can all that mean?  Just then their attention is focused by a distant SOUND as of SHOUTING -- a man's voice. Jessica stops.   Francis?  Logan shakes his head. They EXIT cemetery toward capitol.    Walking up the steps...many of which are cracked.  They are proceeding with great caution...as they enter the Capitol Building.    SOUND: HAMMERING NOISE -- irregular. It stops after a bit.  They walk to the door and open it cautiously.  They EXIT right.    React, then they enter Senate and stop and look.    Those cracks in your face...do they hurt?   Could I touch them?   What's your name?   But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.   And...and how were you grown? Inside your mother?   Are you sure?     Here you can have this.  The man seems pleased.   I don't know.   No.   What belongs to the people?   What people?    Logan clears two chairs of cats and they sit down.  Jessica picks up a book and starts leafing through it.  Logan is deep in thought.  Jessica looks up from the book.   How curious people used to be -- All these books...  Silence...until:   He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.   We're going on, aren't we?   There's a Sanctuary...there is!    Remaining near the podium. She is dejected. Logan's argument that there is no Sanctuary has sunk in and taken hold.    As Francis suddenly appears alongside her.  Jessica is terrified...speechless. Francis glances across the chamber, sees Logan. When he speaks, it is softly but urgently.   Logan!!!  As she screams, Francis clamps a hand over her mouth and drags her   Jessica deeply disturbed...The man enjoying himself as if Logan and Francis were putting on a show for him.    The man walks over to Francis and bends down.     WhatÂ¹s that?   At least itÂ¹s over...  JessicaÂ¹s words donÂ¹t help as Logan shakes his head...then:    quietly watching:   We'll remember. But that's a long time off...  She sees Logan awake and listening, crosses to him, smiling. Logan rises to her.   He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.   To what?   You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!   Things won't change...you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!   You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!!  Logan shakes Jessica who is becoming hysterical.   I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.  Logan puts his arms around her.   Come with us.   And Sanctuary?   Beloved husband...     As they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the distance.  The Old Man marvels at what he sees...they walk on.    Walking up the beach toward the domed city. We get an idea of the scale. They appear as ants in front of redwood trees.    Approaching. The wave power inlet in f.g. They   What does that water do?   Is it inside the city?   Goodbye.    Emerging from the water.  It is a labyrinth of humming turbines, automonitored cables and impulse collectors.  Logan leads her swiftly through the humming maze toward an exit.  369- 369Xl OUT    Making their way through Cathedral -- out the dazzle chamber, running O.S. past Maze Car Station.    Running past Power Center.",
        "Logan": "Screenplay By  Producer: Saul David  Director: Michael Anderson  Production Design: Dale Hennesy  April 30, 1975    Logan is twenty-five, strong, virile  with a kind of austere grace.  He is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery window  into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPING INFANTS. Logan is  KNOCKING on the soundless glass.   Wake up...come on, Logan-6.   Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every  day that a Sandman son is  born. I'm telling you, Francis  - that's him!   Hey, cut that out !  Too late: There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES. The area in which they stand  is bathed in a violet glow. Logan grabs Francis firmly and stops him from  prying at the panel:  Now you've done it...  The CHIMES STOP...but the glow continues, a metallic VOICE is heard:   Logan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.   Even the alarm didn't wake him.  As Francis starts out:  LOGAN (one last look; joining Francis All right, Francis...I'm with you.  They move off down the corridor...the lights behind them DIMMING as they  pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, CHILDREN automatically  tended.  CHIMES...soft. A lullaby and a soothing impersonal VOICE.   Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?   just wondered...what happens?    The door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them. They   move off.   As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured argument continuing...   but you don't know, you Just say what everyone says.  One for one. One for one.\"   No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that \"one for one\" song  of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher With a stuck tape.   Did you ever see Francis-8?   Of course not! I m curious, not sick.   The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway. Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group.   Well...you can't have them all.     They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters, moving  with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them, almost knocking  Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and they recover in time to see   the trio rip wildly through the crowd, knocking people down, screaming  with shrill joy as they disappear.    In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,  DANIEL, and fall in step with him. When they  speak now, their voices are hushed.   You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I  recognized him -  FRANCIS (hustling Logan Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...  DANIEL (glances at his own red crystal, nods Yes. Me, too. You know we're both on Monitor tonight.   Want me to take your shift? I'm feeling restless anyway  Francis glances at him, exchanges a look with Daniel. They vanish into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and we see   Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.    Caught up in it Like the rest.    Standing. SCREAMING their cheers as:      Renew!    As the SCREAMING goes on in the b.g. of the SHUT... we hear a BUZZING noise. Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small, dark plastic box.  Logan looks at the box. On it we see:    Looks like I'm working.  Francis stands.   Who invited you?    As he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns the man's left hand up. We see the flower crystal. Black. Logan takes out his transceiver.    Scowls for a moment, then shrugs. He takes out a small flat pouch and methodically strips from the body its few personal things, stuffs them into the pouch. Then his eye is caught by the man's right hand, clenched. Logan opens it. A metal ankh on a bit of chain. It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and closes it. Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into it softly.   Runner terminated 0:31  Ready for cleanup.  Done with his job, he rises to face Francis.    That was a great shot you made.    Descending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis is gesturing toward the Hallucimill.    waves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill.    Hesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way. He looks and we see:   Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards the exit.    As he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.    Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes shape. It is Jessica.    Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile. Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches out a hand and leads her out into the room.    As Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her- but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely, is amused and surprised.   What's wrong, Available?   Please . . . no ? (noting that she looks trapped, he understands You mean \"not here\"--that's it? You're a private Available but particular, (he is moving in on her as he speaks, she retreating, which amuses him Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.   You prefer women?   Well then...?   Sad? What made you sad?    Yes...probably he was renewed?   Killed? Why do you use that word?   I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate  Runners  Who brought you?   You felt sad. What's your name?    You're beautiful. Let's have sex.   Later.   But you put yourself on the circuit!   And?   And now?   About what?   Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.    I'm listening.    I'm not armed.  Well?   You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to -   So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.  Logan stretches out his right hand. We see a red flower crystal embedded and centered in his right palm. It is exactly the same shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner.   When this turns black...that's it.  If for any reason you want to be 31... you have the same chance as everyone else...Carrousel.  Logan takes his gun and points it at her.   But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.  JESSICA (somewhat frightened I didn't say that I would run... I Just...  LOGAN (interrupting; turning over her palm Are you a 5 or a 6?    You're years away . . . I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?  Jessica shakes her head. Logan looks at Jessica carefully...in an admiring sexual way...from her toes to her head...briefly noticing chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry that he has taken off the dead runner...around her neck.   What Quad do you live in?   You're sure you don't want to try?  Jessica nods.   It's nice to know you can nod.  Jessica smiles.   It's nice co know you can do that, too.  Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young WOMEN burst in and come laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowd around Logan one of them embracing him. In the wild hilarity, Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort after her. Francis notices, laughs. Amid the noise he shouts to Logan:   What happened to you?   How come?   Get yourself a new face while you're at it They know you now.  They wave. Logan and Francis continue.   I just might look in on New You 483 myself.   No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.   Negative. Question: What is it?  Words on SCREEN now read:   Negative.  Words on SCREEN now read:   I don't understand?  Words on SCREEN now read:   Question:  Word on SCREEN now reads:   1056 unaccounted for?!  Word on SCREEN reads:   Impossible!  Question: Maybe they weren't all Runners. Maybe most of them reached Life Renewal on Carousel.  Words on SCREEN read:   Question: None of them reached renewal?  Word on SCREEN reads:   But everyone believes that some....  Words on SCREEN read:    Question: You mean nobody's ever been renewed?  Words on SCREEN read:   The Seal......  Question: The Seals? Go outside?! But there's nothing outside!  The words on the SCREEN read:   I will.  The words on the SCREEN read:   Question:  What if I need help from another Sandman?  The words on the SCREEN read:    Question: I am six Red...how can I pretend to be approaching Lastday?  The words on the SCREEN read:   My Lifeclock...  Question: My Life--  Before the startled Logan can finish...he feels a shock of pain and his hand is immobile. Logan stares at the back of his hand as if it wasn't his. His forehead shines with sweat.  Now the entire area, including the chair and the screen begins to glow bright red. The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forced to close his eyes.  As the glow subsides...Logan looks at his right hand. The red flower crystal in his palm is blinking. He stares at it, fascinated, fearful.   Question:  Am I still six Red?  The words on the SCREEN read:   I know that but I had four more years  This means ten days to Lastday. Of course I will get the four years back, won't I?  The words on the SCREEN read:   Question: Do I get my four years back?  Too late. The SCREEN is BLANK. For a moment his lips part as if to say something more but he changes his mind, turns away.  Now Logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh. Almost automatically, he starts moving his hand toward the groove...but the SCREEN already has the words:    Logan looks at it - then:  The CAMERA PANS Logan out of the mammoth room.... past the GIANT LIFECLOCKS....where he pauses.... glances at his BLINKING CRYSTAL....and continues out into:    Did you ever see anybody renew?   Did you?   Anybody we know?    I'm fine....  See you....    Location...female Green Six... name Jessica...living in Quad K.    Logan opens the door to see Jessica. Behind her a young SANDMAN who has obviously escorted her there.   She has.  Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smile widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off.   But I wasn't sure you'd come.   I couldn't get you out of my mind.   Maybe...sure....   Of course.   You know   All right.  Logan extends his right hand. He turns his right palm so that. Jessica can see it blinking red.  Jessica gasps for a moment...then:   I'm going to run.  JESSICA (after reacting Why tell me?   You know something.   Both...running's what I'm interested in.   It's different now. Help me.   A Runner gave it to me.   I let him go...believe me.   Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...   (clutching the ankh, looking at Jessica's; then: I don't have much time.   What can I do to make you believe me?  Jessica draws her hand away quickly from his touch.  Logan stands and starts out...as Jessica watches him..    A distance away...watching.   Are you here to help me?    Walking along a handsomely landscaped stream. Laughing together, stopping to admire the beautiful fish .   That's tomorrow.    Maybe you'll chink of something...     If you did know, you'd tell me.   If you trusted me, you'd know.    Suddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them. Logan looks at her searchingly.   Tell me, Jessica.  Behind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises his hands. One more step... Logan senses something, half-turns just as we hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver. Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes the transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side, Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessica cranes her head to see too.    The Sandman at the console turns and says:    As he speaks he leads her into the maze-car station and punches out his destination on the car caller.   A Runner...Cathedral. A woman.   Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.  The maze-car arrives and they move to it.  JESSICA (touching his arm I'd rather be with you.  LOGAN (knowing she is lying through her teeth That's nice.  They enter the car which instantly moves off. As it passes, the men in ambush come forward and read the destination. They ring for another car which pulls in immediately.  107-    Have you ever been through Cathedral?  Jessica shakes her head.   They're like beasts. Wild.   Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.   Uh-uh.    When did you begin to question Lastday?   Let's see - how long has it been?  As Jessica turns her head...looking somewhat guilty, the maze-car slides to a stop.  A warning light pulses on the car's console and a RECORDED VOICE speaks before the hatch opens.   Let me go first. Sometimes they're waiting just inside there--to rush you when it opens...   Quickly now--  He helps her through the narrow opening--the portal's walls are very thick.. They turn abruptly and see:   Just follow--no matter how it seems...  JESSICA (doing her best But what is this--why?  LOGAN (as they enter the corridor) The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's  no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us--  too fast   It's unauthorized. No good for any- one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you to pieces--speeds everything up to a blur--  you can see what happens when some flying Cub tries to go through this on muscle--splat!  Jessica reacts...to what Logan has said...then:  A moment later:    Not here. Might be a decoy.  Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into-   Runner!  Silence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the Runner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure is shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of surrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on and off. The Runner is a woman!  There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly Jessica gasps, grasping at him.  As Logan whirls:   I'm a Sandman!   I feel sorry for you, boy!  Some murmuring as the pack watches their leader.   No, for you! How old are you, Billy?  Billy is silent.   Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months? (he points to the yellow flower in Billy's palm What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?   No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!    Being held against the wall by Cubs as:   (moving the gun slowly back and forth All right! How many of you want this to be Lastday?!  The pack moves back again...and  disperses, leaving Billy facing Logan alone.   Come on, Billy...come on...you cut a Sandman, didn't you?!  Logan tucks the gun back into his waist.   Come on, Billy...cut me...Come on  After a beat, Billy turns and runs away.  Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the small box from his pocket and turns it...until it starts BEEPING.  The CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessica...following the SOUND.  They move over the rubble...and cautiously around abandoned buildings.  We HEAR A SCREAM...and HEAR the Cubs who've only obviously found and attacked someone. The SOUND is coming from a different direction than where the beeping is coming from.    They've got someone else! Why would anybody come here?  Jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly.  The BEEPING is now very loud.  Logan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly to a door inside and kicks it down.  We SEE the Runner. The WOMAN cringing, expecting death.    frozen for a moment. In f.g. a figure stirs, moves and we see it is Francis. His weapon is drawn and aimed, but as he watches, he lowers the barrel and smiles. The is Logan's job.    WOMAN (nearing hysteria There's been a terrible error! My Lifeclock must have broken in some way!  I'm nowhere near thirty...look at me...I'm twenty-two. I should be green! Did you hear me?  Green!   Don't be afraid--  Before Logan can continue...the Woman...who is now wild-eyed and hysterical lunges at Logan...and starts grappling with him.   I'm not going to hurt you.  Slowly, she rises.  Logan takes out the ankh.   Sanctuary? Anything?  Logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round object...the size of a large marble.   If they find you throw this hard enough to break it. Then hold your breath till you get away...It's blind gas.  Her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks Logan again.  During the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again.  Jessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds her. Eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small round object...she appears somewhat bewildered as Logan and Jessica move off.    At the flash of FIRE from Francis' gun, they turn. Logan and Francis' eyes meet. A beat, then Logan grabs Jessica and pulls her away.     Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?   All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.   That's nothing...there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.   Then - why don't you leave me - go to them - explain   All right. New You 483. I'll find out myself.    as they enter NEW YOU #483 they are being watched by:   Hello.   A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?   It's all right with me. Is he here?   No - Look, I'm in a hurry.   Beautiful work. This man do them all?   Just one.   Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I ex- pected a Red.  DOC (showing his palm; the flower crystal is Red I am.   Your own work?   Just the face.   Do I have to undress?    Logan lies down.  The Table ripples...accepting his weight prisoning and positioning him.   I don't care...Just get it over with.   Holly'd like dark hair.    His face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's bright face with its rapt look. She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's happening.   No - I'm Running!  Machine begins to WHINE LOUDLY.  Jessica tries to turn the machine off...Doc starts to wrestle with her as:    Moving.    As surgical beams slit his shirt from the shoulder to the waist leaving two threads of blood.  A vacu-head dips to suck the blood away neatly.    As Logan desperately sucks in his belly....trying to flatten himself into the Table.    As laser blades cut into his face....followed by a spray of healing liquid on the cuts.    As two wide blades of light sweep downward....and hover three inches above his neck....and keep lowering ....HUMMING loudly....and one inadvertently frees Logan's right arm.    As dozens of laser beams slash toward Logan....he twists away....and breaks off....jumping off the Table.  Doc rushes Logan holding what appears to he a frozen police billy.  In an instant he has knocked Logan's gun away....and as Logan looks down at it....we see it lying on the floor completely frozen.  Slowly, Doc moves toward Logan the short smoke-colored stick menacing in his hand.   What I told you is the....  Abruptly, Doc lunges toward Logan...missing him as Logan ducks away.  As Doc turns to attack....Logan smashes his elbows into Doc's chest and Doc falls back onto the Table.    Making an effort to stop the machine, pulling levers and pushing buttons in vain. He sees what's happening, pulls Jessica away from Holly and, grabbing up his gun and tunic, heads for the entrance. Crossing the waiting room they are stopped by the sight of:  158-   As they face Francis.     It has nothing to do with you.    Suddenly she pulls him in another direction.    Exiting from the other side...and running through the crowd toward and into a Love Shop...followed by Francis coming out of the Hallucimill, too... and running toward the Love Shop.    As they enter the hot darkness. The Love Shop is throbbing with sexuality. In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when booths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing an orgiastic tableau. The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random flashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding and stunning the viewer. Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings and as they do, a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan, pulling and laughing:    As she tears at his clothing, wrapping herself around him, trying to pull him down. Then, as the light flares again she suddenly lets go and grabs another man...Logan is, freed, starts looking for Jessica.  177-   Brief glimpses of them looking for each other.    As he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and sees it's Jessica. Now together they make for an archway where multiple mirrors enclose them.  Suddenly they are in darkness. Then a heavy door slides open and Jessica leads Logan through the opening. Behind them the door slides shut again.   Are you taking me to them?   Because he's my friend -  and I don't want to be killed by him - or anyone.   Will he find us and kill us? Yes...or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...    I'd rather take my chances with them...than with Francis.   You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,    They have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shines wetly in the darkness.   How will they know we're coming?    As he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt, punching out a signal.    Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenly heard:  VOICE (scratchy, filtered) Sandman, put your hands on your head.  Clasp your fingers together. Now turn your hands over. Palms up.  In a moment a light will shine in your eyes. Walk into it--Jessica first, then you, Sandman. You will have to stoop--but don't unclasp your hands. Do you agree?  Logan nods.  Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the dark. Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright, narrow rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely. Jessica moves forward. Even she has to stoop. Logan is close behind. As he bends awkwardly into the opening, the light goes out.    As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the side, pulling her with him.. The move fails. Both are pinned helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them. Logan is unable to draw his gun.    In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points, steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn. Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches.   I'm a runner. She brought me here because I begged her to help me.  He turns his palm. The red crystal blinks impressively in the darkness.  At the sight, a BABBLE of SOUNDS. Argument.   Yes I have.  Now it's my turn. And I want to live.  Another angry murmur of VOICES. Over it Jessica suddenly:    Reacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is Jabbed and pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer, shielding her with his body. But the spear points are too much. He subsides, as VOICES rise angrily \"Kill him now\".  Suddenly a RINGING ALARM. All sound stops at once and we hear a CLATTER of FOOTSTEPS down the iron stair and across the outer floor. The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the chamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands in front against the glare. It's Holly.   May we move?  A long beat. Then--   I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.   I Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?  A murmur of discussion then:    No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. (suddenly his tone is urgent as he speaks to her) Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.  She is bewildered by the change.   Why, Jessica? You're still a green.  JESSICA shakes her head. She doesn't know why.  Logan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand, moved. But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment. He wheels, pulling her with him.   Come on then--they'll be here any minute!  Uncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSION shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen, led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come.  Panic. Turmoil. PEOPLE running, SCREAMING--the ALARM BELL RINGING, RINGING as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage of the room.    As the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. They watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The Sandman is smashed away, burning.    Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his crystal can be seen from the room.    As he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads her off down the tunnel.    following the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but always down.    Hearing a SOUND they turn and see:    As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain.   Wait - I have the one I took from the Runner.  SOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the Runner's ankh.  Logan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again...and the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel.  As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again another TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything.  In the distance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching.  As the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankh into the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lighted center becomes brighter as the door opens.  There is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back... realizes what he has done and is shaken.  As the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER:    Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light. Finally, Logan gestures ''this way\" and sets out.  (NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible, sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the great wall...    A. Making their way along the walkway side by side.  B. Stopping as the walkway disappears under water. Logan wading in while she waits -- until he re-emerges. She follows.  C. Choosing between diverging ramps. Having to return.   It's the only way.  D. POV an alley way full of machinery. Logan gives a wheel a half turn -- great rusty net-combs start to winnow the water.  E. Helping Jessica, Logan slips...falls into darkness. Jessica's fear until he emerges, hand over slimy hand. The water is cold.  F. POV ancient signs - PROTOPLANK...DEPOT NO #11 DO NOT DECANT...  Some kind of breeding pens...I suppose...They say people used to breed animal s, fish, anything  To eat, of course.   Stay here, while I see what it is.  Jessica nods, frightened. Logan slips off into the darkness. In a moment he's back. His face - is grim.    Trying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must go back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly seeming small and distant.  As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall, suddenly:    Logan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion, somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancient machinery GROANS.  They turn and run as they HEAR:  FRANCIS (distorted; echo; etcetera     Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and pushes a half-drowning Jessica through.    Moving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside - flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow. It is now very cold.  In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly, tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to move.   It's brighter there...besides, we can't go back.  He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back.   It doesn't make any difference anymore.   You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?   I had to. I did kill...for the first time in my life I killed.   I guess so...I know I felt something I never felt before...and I didn't like it...not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.   All right - what are you?   We're hungrydo you have anything to eat?   This place is a link to Sanctuary, isn't it?  Box looks totally confused.   How do you think we got here??!!   We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?  Box looks around the cavern:   Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!  We hear a NOISE outside.   You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.   Where do you send them?   Answer the question!   There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's--  BOX (interrupting; his voice tone changing; very lucid Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.   That's better.  How do you want us?   How do you want us?    ...oblivious to Box...their feelings intensifying as they continue to hold one another.    Before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and passionately.  Their mood is broken by:    There are tears in Jessica's eyes as she reacts to the sculpture.  JESSICA (squeezing Logan's hand) It's glorious  Logan helps Jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress.   All right. Now you keep your bargain.  BOX (rapt by his work) Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!  LOGAN (only interested in getting out We're ready.  Box mumbles as he leads Logan and Jessica toward the rear of the Ice Cavern.    Horrified as they move slowly along the wall.   How did they get in here?   What other food?   Tell us how to get out...or IÂ¹ll destroy you..I'll kill you!  Box laughs...The same LOUD, ROARING LAUGH we HEARD earlier.  Then:    Retreating...as Logan FIRES again and again...to no avail.  As Logan and Jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of this room and:    Finally reaching the rear wall of this room as:    Seemingly pinned back against the rear wall.  Logan is FIRING his gun futilely with his right hand...while moving his empty hand against the rear wall...trying to find a knob or button which might open it.  The entire time he never takes his eyes off:    Against the rear wall...We can SEE...but they cannot...that above them...on the ceiling...there are a number of exposed cables.    Box is practically upon them.  As he lunges forward with his WHIRRING saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down alongside her.  Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice out of the rear wall as:  Logan SHOOTS at Box from the floor Level...upwards ...trying to penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body. He misses but hits the exposed cables on the ceiling.  There is an EXPLOSION.  BOX (looking up; screaming) No! The coils!  Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern containing his sculptures.      Stir in the dimness, amazed to be alive.  SOUND: A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into the water.  As it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again. They look and see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by the last ice fall. Water rains across the opening.  Logan and Jessica make their way to it, step out.   It seems to be moving away. Come on...    clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge.   It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.   Jessica -- we must be outside!  She looks at him, uncertainly, he puts an arm around her and they set out again.    They come upon bushes of berries. Logan picks a few, looks at them and smells them. As he is about to put them in his mouth...Jesslca grabs hold of his hand.   Sooner or later, we'll have to try something  Logan eats the berries...as Jessica watches intently.  After a beat   They're good.  Logan and Jessica pick berries and eat. When they are finished:   Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.  They sit on the ground.    Sitting on the ground.  Jessica is shivering. Logan has his arms around her trying to keep her warm.   I doubt it.  I won't.  After a long beat:   It all seemed to make sense until Box.   How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.  At her stricken look...Logan touches her in a caring way.   You're right...it must be near now. We'll find it.  JESSICA (yawning; closing her eyes; resting on his shoulder) Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?    walking in the hot sun...grimy...thirsty.    Seeing shimmering in the distance. They walk toward it.    Reaching...   You know, Jessica.   Of course.    Coming out of the forest...climbing up a green hilly area...reaching the top and seeing:    Walking toward CAMERA to edge of swamp they stop and look at:    Exiting CAMERA RIGHT toward Memorial    Climbing steps of memorial toward statue.    Looking up at statue.    Looking up at statue.   I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.         As they pass the stones, Logan glances at them.   They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?    Walking up the steps...many of which are cracked.  They are proceeding with great caution...as they enter the Capitol Building.    SOUND: HAMMERING NOISE -- irregular. It stops after a bit.  They walk to the door and open it cautiously.  They EXIT right.    React, then they enter Senate and stop and look.    It could be...  There are a COUPLE OF CATS on the man's lap as he turns and faces Logan and Jessica...when he HEARS them move closer.  The man is stroking the cats calmly...unperturbed by the appearance of Logan and Jessica.   How old are you?   Your hair is white.   Is that what they're called-- cats?   How long have you been living here?   What kind of place is this?   How did you get here?   Are there any other humans?   Have any other people ever passed through?  The man shakes his head...then:   What makes you think so?   Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?  The man nods.   Where are they?     No--I'm sorry. It's not possible.   I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.  As the man continues to look petulant:  JESSICA (simply; sincerely That's the truth.  Jessica takes off a ring and hands it to the man.   What's beyond this place - do you know?   Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?   May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.    Logan clears two chairs of cats and they sit down.  Jessica picks up a book and starts leafing through it.  Logan is deep in thought.  Jessica looks up from the book.   That sweet madman -- how could he Come to exist?   One in a million, I suppose  LOGAN AND JESSICA (together; smiling) ...Who knows?    There's nothing to go on to, Jessica.  Logan continues to shake his head through Jessica's following line:   You want there to be one...that Doesn't...  JESSICA (interrupting; urgent tone) There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!   No, there doesn't. Not really --just so many want it to exist...so many who don't want to die...want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes \"real\". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.  JESSICA (becoming hysterical You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!  As Logan takes her in his arms...comforting her:   That's the same fellow who's outside. If he was so important - why isn't he first?  The old man shakes his head.    Holding up his right palm.   Look at your palm, Francis.... look! It's clear. Clear!   I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that....  FRANCIS (interrupting; wild) Why did you do that???!!!  Francis leaps from the gallery and falls on Logan.    In hand to hand combat punching...Kicking...wrestling    Rubbing his face with the palms of his hands...clearly upset.   Not yet.   What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?   We can't. We're going back.   I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and--   Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!   Things change!   Jessica...listen to me...listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that...I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?   I know...I know...  The Old Man comes to them, wondering.   We're leaving.   To a city with thousands and thousands of people.   More...many more.   I promise. We '11 go on as soon as it's light.  JESSICA (gently, turning O.M. away) But now I'm tired. Let's go back to the fire...  They turn, the Old Man still marveling at the sight.   Thank you.  Tell me - what do those words mean? \"Beloved husbandÂ²...Â²Beloved son\"... \"Beloved wife\"'...   Stay? They lived together all their years?   Yes. You and I, Jessica.    Sanctuary is the right to live.... nothing more. But nothing less, either....  There is a long beat...then Jessica snuggles up to Logan...she is ready for sleep.   Beloved wife...     As they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the distance.  The Old Man marvels at what he sees...they walk on.    Walking up the beach toward the domed city. We get an idea of the scale. They appear as ants in front of redwood trees.    Approaching. The wave power inlet in f.g. They   It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.   Of course.  I don't know where...  I Just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.  The CAMERA PANS LOGAN, JESSICA and the OLD MAN down the STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION until they reach:   I know... (after a beat; to the Old Man We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.   I'm sorry.   Can you make it back?    Emerging from the water.  It is a labyrinth of humming turbines, automonitored cables and impulse collectors.  Logan leads her swiftly through the humming maze toward an exit.  369- 369Xl OUT   No!! Don't go in there !!  The CROWD turns and looks up at:    On a high balcony in the Great Hall.  Looking down at them.   You don't have to die!! No one has to die at thirty!!! You don't have to blink out on Lastday. There's no renewal on Carrousel! You can live longer and grow old... I've seen it. She's seen it!! Believe me!!  There is an angry murmur in the CROWD as Logan continues:  LOGAN (holding up his palm See... it's' clear. The Lifeclocks are a lie - Carousel is a lie!!    A shaft of light glows on and he stiffens - bound by it.    As around him in the air, a series of spectral greenish HEADS appear -- one after the other -in response to questions. Each of these heads is Logan. Each revolves slowly on its axis as it responds.  As the real Logan  is questioned, each of the heads answers in turn. They are each a part of his persona and his brain.       Straining twisting, as the light above him bursts, goes out in a puff of smoke -- releasing him. Logan staggers to his feet in time to meet:    Manages to get one of the Sandmen's guns, instantly blasting him with it. In the noise and confusion, the fight becomes general. A Sandman fires back at Logan, misses -- the shot hits one of the Lifeclocks which flares electrically, ribboning out a great arc. Instantly Logan gets off a couple of shots at the other Lifeclocks which similarly flare and burst into violent electrical fire and discharges.    Making their way through Cathedral -- out the dazzle chamber, running O.S. past Maze Car Station.    Running past Power Center."

    "description": "It's 2274, and on the surface, it all seems to be an idyllic society. Living in a city within an enclosed dome, there is little or no work for humans to perform, and inhabitants are free to pursue all of the pleasures of life. There is one catch however: your life is limited and when you reach thirty, it is terminated in a quasi-religious ceremony known as \"carrousel\". Some, known as \"runners\", try to escape their fate when the time comes, and it's the job of Sandmen to track them down and kill them. Logan (Michael York) is such a man, and with several years before his own termination date, thinks nothing of the job he does. Soon after meeting a young woman, Jessica-6 (Jenny Agutter), he is ordered to become a runner and infiltrate a community outside the dome known as \"Sanctuary\" and to destroy it. Pursued by his friend Francis (Richard Jordan), also a Sandman, Logan and Jessica find their way to the outside. There, they discover a beautiful, virtually uninhabited world. Logan realizes that he must return to the dome to tell them what he's found and be set free.âgarykmcd",
