        "Hall": "written by          Woody Allen    Marshall Brickman      It's a nice ham this year, Mom.  Grammy Hall takes a sip of her wine and nods.    A great sauce.    We went over to the swap meet.  Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.   (Lighting a cigarette and turning to Alvy) Ann tells us that you've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.   Duane and I went out to the boat basin.   Yeah.  Randolph Hunt was drunk, as usual.   Oh, that Randolph Hunt.  You remember Randy Hunt, Annie.  He was in the choir with you.   Stupid Thelma Poindexter ... to the Veterans Hospital.   My God, he's the new president of the El Regis.  Let me tell you, the man is somethin' else.   That's Jack's wife.  We used to make that outta raisins.   Oh, you remember her, Annie.   How do you plan to spend the holidays, Mrs. Singer?   Fast?   What sins?  I don't understand.    Mom and Dad Hall walk into the living room; Annie is with them.   Now, don't let it be so long, now.   And look up Uncle Bill, you promise.   Oh, he's adorable, Annie.   We're going to take them to the airport.   Oh, no-Duane can.  I haven't finished my drink.   M'mmm.    Annie, looking slightly distraught, goes to open the door to Alvy's knock.    An actor and actress sit on hard wooden chairs in a sparse rehearsal ball. They face each other.  The actress resembles Annie; the actor, Alvy.",
        "Annie": "written by          Woody Allen    Marshall Brickman      Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?  Annie closes the cab door and she and Alvy move over to the ticket booth of the theater as they continue to talk.   You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.   Okay. (They move into the ticket line, still talking.  A billboard next to them reads \"INGMAR BERGMAN'S 'FACE  I'm not getting my period.  Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!  They move over to the ticket counter, people in front of them buying tickets and walking off screen.   Two minutes, Alvy.   In the middle? (Alvy nods his head yes and let's out an exasperated sigh) We'll only miss the titles.  They're in Swedish.   Two hours?  No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.  She moves past the ticket clerk.   Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?   Alright.  All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?   Oh, come on, we've seen it.  I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.    H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.    Well, stop listening to him.   I missed my therapy.  I overslept.   The alarm clock.   I know-because of our sexual problem, right?   Stop it, Alvy!   And you know something else?  You know, you're so egocentric that if I miss my therapy you can think of it in terms of how it affects you!   Oh!   Okay, I'm very sorry.  My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem!  Huh?  The man in front of them turns to look at them, then looks away.   M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.   That movie makes me feel guilty.   Alvy, I ...   I-you know, I don't wanna.   I know, well, it's just that-you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.    I know.  Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.   I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get.  You were very hot for Allison at first.   Alvy, now don't panic.  Please.   Stop it!  Don't ... don't do that!  There. The lobsters continue to crawl on the floor.  Annie, bolding out a wooden paddle, tries to shove them onto it.   Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.   Oh, all right.  All right!  It's all right.  Here.  She drops the paddle and picks up one of the lobsters by the tail.  Laughing, she shoves it at Alvy who jerks backward, squeamishly.    Oooh!  Here!  Here!    Get him!    I can't!  I can't put him in the pot.  I can't put a live thing in hot water.    Oh, God!  Here yuh go!  Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah!  Okay.   All right.  All right.  All right.  She moves hurriedly across the kitchen and picks up another lobster.  Smiling, she places it on the counter as Alvy stands beside the refrigerator trying to push it from the wall.    Yeah.  I'm gonna get my ... I'm gonna get my camera.   Great!  Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh!  These are ... p-p-p-pick this lobster up.  Hold it, please!   It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful ... Ooooh, lovely!   Don't be a jerk.  One more, Alvy, please, one more picture. (Reluctantly Alvy picks up the lobster again as Annie takes another picture) Oh, oh, good, good!   Oh ... no, no, no, no, uh, uh.  No.   Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.   Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.   Then there was Jerry, the actor.   I look pretty.    Oh, right.  Right, yeah, I think I know exactly what you mean, when you say \"religious.\"    Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.   No, how?   Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat-looking and he was emotional ... Y-hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.  Jerry stops rubbing the younger Annie's arm and slides down to the floor as she raises her foot toward his chest.   He was creepy.    Oh, really?  Well, la-de-da!   Oh, that's right.  That you really like those New York girls.   Oh, I'd say so.  You married-    -two of them.    I know, but ooh- here he comes.  Okay.  Rob and Alvy enter the court and walk over to the two women.  Rob kisses Janet and makes introduction.    How are yuh?   Hi.  Annie and Alvy shake hands.    Well ... so ... I can't play too good, you know.   Hi.  Hi, hi.   (Hands clasped in front of her, smiling) Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.   Oh, yeah?  So do you.  Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right?  I mean, you say it, \"You play well,\" and right away ... I have to say well.  Oh, oh ... God, Annie.  Well ... oh, well ... la-de-da, la-de-da, la-la.  She turns around and moves toward the door.   (Turning and aiming her thumb over her shoulder) Oh, why-uh ... y-y-you gotta car?    Oh, no, I have a car.   I don't ...  I don't ... Geez, I don't know, I've ... I wa- This ... yeah, I got this VW out there ... (Laughing and gesturing toward the door) What a jerk, yeah.  Would you like a lift?   Me?  Oh, downtown!    Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.   Yeah, well, I'm, but I ...  Alvy picks up his bag and moves toward the door. As he turns his bag around, the handle of the tennis racket bits Annie between the legs.    I mean, I can go uptown, too.  I live uptown, but ... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.    Oh, I'm in her acting class.   Well, I do commercials, sort of ...  She zooms down the wrong lane, cars swerving out of her way.  A horn blows.   No, Chippewa Falls.   Wisconsin.   Uh, don't worry, I'm a very- (A car moves closer to the VW, almost on top of it in the wrong direction.  Annie swerves away at the very last minute -a very good driver. (Alvy rubs his head nervously, staring out the window as Annie speeds along) So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?  Annie looks down beside her, searching for the gum.   Well, where is it?  I-   Okay.  They both fumble around in her pocketbook.  Alvy looks up to see the entire front of a truck in Annie's windshield.  She swerves just in time.   Okay, that's good.  Alvy continues to look for the gum while Annie zooms down the city streets.   All right.   Yeah ... so, listen-you drive?   Oh, you do?   Oh, right.    Huh?   Huh?  Oh, yeah.   I live over here.  Oh, my God!  Look! There's a parking space!  With brakes squealing, Annie turns the VW sharply into the parking spot. Annie and Alvy get out, Alvy looking over his shoulder as he leaves the car.   Don't be funny.   Huh?  Oh ... yeah.    Yeah, thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Well...    Oh.  Alvy shakes hands with Annie.    Yeah.   Oh, you do?  Yeah?  Oh, well, it's uh ... this is, uh ... this tie is a present, from Grammy Hall.  Annie flips the bottom of the tie.    Yeah, my grammy.    Yeah, I know.   I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?    Well ...   Oh, yeah, yeah.    Hey, well, listen ... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh ... and have a glass of wine and something?  Aw, no, I mean ... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...   You sure?   Okay.   Oh, you see an analyst?   Fifteen years?   Fifteen-aw, come on, you're . . . yeah, really?    Alvy, standing, looks around the apartment.  There are lots of books, framed photographs on the white wall.  A terrace can be seen from the window.  He picks up a copy of Ariet, by Sylvia Platb, as Annie comes out of the kitchen carrying two glasses.  She hands them to Alvy.   M'hm...   Oh, yeah.   Right.  Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.   Neat, yeah.    Oh ... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my ... brother, Duane.    Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.   Sadie?  Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George.  Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it?  Uh ...   Narcolepsy, right, right.  Right.  So, anyway, so ...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was ... (Annie points her fingers to each side of her head, indicating George was a little crazy) shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War. (Laughing hysterically, she opens a cabinet door and takes out a bottle of wine) Anyway, so, so ...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec ...uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead.  Yeah.  Oh, dear.  Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say?  I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.  Annie unscrews the bottle of wine, silent now after her speech.    Oh, really?  Oh, well ... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh ...   Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.   Well, didn't you take, uh ... uh, a shower at the club?    Why not?    Oh, I see, I see.   Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I see.  I guess-    Fifteen years, huh?   Yeah.  Oh, God bless!  Theyput their glasses together in a toast.    Well, uh ...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.    Yeah, well ... you-She hates Jews.  She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever.  I'm tellin' yuh.    Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.  Annie's thoughts pop on the screen as she talks: I dabble?  Listen to me-what a jerk!   Well, I-I-I would-I would like to take a serious photography course soon.  Again, Annie's thoughts pop on: He probably thinks I'm a yo-yo   Aesthetic criteria?  You mean, whether it's, uh, good photo or not?  I'm not smart enough for him.  Hang in there   Well, well, I ... to me-I ... I mean, it's-it's-it's all instinctive, you know.  I mean, I just try to uh, feel it, you know?  I try to get a sense of it and not think about it so much.  God, I hope he doesn't turn out to be a shmuck like the others   Well, I don't know.  I mean, I guess-I guess you must be sorta late, huh?   Me?  Oh, uh.  No.    Oh ... nothing.  Not-no, no!    I know.   Well, I mean, I meet a lot of ... jerks, you know-    -what I mean?    But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they ... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot!  No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing.  Yeah.    Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club.  I don't-    -it's my first time.    Yeah.   I was awful.  I'm so ashamed!  I can't sing.   Whatta you mean, a tad restless?  Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.   No, I'm gonna quit!   Really, do you think so, really?   Yeah?    Yeah, you know something?  I never even took a lesson, either.  They stop in the middle of the sidewalk.  Alvy turns Annie around to face him.   What?  Really?  Yeah.   Oh, all right.  Okay.  Yeah.  They kiss.   We can digest our-    Yeah ... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce. (Alvy involuntarily makes a face as the waiter leaves) Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?   Oh.  And your first wife was Allison?   Oh.   M'm, that was so nice.  That was nice.   H'm?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah?  No. (She turns and looks at Alvy, then laughs) You're a wreck.      No.    Here, you want some?   Yeah?  Oh, I don't know, I don't really.  I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er ... relaxes me at first.   What?  What?  H'm?  (Looking at the books Alvy    Yeah?  They move over to the cashier line.   M'hm.  M'hm.   M'hm.  Yeah.   M'hm.  U-huh.  M'hm.    Yeah.  Oh! Italian, right?    Oh, yeah?   You see, like you and I ...   No, I'm not.   Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.   Ooooh!  They stop walking.  Holding Annie's arms, Alvy turns her to face him.  The South Street Bridge, lit up for the night, is in the background.   Come on.  Yeah.  You know what?  You know, I like you, I really mean it.  I really do like you.   Do I love you?   Yeah.   Well, I certainly ... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah ...  yeah.  Do you love me?   Yeah.  Yeah.  I dunno.   Of course.   Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.   I have a tiny apartment.   (Picking up the suitcases and walking into the bedroom) That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.   You don't want me to live with you?   Mine.   I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh?     How is it any different?    That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.   Yes, it is.    You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.   Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?    Does this sound like a good course? Uh, \"Modern American Poetry\"?  Uh, or, uh-let's see now ... maybe I should, uh, take \"Introduction to the Novel.\"   What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think?  Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?  Alvy leans over and kisses her shoulder.    Well, okay.  Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?    Well, have you ever made love high?   (Moving back into the room and lighting a joint) It relaxes me.    Well, what's the difference, anyway?   Oh, come on, look who's talking.  You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. (She gets into bed and takes a puff of marijuana) You should smoke some o' this.  You'd be off the couch in no time.   What are you doing?   Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.    Uh-uh-why?   No, I'm fine.  As Annie speaks, her inner self  sits down on a chair, watching.   U-huh.   Let's just do it, all right?   Alvy, do you remember where I put my drawing pad?  Because while you two are doing that, I think I'm gonna do some drawing.   Oh, you have my body.    Well, I need grass and so do you.    M'hm.   Were you always funny?   Alvy, you were ... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding.  It was- You were so neat.   Yeah.  Yeah.  And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.   Yeah.    Oh.   Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow.  I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.  They start moving toward the exit, a girl snapping a picture of Alvy with a flash camera as they walk through the crowd.   No, I don't think so.  No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all.  On the contrary, I think-   It's Easter.  You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat.  I think they're gonna really like you.    The camera shows a neat two-story house surrounded by a well-manicured green lawn, then cuts to:    Oh, yeah.  Grammy always does such a good job.   We really had a good time.  Grammy continues to stare at Alvy; he is now dressed in the long black coat and hat of the Orthodox Jew, complete with mustache and heard.   Oh, yes, yes.  Alvy, leaning his elbow on the table, looks out toward the camera.   Oh, yes, that's right.  Did you see the new play?   Yes, I do.  The two families start talking back and forth to one another.  The screen is still split.   No.   Okay.  Okay.   You think so?  Do you really?   Yes, Duane is.  I'll be right-   I just have time to get the, uh-  She walks out of the room as Mom and Dad Hall kiss.    You followed me.  I can't believe it!   You followed me!   Well, what is your definition of following?   Do you realize how paranoid you are?   That is the worst kind of paranoia.   Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.   \"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature\"! You're really close.    Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!  She walks away.    We're not having an affair.  He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.   Who cares?  Who cares?   You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!   It's his name.    Alvy!  Alvy!  You're the one who never wanted to make a real commitment.  You don't think I'm smart enough!  We had that argument just last month, or don't ou remember that day?    I'm home!   (Comes into the kitchen and puts down a bag of groceries on the kitchen table) Oh, it was ...  really weird.  But she's a very nice woman.   And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up.  So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.   And then she mentioned penis envy ... Did you know about that?   M'hm.   Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.   And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.   M'hm.   Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.    Yeah.   In-in ... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.   Yeah, and he's strangling me ...   ... and I keep, you know, it's-    She said, your name was Alvy Singer.   Yeah, yeah, yeah, you.  Because in the dream ... I break Sinatra's glasses.    Oh, and God, Alvy, I did ... this really terrible thing to him.  Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.    Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week.  And you know something?  I don't think I mind analysis at all.  The only question is, Will it change my wife?   Will it change my life?   No, I didn't.  I said, \"Will it change my life,\" Alvy.    Life.  I said, \"life.\"  Alvy turns toward the camera.   And, Alvy ... and then I told her about  A bit rapidly.  I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!   And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?   I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!  Annie gets into the cab; Alvy leans over and closes the door.    Annie, looking slightly distraught, goes to open the door to Alvy's knock.     There's a spider in the bathroom.  There's a big black spider in the bathroom.   My God, I mean, you know how I am about   -I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.      I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.   Yeah.  It was just great!  I called you; you wanna help me ... or  (Turning to a nearby chair for    (Sitting down on a chair arm    It really is lovely.  It's in the bathroom.   Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.     Yeah?  Two?  Oh, I-I left it at your house.     Well, what are you doing ... what are  Well, okay.  Oooh.          Was there somebody in your room when  I mean was there another- I thought I  Yeah?   Yeah.  Alvy pulls her to him and they kiss again.   Alvy, let's never break up again.  I don't  Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?   You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and ... Yeah.   Alvy, what about ... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-   Okay, okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  -me, my God, it's a great day!      Well, I had a really good day, you know  Yeah, but it's real close.       What is this? Is this a...Present?  Are you kidding?   Uh, yeah, uh ... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-       Oh, yeah?  What is this, anyway?  Let me see.  Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this ...  God, it's terrific, God!        Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be ... huh?  Tony, a famous record personality, pushes through the crowd, moving toward Alvy and Annie.  An entourage follows him as he makes his way to their table.   Oh.  Well, hi!   Oh, yeah, really, oh!   Oh, neat ... oh, that's very nice,    Oh.  What about?    Well, hey, that's, that's nice.  Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy?  Uh ... and ... uh ... Tony Lacey.   Hi.    Yeah.   What thing?   Thing?    Oh, the thing!  Oh, the thing ...  ... yeah ... yeah.  Annie turns, looks at Tony as he smiles and gestures with his hands.   Hey-   Oh.   Oh, gosh.   Nice to see you ... bye.  Yeah.  Bye.  She turns and looks at Alvy.   (Looking down at her hands, then up at Alvy) I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.   All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?     Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.   Do you have sex often?   Constantly!  I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.   And ... I don't know ... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it.  I woulda done it, just to please him.   But the thing is-I mean, since our  I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him.  But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings.  I don't know I-I can't win.    Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.   Well, I always wanted to try, you know, but, uh, Alvy, uh ... he's very down on it.   You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.    That's sick!   Yeah.  Come on.  It'd be fun.   Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?   Oh, do you know something-I didn't tell yuh, we're going to California next week.   Yeah ...    No, no, no that's not it at all.  Alvy's giving an award on television.  Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.   God.     God, it's so clean out here.   You know, it was snowing-it was snowing and really gray in New York yesterday.    Yes.   (On the phone, overlapping the doctor and Alvy) Well ... H-h huh ... Oh, good ... Yes, I'll tell him.    Excuse me.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show.  They said everything is fine.  They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.   Yeah.  Listen, Doctor, I'm worried.  Nothing at all?   What do you mean?  Do you think he's-   Uh-huh ... Oh, hospital?   I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.   Oh.    Oh yeah, stay here?  U-huh.    I don't know.  I don't know.  She picks up an hors doeuvre.   Yeah.    Yeah.   Yeah.   Boy, this is really a nice screening room.  It's really a nice room.   Yeah.   Yeah.    Oh, yeah?   Oh, good.  Okay.   It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.   Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?    That was fun.  I don't think California is bad at all.  It's a drag coming home.    I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.   If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.    Alvy, uh, let's face it.  You know something, don't think our relationship is working.   (Walking into the room with an armload of books) Well, let's see now ... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.   (Putting down the books and flipping back her hair) Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.   (Holding a framed picture and moving about) Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.   Oh-   -God.   Right.  Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back.  M'mmm.    Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.  She walks away.    Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.   (Walking in with another armload of books) Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?   What?    Exactly, but ... exactly.  Ooooh!    Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-   I guess these are all yours.  Impeach, uh, Eisenhower ... Impeach Nixon ... Impeach Lyndon Johnson ... Impeach Ronald Reagan.   Hi.  Alvy wipes at his nose as he stares.  He smiles, the street traffic moving behind him. Annie smiles back.   Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all. (Alvy adjusts his glasses, not exactly knowing where to start;  a bit uneasy) Well, you look nice.    Oh, Alvy, come on.    Well, whatta you mean?  I mean, it's perfectly fine out here.  I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and-and we play tennis. I mean, that's ... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean ... (Reacting, Alvy looks down at his hands, then up) I'm able to enjoy people more.    What's so great about New York?  I mean, it's a dying city.  You read \"Death in Venice.\"   That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word \"death\" in the titles.   Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that?  I mean, your life is New York City.  You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.    No. We're friends.  I wanna remain friends.    You're mad, aren't you?   Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life.  I really just can't say that that's true.  I mean, you know how wonderful you are.  I mean, you know ... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and-and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap.  Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?    No!  Look, I gotta go.  She starts to rise.   I'm late.   If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony.  The Grammys are tonight.   The Grammys.  He's got a lotta records up for awards.   Oh!  Just forget it, Alvy, okay?  Let's just forget the conversation.  She closes the door, starts the motor.",
        "Allison": "Ma'am, you're on right after this man ... about twenty minutes, something like that.    Who are you?   Oh, comedian.  Yes.  Oh, uh ... you're on next.    Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.   Yes.   Why not?   It's okay.    Will you relax, please?  They're gonna love you, I know.    Yes.    Do you feel all right?  As Allison and Alvy look out at the stage, the camera cuts to their point of view: a comedian standing at a podium in front of huge waving pictures of Adlai Stevenson.  The audience, laughing and clapping, sits at round tables in clusters around the room.  The camera moves back to Allison and Alvy watching the stage.  Alvy is swinging his hands nervously.    Allison.    Portchnik.   Well, I'm getting tired of it.  I need your attention.  Alvy gets up from the bed and starts walking restlessly around the room, gesturing with his hands.   Alvy.  Alvy, stopping for a moment at the fireplace mantel, sighs.  He then snaps his fingers and starts walking again.   We've been through this.   (Moving back to the bed and lighting a cigarette) Okay.  All right, so whatta yuh saying, now?  That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?   Yeah, Earl Warren?   Lyndon Johnson?   Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?   The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?  Alvy touches Allison's shoulder, then gets up from the bed and starts walking again.   You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.",
        "Rob": "You're crazy!   Alvy, you're a total paranoid.   Ah, Max, you, uh ...   Why, Max?  It's a good name for you.  Max, you see conspiracies in everything.   Right, Max.  California, Max.   Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.   -we move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.    Right, Max, forget it.  Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?   There's Henry Drucker.  He has a chair in history at Princeton.  Oh, the short man is Hershel Kaminsky.  He has a chair in philosophy at Cornell.   Why are you so hostile?    Is that Paul Goodman?  No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book.  Hi, Doug!  Douglas Wyatt. \"A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of-the-Heart.\"  They move through the rooms, Robin holding a drink in one hand, her arm draped in Alvy's; the crowd mills around them.   Commentary.   No jokes-these are friends, okay?   Here you are.  There's people out there.   Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?   Stop acting out.  She sits on the edge of the bed, looking down at the sprawled-out Alvy.   Alvy, don't!  You're using sex to express hostility.    There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine.  My God!  What would they think?  She gets up and fixes the zipper on her dress.  She turns and moves toward the door.   Oh, I'm sorry!   Dammit!  I was so close.  She flips on the overhead lamp and turns on her side.  Alvy turns to her.   (Reaching over for her eyeglasses on the night table) I'm too tense.  I need a Valium.  My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.    Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense.  Where's the goddamn Valium?  She fumbles about the floor for the Valium, then back on the bed.   I can't.   My head is throbbing.   I have a headache.   Oswald and ghosts.   Where are you going?   Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to  Max, the city is terribly worried.   No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out.  Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.   Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.   You know Alvy?    You know Annie?    Who's playing who here?  Alvy Well, uh ... you and me against them?   Max, will you forget about Annie?  I know lots of women you can date.   Max, have I got a girl for you.  You are going to love her.  She's a reporter-  The cartoon figures of Alvy and Rob walk past the Wicked Queen; the screen dissolves into the interior of a concert ball.  Rob's voice carries over from the cartoon scene as the screen shows Alvy with the female reporter.  It's very crowded, noisy; policeman and reporters are everywhere. Alvy stands with his hands in his pockets, watching the commotion.   -for Rolling Stone.     I can't wait to see the old neighborhood.  We can show her the schoolyard.  Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard.  They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.   You're lucky, Max-where I used to live  What kind of good memories, Max?  They can't hear you, Max.   Hey, Max!  Who's that?  As the three friends watch Alvy's old living room, the scene has suddenly shifted.  A huge crowd stands around the room, laughing, eating, chatting and vibrating with the turns of the roller-coaster ride.   Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.   Uh, how did this personality come about?  There were many men interested in you?     I've never been so relaxed as I have been since I moved out here, Max.  I want you to see my house.  I live right next to Hugh Hefner's house, Max. He lets me use the Jacuzzi.  And the women, Max, they're like the women in Playboy magazine, only they can move their arms and legs.   Aw, come on, Max, give us a break, will yuh?  It's Christmas.  Annie starts snapping pictures of the view.   No kidding?   Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.   While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show.  And we're invited to a big Christmas party.  They continue driving, now in a less residential area, passing a hot-dog stand. \"Tail-Pup\" concession; people mill about eating hot dogs.   Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.   A limousine to the track breakdown?     Max, I've got a hit series.  Arnie.    Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.    We do the show live in front of an audience.   Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.   You better lie down.  You've been in the sun too long.    Yeah ... uh, now give me a like a medium-size chuckle here ... and then a big hand.  The sounds of laughter and applause are heard from the TV.   What's the matter?   Well, sit down.   You all right?   (Crouching before Alvy, looking at him) You wanna lie down?   How about a ginger ale?   You like this house, Max?   I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.   What difference does that make?  Alvy looks into the room, where Annie and Tony Lacey are having an animated conversation.   Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max.  He goes with that girl over there.   The one with the V.P.L.   Visible panty line.  Max, she is gorgeous.   There are no twos, Max.   M'hm.    How do you like this couple, Max?  A couple moves over toward Rob and Alvy.  The man's arm is around the woman; they stand very close.  In the background, Annie and Tony are still talking.   And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.   If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.   Oh, he-he didn't say anything.    Hi.  How do you do.   Yeah.  Right.   We're gonna operate together.  Rob and the girl walk of together as the camera moves in on Tony and Annie standing by the buffet table.   Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.    Twins, Max.  Sixteen-year-olds.  Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?   Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged.  I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.  He puts on an elaborate helmet and goggles.   Keeps out the alpha rays, Max.  You don't get old.",

        "Alvy's": "My analyst says I exaggerate my childhood memories, but I swear I was brought up underneath the roller-   -coaster in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn.  Maybe that accounts for my personality, which is a little nervous, I think.   You know, I have a hyperactive imagination. My mind tends to jump around a little, and have some trouble between fantasy and reality.   My father ran the bumper-car concession. (Alvy as a child moves into the frame driving a bumper car.  He stops as other cars bombard him.  His father continues to direct the traffic) There-there he is and there I am.  But I-I-I-I used to get my aggression out through those cars all the time.  Alvy backs up his car off screen.   I remember the staff at our public school.  You know, we had a saying, uh, that \"Those who can't do, teach, and those who can't teach, teach gym.\" And ...uh, h'h, of course, those who couldn't do anything, I think, were assigned to our school.  I must say-   I always felt my schoolmates were idiots. Melvyn Greenglass, you know, fat little face, and Henrietta Farrell, just Miss Perfect all the time.  And-and Ivan Ackerman, always the wrong answer.  Always.  Ivan stands up behind his desk.   Even then I knew they were just jerks. (The camera moves back to the teacher, who is glaring out at her students) In nineteen forty-two I had already dis-  As Alvy talks, the camera shows him move from his seat and kiss a young girl. She jumps from her seat in disgust, rubbing her cheek, as Alvy moves back to his seat.   Right.  Sometimes I wonder where my classmates are today.  The camera shows the full classroom, the students sitting behind their desks, the teacher standing in the front of the room.  One at a time, the young students rise u from their desks and speak.    Dennis-right, uh, uh ... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.    Oh, I can imagine.  P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.    Look at you, you-you,-re such a clown.   Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you ...   Heavy!  Eaten by some squirrels.   I-I may throw up!    Alvy, somewhat distraught, is following Annie around his apartment, which is filled with boxes and suitcases, clothes and framed pictures.  They both carry cartons.    Jesus, this guy's pathetic.   (To himself while the comic continues his routine) Look at him mincing around, like he thinks he's real cute.  You wanna throw up.  If only I had the nerve to do my own jokes.  I don't know how much longer I can keep this smile frozen on my face. I'm in the wrong business, I know it.   Let 'im drop dead!  Who needs his business?!   His wife has diabetes!   Di-diabetes?  Is that any excuse? Diabetes?   The man is fifty years old and doesn't have a substantial job.   (Putting more meat on her husband's plate) Is that a reason to steal from his father?   Whatta you talkin' about?  You don't know what you're talking about.   Yes, I know what I'm talking about.    George, defend him!    No Moskowitz he had a coronary.   You don't say.   We fast.   Yeah, no food.  You know, we have to atone for our sins.   Tell you the truth, neither do we.   You know, even as a kid I always went for the wrong women.  I think that's my problem.  When my mother took me to see Snow White, everyone fell in love with Snow White.  I immediately fell for the Wicked Queen.  The scene dissolves into a sequence from the animated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  The Wicked Queen, resembling Annie, sits in the palace before her mirror.  Alvy, as a cartoon figure, sits beside her, arms crossed in front of him.    The reporter is sitting up in bed, lighted cigarette in her hand.  Alvy, lying next to her, rubs his eyes and puts on his eyeglasses.    Alvy is lying in bed next to Annie, who is leaning on her elbow looking down at him.  He rubs her arms and she smiles.    Alvy's father sits in his chair.  His mother is polishing a door while Alvy lies on the floor playing.  Annie, adult Alvy and Rob quietly walk into the scene to watch.   You fired the cleaning woman?   She was stealing.   But she's colored.    So the colored have enough trouble.   She was going through my pocketbook!   They're persecuted enough!   Who's persecuting?  She stole!  Alvy's father gets up and gets his hard hat.  He sits back down and starts polishing it.   All right-so we can afford it.  How can we afford it?  On your pay?  She's a colored woman, from Harlem!  Leo ... I married a fool!  I was always the sister with good common    How often do you sleep together?   Lotta beautiful women.  It was fun to flirt.   (An open magazine lies in his lap) I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight.  Whatta I need this?   If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out.  It'd probably wreck her.  But I should be honest.  He looks over at Annie.    A lighted Christmas tree stands in the middle of boxes, books, and the general disarray of packing and figuring out what belongs to whom as Alvy helps Annie move out.    Alvy's arms and legs fill the screen as he slowly gets up from the floor bolding up a live lobster.  He puts it on a grill tray.    Alvy sits on his bed talking on the phone.   Well, where-wherever you wanna meet, I don't care.  I'll-I'll drive in.  I rented a car I'm driving ... that ... Whatta you mean?  What-why is that such a miracle?  I'm driving myself --   (Over the theater scene and, Annie's singing) She had moved back to New York.  She was living in SoHo with some guy.  And when I met her she was, of all things, dragging him in to see \"The Sorrow and the Pity.\"  Which I counted as a personal triumph.  Annie and I ... (Alvy's voice continues over the scene shot through a window of Manhattan cafe showing Alvy and Annie sitting at a table, laughing and enjoying themselves) ... we had lunch sometime after that, and, uh, just, uh, kicked around old times.  A series of flashbacks following in quick succession while Annie continues to sing:  Annie and Alvy going up the FDR Drive, the day they met playing tennis, Annie driving, Alvy bolding up partially eaten sandwich.  Annie and Alvy in the Hamptons house kitchen, Annie banding a live lobster to Alvy, who drops it in the pot on the stove.  Annie and Alvy walking side by side by the shoreline.  Alvy at the tennis club, packing his bag, as he looks over his shoulder and sees Annie, hands on her face, then clapping, as she offers him a ride home in her car.  Annie opening the door to Alvy the night he came over to kill the spider; Annie and, Alvy in the bookstore buying the \"Death\" titles; Annie and, Alvy in their Hamptons house, Annie reading a school catalogue, the night Alvy puts in the red light.  The memories continue to flash on the screen: Annie and Alvy at a friend's house, Alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa; Annie and Alvy playing tennis; Annie and Alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college performance in Annie's hometown; Alvy bolding Annie close, the night he came over to kill the spider.  And continue: Annie carrying her luggage and clothes into Alvy's bedroom, Alvy following, the day she first moved into his apartment.  Annie holding up her sexy birthday present from Alvy, then leaning over and kissing him; Annie and Alvy walking down a city street, holding each other close; sitting on the park bench, observing the people; and kissing, on the FDR Drive, the New York City skyline behind them. The music stops.  Returning to the present, the camera, focusing through the cafe window, shows Annie and Alvy across street.  They look about at the city traffic.  Lunch is over; it's time.  Alvy and Annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like.  Annie crosses the street, Alvy watching her go.  Then he turns, and slowly walks down the street off screen.  His voice is heard over the scene:   After that it got pretty late.  And we both hadda go, but it was great seeing Annie again, right?  I realized what a terrific person she was and-and how much fun it was just knowing her and I-I thought of that old joke, you know, this- this-this guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, \"Doc, uh, my brother's crazy.  He thinks he's a chicken.\" And, uh, the doctor says, \"Well, why don't you turn him in?\" And the guy says, \"I would, but I need the eggs.\" Well, I guess that's pretty much how how I feet about relationships.  You know, they're totally irrational and crazy and absurd and ... but, uh, I guess we keep goin' through it because, uh, most of us need the eggs.",
        "Dad": "A great sauce.   Duane and I went out to the boat basin.   Yeah.  Randolph Hunt was drunk, as usual.   My God, he's the new president of the El Regis.  Let me tell you, the man is somethin' else.   Fast?   And look up Uncle Bill, you promise.   Oh, no-Duane can.  I haven't finished my drink.",
        "Alvy": "There's an old joke.  Uh, two elderly women are at a Catskills mountain resort, and one of 'em says: \"Boy, the food at this place is really terrible.\" The other one says, \"Yeah, I know, and such ... small portions.\" Well, that's essentially how I feel about life.  Full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness, and it's all over much too quickly.  The-the other important joke for me is one that's, uh, usually attributed to Groucho Marx, but I think it appears originally in Freud's wit and its relation to the unconscious.  And it goes like this-I'm paraphrasing: Uh ... \"I would never wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member.\" That's the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women.  Tsch, you know, lately the strangest things have been going through my mind, 'cause I turned forty, tsch, and I guess I'm going through a life crisis or something, I don't know. I, uh ... and I'm not worried about aging. I'm not one o' those characters, you know. Although I'm balding slightly on top, that's about the worst you can say about me.  I, uh, I think I'm gonna get better as I get older, you know?  I think I'm gonna be the- the balding virile type, you know, as opposed to say the, uh, distinguished gray, for instance, you know?  'Less I'm neither o' those two. Unless I'm one o' those guys with saliva dribbling out of his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria with a shopping bag screaming about socialism.  Annie and I broke up and I-I still can't get my mind around that.  You know, I-I keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind and-and examining my life and tryin' to figure out where did the screw-up come, you know, and a year ago we were... tsch, in love.  You know, and-and-and ... And it's funny, I'm not-I'm not a morose type.  I'm not a depressive character. I-I-I, uh,  you know, I was a reasonably happy kid, I guess.  I was brought up in Brooklyn during World War II.    The universe is expanding.    Well, the universe is everything, and if it's expanding, someday it will break apart and that would be the end of everything!  Disgusted, his mother looks at him.   What's the point?   My analyst says I exaggerate my childhood memories, but I swear I was brought up underneath the roller-   -coaster in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn.  Maybe that accounts for my personality, which is a little nervous, I think.   You know, I have a hyperactive imagination.

She jumps from her seat in disgust, rubbing her cheek, as Alvy moves back to his seat.   What'd I do?   What'd I do?   (First off screen, then onscreen as camera moves over to the back of the classroom) Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.   (Still sitting in the back of the classroom) I did.  The girl the young Alvy kissed turns to the older Alvy, she gestures and speaks.    Well, I never had a latency period.  I can't help it.    Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.   Right.  Sometimes I wonder where my classmates are today.  The camera shows the full classroom, the students sitting behind their desks, the teacher standing in the front of the room.  One at a time, the young students rise u from their desks and speak.   I lost track of most of my old schoolmates, but I wound up a comedian.  They did not take me in the Army.  I was, uh ... Interestingly enough, I was-I was four-P.  Sounds of TV audience laughter and applause are heard.   Yes.  In-in-in-in the event of war, I'm a hostage.  More audience laughter joined by Dick Cavett and the naval officer.    Alvy's  mother sits at the old-fashioned dining-room table peeling carrots and talking as she looks off screen.   I distinctly heard it.  He muttered under his breath, \"Jew.\"   No, I'm not.  We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, \"Jew.\"   Wh- How am I a paran-?  Well, I pick up on those kind o' things.  You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said ... uh, \"Did you eat yet or what?\" and Tom Christie said, \"No, didchoo?\" Not, did you, didchoo eat?  Jew?  No, not did you eat, but Jew eat?  Jew.  You get it? Jew eat?   Stop calling me Max.   No, I don't!  You know, I was in a record store.  Listen to this -so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, \"Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner.\" Wagner, Max, Wagner-so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.   Ah.   Forget it, Max.   No, I cannot.  You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.   I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left.  Right?    No. Yeah, once in a while.  You know, like occasionally.    You wouldn't know it.  It doesn't matter. What's the difference?   Once in a while, you know.  I mean, you know, every now-    I'm ... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.   Alvy Singer. It was nice nice ... Thanks very much ... for everything.  They shake hands and Alvy pats the man's arm.  The man in turn looks over his shoulder and motions to another man. All excited now, he points to Alvy and calls out. Alvy looks impatient.   Fellas ... you know-Jesus!  Come on!    Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!   I need a large polo mallet!    Fellas, what is this-a meeting o' the teamsters?  You know.. .   You don't want my autograph.   (Taking the matchbook and pen and writing) Your girl friend's name is Ralph?   (Overlapping the two men and stuttering) I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas. (As Alvy opens the cab door, the two men still behind him, Annie gets out) Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?   Bad mood?  I'm standing with the cast of \"The Godfather.\"   Deal!  I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!   Hey, you are in a bad mood.  You-you- you must be getting your period.    A li-little louder.  I think one of them may have missed it!  H'm, has the picture started yet?    That's it!  Forget it!  I-I can't go in.    No, I'm sorry, I can't do it.  We-we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.   You wanna get coffee for two hours or something?  We'll go next-    Go ahead.  Good-bye.  Annie moves back to Alvy and takes his arm.   (Watching people with tickets move past them) Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.   I don't know now.  You-you wanna go to another movie? (Annie nods her head and shrugs her shoulders disgustedly as Alvy, gesturing with his band, looks at her) So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.   Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't ... I-I-I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause-'cause I'm anal.    I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.    He's screaming his opinions in my ear.    Key word here is \"indulgent.\"   (To Annie, who is still reading, overlapping the man in line who is still talking) What are you depressed about?   How can you possibly oversleep?    You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?   Hey, you ... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?    I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.  The man in line continues his speech all the while Alvy and Annie talk.    Well, he's spitting on my neck!  You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.    Probably on their first date, right?   Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books.  \"Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy.\"  Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?   I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.   I never read that.  That was-that was Henry James, right?  Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw?  My Sexual ...    What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.    What do you do when you get stuck in a movie line with a guy like this behind you?  I mean, it's just maddening!  The man in line moves toward Alvy.  Both address the audience now.   I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud?  I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that?  And-and the funny part of it is, M-Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's...work!   Oh, do yuh?   Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here.  So ... so, here, just let me-I mean, all right.  Come over here ... a second.  Alvy gestures to the camera which follows him and the man in line to the back of the crowded lobby.  He moves over to a large stand-up movie poster and pulls Marshall McLuban from behind the poster.    Tell him.    Boy, if life were only like this!    Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know?  Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.    You?  You kiddin'? (He moves into the frame, lying across the bed to touch, Annie, who makes a face) If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.   Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.  He starts kissing Annie's arm.  She gets annoyed and continues to read.   What-what-what-what's the matter?    What-what-I don't ... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together.  You know, it's been a long time.    It's always some kind of an excuse.  It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy.  What ... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly ... We're- we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.   M'm.    Excuse ... excuse me, when do I go on?   Alvy ... Alvy Singer.  I'm a comedian.   (Rubbing his hands together nervously) What do you mean, next?    No, it can't be, because he's a comic.   So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?   No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't ... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.   No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not.  If you don't mind, I prefer-    I prefer not to, because ... look, they're laughing at him.  See, so what are yuh telling me-  They move closer to the stage, looking out from the wings.    -that I've got to ... ah ... ah ... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too.  How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.    Look, what's your-what's your name?   Yeah?  Allison what?    Thank you. I-I don't know why they would have me at this kind of rally 'cause ...  Excuse me, I'm not essentially a political comedian at all.  The audience starts to laugh.   I ... interestingly had, uh, dated ... a woman in the Eisenhower Administration ... briefly ... and, uh, it was ironic to me 'cause, uh . . . tsch . . . 'cause I was trying to, u-u-uh, do to her what Eisenhower has been doing to the country for the last eight years.  The audience is with him, laughing, as Allison continues to watch offstage.   H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison ... it's obsessing me!   It-but it-it ... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound.  So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once?  It doesn't make sense.   I'll tell you this!  He was not marksman enough to hit a moving target at that range.  But ...  if there was a second assassin ... it- That's it!  Alvy stops at the music stand with open sheet music on it as Allison gets up from the bed and retrieves a pack of cigarettes from a bookshelf.   If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.   Well, why not?    Hey ... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.   (Propping one knee on the bed and gesturing) L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician.  You know the ethics those guys have?  It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.    Tsch.   I-I-I-I would leave out the men's-room attendant.   Oh, my God!  She's right!  Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik?  She was-she was beautiful.  She was willing.  She was real ... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke?  That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?   Look, I told you it was a ... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.   Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.   If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.   Don't give it to me.  Don't!    Look!  Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator.  It'll turn up in our bed at night. (They move over to the refrigerator; Alvy moves as close to the wall as possible as Annie, covering her mouth and laughing hysterically, teasingly dangles a lobster in front of him) Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!    Talk to him.  You speak shellfish! (He moves over to the stove and takes the lid of a large steamer filled with boiling water) Hey, look ... put it in the pot.    Gimme!  Gimme!  Let me do it!  What-what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?  Annie hands the lobster to Alvy as he takes it very carefully and drops it gingerly into the pot and puts the cover back on.    Okay, it's in.  It's definitely in the pot!   Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator.  I can't get it out. This thing's heavy.  Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?   You know, I-I think ... if I could pry this door off ... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs.  They don't run around.  Annie rushes out of the room to get her camera as Alvy picks up the paddle. Trying to get at the lobsters, he ends up knocking over dishes and hitting the chandelier.  Holding the paddle, he finally leans back against the sink. Annie, standing in the doorway, starts taking pictures of him.   All right!  All right!  All right!  All right!  Whatta yuh mean?  Are yuh gonna take pictures now?   (Picking up the lobster Annie placed on the counter earlier) All right, here!  Oh, God, it's disgusting!  Alvy drops the lobster back down on the counter, sticking out his tongue and making a face.   So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what ...  Am I your first big romance?   Well, then, w-who was?    Dennis-right, uh, uh ... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.    Oh, I can imagine.  P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.    Look at you, you-you,-re such a clown.   Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you ...    Is he kidding with that crap?    You do?   Hey, that was last year.   Heavy!  Eaten by some squirrels.   I-I may throw up!   Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.   La-de-da.  If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like \"la-de-da\" . . .   Well, no ... not just, not only.   Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.    'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.    I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.   Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.   Hey, you wouldn't believe this.  Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now ...  they're ahead two points.    What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on.  But on the other hand ...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.  Alvy reaches over, pulls Robin down onto the bed.  He kisses her and moves farther up on the bed.   No, it'll be great!  It'll be great, be-because all those Ph.D.'s are in there, you know, like ... discussing models of alienation and we'll be in here quietly humping.  He pulls Robin toward him, caressing her as she pulls herself away.   \"'Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?'  he said as he removed her brassiere...\"   Don't get upset!    Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn.  I mean, the city can't close down.  You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too?  No more flights so we can have sex?   Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time.  The country makes me nervous.  There's ... You got crickets and it-it's quiet ... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-   Hey, come on, it's quiet now.  We can-we can start again.   What-   Oh, you got a headache!   Bad?   Jesus!  He begins to get out of bed.   Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.   Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.   But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics.  This is foreskin.   Don't you see?  The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.   Sun is bad for yuh.  Everything our parents said was good is bad.  Sun, milk, red meat, college ...   Hi.    Holy gods!    Hi.  Oh, hi.  Hi.    You-you play ... very well.    Uh ... you-you wanna lift?   No, um ... I was gonna take a cab.   You have a car? (Annie smiles, hands folded in front of her) So ...  I don't understand why ... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say \"Do you have a car?\"... like you wanted a lift?    Sure.  W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?   Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.   Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.    So sorry.    Yeah.  They walk out the door.   So, how long do you know Janet?  Where do you know her from?   Oh - you're an actress.   I, uh ... well, you're not from New York, right?   Right!  Where?    Uh, you're driving a-   No, no thanks.  Hey, don't-   No, no, no, no, you just ... just watch the road.  I'll get it-   -for yuh.   I'll getcha a piece.   Do I drive?  Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.   Yeah.  I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.   Nice car.   You keep it nice. (He pulls a half-eaten sandwich out of her bag) Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?   That's okay, you ... we-we can walk to the curb from here.   You want your tennis stuff?   You want your gear?  Here you go.  Alvy reaches into the back of the car and takes out tennis equipment.  He hands her her things.  People pass by on the street.    Well, thanks, thank you.  You-you're a wonderful tennis player.   You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life . . . that's including any place ... the worst ... Europe, United ... any place ... Asia.   And I love what you're wearin'.  Alvy touches the tie Annie is wearing around her neck.   Who?  Grammy?  Grammy Hall?   You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?   Your grammy!   Jesus, my-my grammy ... n-never gave gifts, you know.  She-she wastoo busy getting raped by Cossacks.   Well ... thank you again.   I'll see yuh.   No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.    No, I got time.   Sure, I got ... I got nothing, uh, nothing till my analyst's appointment.  They move toward Annie's apartment building.   Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.   Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.   Sylvia Plath.   Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.   Oh, sorry.   Neat?   Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that \"neat\" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?   Duane?   Well, who's Sadie?   Uh, narcolepsy.   Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I ... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know ...   ... and ... uh, yeah, uh ... uh, you know, I-I-I...  They move outside to the terrace, Alvy still holding the glasses, Annie the wine.  They stand in front of the railing, Annie pouring the wine into the held-out glasses.   No, I know, but ... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.   Me?  No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.   'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh ...   You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-   -'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.   Fifteen years, yeah.   God bless.    Oh, thank you.   (pointing toward the apartment after a short pause) So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?   They're ... they're... they're wonderful, you know.  They have ... they have, uh ... a ... a quality.  As do Alvy's: You are a great-looking girl   Photography's interesting, 'cause, you know, it's-it's a new art form, and a, uh, a set of aesthetic criteria have not emerged yet.  And Alvy's: I wonder what she looks like naked?   The-the medium enters in as a condition of the art form itself.  That's-  I don't know what I'm saying-she senses I'm shallow   Still, still we- You need a set of aesthetic guide lines to put it in social perspective, I think.  Christ, I sound like FM radio.  Relax  They're quiet for a moment, holding wine glasses and sipping.  The sounds of distant traffic from the street can be heard on the terrace.  Annie, laughing, speaks first.   You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon ... otherwise I- Hey ... well, are you busy Friday night?    Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something.  Well, what about Saturday night?   Oh, you ... you're very popular, I can see.   Gee, boy, what do you have?  You have plague?   Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.   I think that's, uh-   You're gonna sing?  Do you sing?  Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  -this is my first time.  Oh, really?  Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no!  No, I'm interested!    No, so help me.   That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like.  Listen-    -you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.   Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.   No, they didn't.  You have a wonderful voice.   No, I'm not gonna letcha.  You have a great voice.   Yeah!   It's terrific.   Hey, listen, listen.   Gimme a kiss.   Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?   And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension.  You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything.  So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?   And we'll digest our food better.   Okay?   So now we can digest our food.  They turn and start walking again.   Okay. Yeah.    I'm gonna have a corned beef.   Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.   My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault.  I was just... I was too crazy.   As Balzac said ...   \"There goes another novel.\"  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.  Really.  I mean it.  I-I'll never play  Good?  I was-   No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.   No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and   -tried to take my pants off over my  M'hm. (He pushes himself up from the bed and looks down at Annie You're not gonna believe this, but-   Hey?   I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I  Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm,  -big subject with me, yeah.   I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.   Those are the two categories ...   ... you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?   And blind people, crippled ...   I don't-don't know how they get through  You know, and the miserable is everyone  Look, look at that guy.   There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.   (Watching two men approach, one lighting a cigar) Look at these guys.   Oh, that's hilarious.  They're back from Fire Island.  They're ... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?   Yeah, he's the Mafia.  Linen Supply Business  No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.    And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.   You are extremely sexy.   Unbelievably sexy.  Yes, you are. Because ... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.   Uh ... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.   You know what I mean?  Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps ... you get excited.   You- Do you love me?   That's the key question.   I know you've only known me a short while.   I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word  - I ... I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.    Don't you think I do?    Alvy, somewhat distraught, is following Annie around his apartment, which is filled with boxes and suitcases, clothes and framed pictures.  They both carry cartons.   Whatta you mean?  You're not gonna give  Yeah, bu-bu-but why?   Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.   Yeah, I know it's small.  (Picking up some pictures and following Annie into the bedroom) All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing.  You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a ... (Annie, reacting, tosses the suitcases and some loose clothing onto the bed.  She sits down on the edge, looking away. Alvy walks in, pictures and carton in band, still talking) ... rapidly growing field.   How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?   Ye-ah.  Was it ... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.   No-what, what ...? I ... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together.  Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?  He moves over to the carton of books on the window seat and reaches in.  He starts tossing books off screen.    It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment. (Holding a book, he starts walking around the room) Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft ... that we know that we're not married.  He tosses the book on the bed and walks back to the window seat.    That place is four hundred dollars a month?    It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs.  Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.   Hey, don't be ridiculous.  Alvy moves over to the bed and sits down next to Annie.    'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.   Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.   No, don't be silly.  What-what do we need other people for? (He puts his arms around her neck, kissing her, Annie making muffled sounds) You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.   (Yelling out to her as she leaves the room) Yeah, grass, right?  The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.   Me, no.  You ... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful.  I get too, too wonderful for words.  You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.   Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?   Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal.  You can sleep through it.   Oh, come, you don't need that.  Alvy, sitting down on the bed, moves over to Annie and takes the weed from her.    No, no, no, what ... You can once, you can live without it once.  Come on.   M'm, wait, I got a great idea. (He gets up and goes over to the closet, taking out a light bulb. He goes back to the bed and turns out the lamp on the night table) Hang in there for a second.  I got a little-little artifact.  A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect. (He turns the lamp back on, having replaced the bulb with the red one from the closet) I just ... there ... There's a little Old New Orleans ... essence.  Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to.  There, now there. (He undresses and crawls into bed, taking Annie in his arms) M'mmm.  M'mmm.  Hey, is something wrong?   I don't know.  You- It's like you're- you're removed.   Really?   I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.    Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?    You see, that's what I call removed.   Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.   Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass   because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-    -so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count.  You know-'cause they're always laughin'.   Hey, what is this-an interview?  We're supposed to be making love.    Jesus, this guy's pathetic.   (To himself while the comic continues his routine) Look at him mincing around, like he thinks he's real cute.  You wanna throw up.  If only I had the nerve to do my own jokes.  I don't know how much longer I can keep this smile frozen on my face. I'm in the wrong business, I know it.    W-where am I? I-I keep ... I have to reorient myself.  This is the University of Wisconsin, right?  So I'm always ... I'm tense and ... uh, when I'm playin' a col- I've a very bad history with colleges. You know, I went to New York University and, uh, tsch, I was thrown out of NYU my freshman year ... for cheating on my metaphysics final. You know, I looked within the soul of the boy sitting next to me-   -and when I was thrown out, my mother, who's an emotionally high-strung woman, locked herself in the bathroom and took an overdose of mah-jongg tiles.  And, uh, tsch, I was depressed.  I was ... in analysis, I-I, uh, was suicidal; as a matter of fact, uh, I would have killed myself but I was in analysis with a strict Freudian and if you kill yourself ... they make you pay for the sessions you miss.   C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.   Are yuh?   Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.    You're so sure about it.   Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.   Yeah.   It is.  It's dynamite ham.  Grammy Hall stares down the table at Alvy; a look of utter dislike. Alvy tries not to notice.    Yes.  I'm making excellent progress. Pretty soon when I lie down on his couch, I won't have to wear the lobster bib.  Mom Hall reacts by sipping from her glass and frowning.  Grammy continues to stare.    I can't believe this family.  Annie's mother.  She really's beautiful. And they're talkin' swap meets and boat basins, and the old lady at the end of the table  is a classic Jew hater.  And, uh, they, they realty look American, you know, very healthy and ... like they never get sick or anything.  Nothing like my family.  You know, the two are like oil and water.  The screen splits in half - on the right is Alvy's family - his mother, father, aunt and uncle-busily eating at the crowded kitchen table.  They eat quickly and interrupt one another loudly.  On the left the Halls in their dining room. Both dialogues overlap, juxtaposed.   Let 'im drop dead!  Who needs his business?!   His wife has diabetes!   Di-diabetes?  Is that any excuse? Diabetes?   The man is fifty years old and doesn't have a substantial job.   (Putting more meat on her husband's plate) Is that a reason to steal from his father?   Whatta you talkin' about?  You don't know what you're talking about.   Yes, I know what I'm talking about.    George, defend him!    No Moskowitz he had a coronary.   You don't say.   We fast.   Yeah, no food.  You know, we have to atone for our sins.   Tell you the truth, neither do we.    Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?    Oh, yeah?  Terrific.    Right.  Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.  He slowly gets up and moves toward the door.    I didn't follow you!   Why?  'Cause I ... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!    Following is different.  I was spying.   Paranoid?  I'm looking at you.  You got your arms around another guy.   Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh.  Pick you up after school.   Oh, stop it.  But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course \"Contemporary Crisis in Western Man\"!   What's the difference?  It's all mental masturbation.    Hey, don't knock masturbation!  It's sex with someone I love.    \"Neat\"!  There's that- What are you-twelve years old?  That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions!  \"He thinks I'm neat.\"   Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know?  Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!  They both stop in the middle of the street.   David?  You call your teacher David?   Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's   Oh, yeah?  How'd it go?   Yeah?   M'm.   Me?  I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so ... you know.   G-go on, I'm interested.   M'hm.   Tsch.  Rea- All this happened in the first hour?   That's amazing. I-I-I ... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got ... nothing like that in-   You cried?  I've never once cried. Fantastic ...   I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.   Sinatra?   Yeah?   (Taking a bottle of juice and some celery from the bag) Well, well, sure ... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect.  So you're trying to suffocate yourself.  It-it makes perfect sense.  Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic ... kind of insight.    Whatta you mean?  Me?    Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses.  So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?    Tsch, what'd the doctor say?   Will it change your wife?   Yeah, but you said, \"Will it change my wife\"!   You said, \"Will it change. . .\" Wife. Will it change ...    She said, \"Will it change my wife.\" You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.     Adult education is such junk!  The professors are so phony.  How can you do it?    David!  David!  I can't believe this!  I'm following you and David, if you-   That's fine.  That's fine.  That's great!     Large vibrating egg.  Well, I ask a psychopath, I get that kind of an answer. Jesus, I-I, uh, here ... (He moves up the sidewalk to a young trendy-looking couple, arms wrapped around each other) You-you look like a really happy couple. Uh, uh ... are you?   Yeah!  So ... so h-h-how do you account  I see.  Well, that's very interesting. So you've managed to work out something, huh?   Oh, well, thanks very much for talking to me.  He continues to walk past some other passersby and moves into the street. A mounted policeman comes by and stops near him. Alvy looks at the horse, as if to speak.   You know, even as a kid I always went for the wrong women.  I think that's my problem.  When my mother took me to see Snow White, everyone fell in love with Snow White.  I immediately fell for the Wicked Queen.  The scene dissolves into a sequence from the animated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  The Wicked Queen, resembling Annie, sits in the palace before her mirror.  Alvy, as a cartoon figure, sits beside her, arms crossed in front of him.   How can you say that?   You're just upset.  You must be getting  I don't wanna go out with any other women.   Man, that's great.  That's just great.    Me?  No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.    Tsch, a few.   I can think of another word.   Really?  It must be a tremendous hem.   Are you?   I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics.  Look- (The Maharisbi, a small, chunky man, walks out of the men's room, huge bodyguards flanking him while policemen bold back the crowds there's God coming outta the men's room.   Yeah, were yuh?  I was-I was at an Alice   The reporter is sitting up in bed, lighted cigarette in her hand.  Alvy, lying next to her, rubs his eyes and puts on his eyeglasses.     Oh, tsch, thank you.  H'm.    I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.    Uh, oh, I don't know.  It might have been Leopold and Loeb. (The telephone rings.  Alvy picks it up, rising up slightly from the bed, concerned, as he talks) Hello.  Oh, hi ... Uh, no, what-what's the matter?  What-what-what?  You sound terrible ... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh -what kind of an emergency? ... No, well, stay there.  Stay there, I'll come over right now.  I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.  He hangs up.  The reporter sits in bed still, taking in the situation.   What's- It's me, open up.   Are you okay?  What's the matter?   What?   That's what you got me here for at three    Kill it!  For Go- What's wrong with you?    Jesus.  All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired. (While Annie goes of to find him a magazine, Alvy, still talking, glances around the apartment.  He notices a small book on a cabinet and picks it up.) You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything.  An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake.  Hey, what is this? What?  Did you go to a rock concert?   Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it?  Was it-was it, I mean, did it ... was it heavy?  Did it achieve total heavy-ocity?  Or was it, uh...       It's wonderful.  Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?   Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock  Hey, what am I-your son?  Whatta you mean?  Yeah, where is the spider?  Is he in the bathroom?  (Moving down the hallway to   Very big spider.   Two ... Yeah.  Lotta, lotta trouble.        Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom  Hey, what is this?  You got black soap?  Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show?    Oh, Jesus, really?  What?  He touches her face gently as she wipes tears from her face.   W-w-whatta you mean?  Oh, I had the radio on.   I'm sorry.  I had the television set ... I had the television-    Alvy is lying in bed next to Annie, who is leaning on her elbow looking down at him.  He rubs her arms and she smiles.   Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.   It's all right for me, it's been terrific,  I don't know.   Tsch, why don't we get ... why don't  That'd be fun for yuh.  Don't you think-   Hey, can yuh watch the road?  Watch the --  You'll total the whole car.   Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.  Right.  I was a great athlete.  Tell  Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.   Oh, look, look, there's that ... that's -that's my old house.  That's where I used to live.   I have some very good memories there.   Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.    Alvy's father sits in his chair.  His mother is polishing a door while Alvy lies on the floor playing.  Annie, adult Alvy and Rob quietly walk into the scene to watch.   You fired the cleaning woman?   She was stealing.   But she's colored.    So the colored have enough trouble.   She was going through my pocketbook!   They're persecuted enough!   Who's persecuting?  She stole!  Alvy's father gets up and gets his hard hat.  He sits back down and starts polishing it.   All right-so we can afford it.  How can we afford it?  On your pay?  She's a colored woman, from Harlem!    Leo ... I married a fool!  It-it-it's the welcome-home party      I was always the sister with good common      Ah?  Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.   Yeah, but no presents till midnight.  Happy birthday.   Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?  Try it ... it'll add years to our sex life.   Here's a real present.   Check it out.       Thank you very much.  It's a pleasure.    Remember, we had that thing.   (Staring at Annie and clearing   -yes, we had, uh ...    What's ... you ... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?      Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.   How often do you sleep together?  Hardly ever.  Maybe three times a week.   She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-   I mean ... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my-my red light bulb, and ...   The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.    You know ... it's getting expensive ...my analyst ... for her analyst.  She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress.  Her progress is defeating my progress.   Hey, don't put it on me.  You kn- Wh-what is it, I don't wanna put a wad of white powder in my nose 'cause the-the nasal membranes ...  They all start talking at once.    How can you say that?  I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.   Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.  Annie laughs, chatters.   Oh, yeah?    Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.   ... I'm thrilled.  As you know, uh ...  It's so phony, and we have to leave New York during Christmas week, which really kills me.    Sure, sure, I'll be glad to. I-I'll just put it in a-a-a h-h-hollow heel that I have in my boot, you know. (Alvy picks up the small open gold case of cocaine base the man placed on the coffee table and looks at it, reacting) H-h-how much is this stuff?   Really?  And what is the kick of it?  Yeah, the architecture is really consistent, isn't it?  French next to-   -Spanish, next to Tudor, next to Japanese.   It's that they don't throw their garbage away.  They make it into television shows.   Can you believe this is Christmas here?   Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.   There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.    Oh.   Do you realize how immoral this all is?   Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.  Technicians turn the monitors back on, showing Rob on the screen with another character, Arnie.   Look, uh ...  Loud laughter from the TV monitors.   Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.   (Removing his glasses and rubbing his face) Is there booing on there?  The monitors show a woman on the screen.    Oh, Max, I don't feel well.   I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.    Oh, Jesus.   I don't know, I mean, I-   No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning.  I just started getting ...   Oh, Max ... no, I maybe I better lie down.   (Taking a piece of chicken and holding it) Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank ... and give out an award on a TV show.    I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?  Reacting, Alvy puts up his band in disgust, then starts eating the piece of chicken he has been holding.  The doctor and Annie watch him, reacting.   Christ!   (Grabbing the rest of the chicken from the plate) Oh, jesus. Can I have the salt, please?    This is not bad, actually.    Hey, don't tell me we're gonna hafta walk from the car to the house.  Geez, my feet haven't touched pavement since I reached Los Angeles.   M'hm.   Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.   I think he has a little thing for Annie.   Where?  Rob nods his head toward a tall woman dressed all in white conversing with a group of people close-by.    Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're -you're used to twos, aren't you?   Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.   And ... uh-   Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's ... I think she's giving me the eye.  As Rob and Alvy observe the guests, the woman in white starts walking toward them.   I'll handle it.  I'll handle it.  Hi.   EST?  No, no, I was never to est.   Oh.    No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I ... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?   Yeah, he's crazy.    Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.   Trigger.  Annie and the girl in white laugh.   Hey.   Yeah, this place is great.   Yeah, I love it there.   I'm into garbage.  It's my thing.    Oh, yeah?   I'm cool.  Tony and the girl in white leave the room, Annie and Alvy following.   Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.   Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side.  But it's...  They pass a man talking on the phone in the hallway.    Lotta beautiful women.  It was fun to flirt.   (An open magazine lies in his lap) I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight.  Whatta I need this?   If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out.  It'd probably wreck her.  But I should be honest.  He looks over at Annie.   Tsch, I know.  A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know?  It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.    A lighted Christmas tree stands in the middle of boxes, books, and the general disarray of packing and figuring out what belongs to whom as Alvy helps Annie move out.    Whose \"Catcher in the Rye\" is this?    Oh, it sure has ... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.    There's no-no question in my mind.  I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.    This \"Denial of Death\".  You remember this?   This is the first book that I got you.  Annie goes over to Alvy.  They both look down at the book; the fireplace, burning nicely, is behind them.   Remember that day?   Thanks, honey.   There's no-there's no question about that, 'cause we've given this ... uh, uh, I think a more than fair shot, you know?  He tosses the book into the carton.    Yeah, and I-I tru-  you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.   Right.  And you-and you know what the beauty part is?    We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause ... Right.   You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this.  You know, they could just break up and remain friends.    Yeah.    I miss Annie.  I made a terrible mistake.  A couple, walking down the street, stops as the man talks to Alvy.   Oh, yeah?  Well, if she is, then the hell with her!  If she likes that lifestyle, let her live there!  He's a jerk, for one thing.   Yeah. He may- Listen, Harvard makes  Yeah, jealous. A little bit like Medea. Lemme, lemme-can I show you something, lady? (He takes a small item from his pocket to show the woman) What I have here ... I found this in the apartment.  Black soap.  She used to wash her face eight hundred times a day with black soap. Don't ask me why.   Well, I-I tried, but it's, uh, you know, it's very depressing.    Alvy's arms and legs fill the screen as he slowly gets up from the floor bolding up a live lobster.  He puts it on a grill tray.    This always happens to me.  Quick, g-go get a broom.  His date, a girl wearing short shorts, leans against the sink and lights a cigarette.  She makes no move to help.   (Looking up in stooped-over position) I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.   Sixteen years ago.    Mean?    Alvy sits on his bed talking on the phone.   Listen, honey, Central Park's turning green ... Yeah, I sa-I saw that lunatic that we-where we used to see ... with the, uh, uh, pinwheel hat and, you know, and the roller skates? . . . Listen, I-I want you to come back here ... Well, I-I-then I'm gonna come out there and getcha.   Whatta you mean, where am I? Where do- where do you think I am?  I'm-I'm out ... I'm at the Los Angeles Airport. I flew in ...  Tsch, I-well, I flew in to see you ...  Hey, listen, can we not debate this on-on the telephone because I'm, you know, I-I feel that I got a temperature and I'm-I'm getting my-my chronic Los Angeles nausea. I-I don't feel so good.  Alvy's conversation is still heard as the screen shows him behind the wheel of a car on a busy street; he causes a near-accident by jerking the car too slowly toward an intersection.   Well, where-wherever you wanna meet, I don't care.  I'll-I'll drive in.  I rented a car I'm driving ... that ... Whatta you mean?  What-why is that such a miracle?  I'm driving myself --    I'm gonna...I'm gonna have the alfalfa sprouts and, uh, a plate of mashed yeast.  Annie, wearing a flowered dress and wide hat, moves into view.  Alvy, noticing her, watches as she walks over to his table.  He rises and they shake hands.   You look very pretty.    You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.   Why?  You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.    So whatta you ... You're not gonna come back to New York?   Hey, you didn't read \"Death in Venice\" till I bought it for yuh.    That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.    I can't enjoy anything unless I ... unless everybody is.  I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's ... you know, I-I ... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?    Okay.  Check, please.  Can I -can I ... Can I ... Can I ...    No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.    The usual, you know. Uh, tryin't'write. I'm workin' on a play.  Jesus.  So whatta yuh saying?  That you're not comin' back to New York with me?  He nods his head in disbelief.   You mean that ... (He gets up and starts following her past diners at other tables) I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.   Air miles, you know.  I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?  They move down the steps of the cafe' toward the parking lot.   The what?   You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?   I thought just earplugs.  Annie gets into her car.  Alvy moves over to his rented convertible.    Awards! They do nothing but give out awards!  I can't believe it.  Greatest, greatest fascist dictator, Adolf Hitler!  Annie drives away. Alvy gets behind the wheel, starts the motor. Putting the car in gear, he inadvertently moves forward, hitting a bunch of trash cans with a loud crash. Putting the car in reverse, Alvy notices a beige car that has just turned into the parking lot. For a brief moment, the screen shows a flashback of the bumper-car ride at the Brooklyn amusement park.  Alvy's father is on the Platform directing traffic; young Alvy is in a small car bumping others right and left.  Alvy, hack in the parking lot, backs up his convertible, purposefully smashing the side of the beige car as another flashback of bumper- car ride appears, this time-as, Alvy's father directs traffic-a Marine in a small car bits the back end of a soldier's car, and Alvy, back in the parking lot, moves his car over to another parked car and bits it full force.  Another flashback appears. people in the small cars really racing around the track now, bumping into one another over and over again, Alvy's father directing the flow, as the film cuts back to the parking lot, where Alvy reverses the convertible and rams it into the front end of yet another car.  He sits behind the wheel as people rush out of various cars and as sirens start blaring, coming closer and closer, stopping finally as a motorcycle cop gets off beside Alvy's car and walks over to him.    Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with-with-with-   Sure. (Searching, he finally fishes his license out of his pocket) just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean?  'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here.  You know, it's a rented car.  And I've ...  He drops the license and it falls to the ground.   Pick up the license.  You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day.  You know, my girl friend-   Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse. (He leans over, picks up the license, then proceeds to rip it up.  He lets the pieces go; they float to the ground ... have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know.  I'm... it's not your fault.  Don't take it personal.   So long, fellas.  Keep in touch.  He walks down the corridor off screen.   (Carrying his jacket over his shoulder) Yeah.  I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment.  You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.  They walk over to Rob's convertible and get in.    You're an actor, Max.  You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.    Max, are we driving through plutonium?    Tsch, whatta you want?  It was my first play.  You know, you know how you're always tryin' t' get things to come out perfect in art because, uh, it's real difficult in life.  Interestingly, however, I did run into Annie again.  It was on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  Annie, singing \"Seems Like Old Times, \" overlaps Alvy's speech and continues over the next scene, where Alvy, standing in front of a Manhattan theater, shakes hands with Annie and her escort.  The theater marquee reads \"OPHULS  (Over the theater scene and, Annie's singing) She had moved back to New York.  She was living in SoHo with some guy.  And when I met her she was, of all things, dragging him in to see \"The Sorrow and the Pity.\"  Which I counted as a personal triumph.  Annie and I ... (Alvy's voice continues over the scene shot through a window of Manhattan cafe showing Alvy and Annie sitting at a table, laughing and enjoying themselves) ... we had lunch sometime after that, and, uh, just, uh, kicked around old times.  A series of flashbacks following in quick succession while Annie continues to sing:  Annie and Alvy going up the FDR Drive, the day they met playing tennis, Annie driving, Alvy bolding up partially eaten sandwich.  Annie and Alvy in the Hamptons house kitchen, Annie banding a live lobster to Alvy, who drops it in the pot on the stove.  Annie and Alvy walking side by side by the shoreline.  Alvy at the tennis club, packing his bag, as he looks over his shoulder and sees Annie, hands on her face, then clapping, as she offers him a ride home in her car.  Annie opening the door to Alvy the night he came over to kill the spider; Annie and, Alvy in the bookstore buying the \"Death\" titles; Annie and, Alvy in their Hamptons house, Annie reading a school catalogue, the night Alvy puts in the red light.  The memories continue to flash on the screen: Annie and Alvy at a friend's house, Alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa; Annie and Alvy playing tennis; Annie and Alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college performance in Annie's hometown; Alvy bolding Annie close, the night he came over to kill the spider.  And continue: Annie carrying her luggage and clothes into Alvy's bedroom, Alvy following, the day she first moved into his apartment.  Annie holding up her sexy birthday present from Alvy, then leaning over and kissing him; Annie and Alvy walking down a city street, holding each other close; sitting on the park bench, observing the people; and kissing, on the FDR Drive, the New York City skyline behind them. The music stops.  Returning to the present, the camera, focusing through the cafe window, shows Annie and Alvy across street.  They look about at the city traffic.  Lunch is over; it's time.  Alvy and Annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like.  Annie crosses the street, Alvy watching her go.  Then he turns, and slowly walks down the street off screen.  His voice is heard over the scene:   After that it got pretty late.  And we both hadda go, but it was great seeing Annie again, right?  I realized what a terrific person she was and-and how much fun it was just knowing her and I-I thought of that old joke, you know, this- this-this guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, \"Doc, uh, my brother's crazy.  He thinks he's a chicken.\" And, uh, the doctor says, \"Well, why don't you turn him in?\" And the guy says, \"I would, but I need the eggs.\" Well, I guess that's pretty much how how I feet about relationships.  You know, they're totally irrational and crazy and absurd and ... but, uh, I guess we keep goin' through it because, uh, most of us need the eggs.",

He was in the choir with you.   Stupid Thelma Poindexter ... to the Veterans Hospital.   That's Jack's wife.  We used to make that outta raisins.   Oh, you remember her, Annie.

        "Robin": "There's Henry Drucker.  He has a chair in history at Princeton.  Oh, the short man is Hershel Kaminsky.  He has a chair in philosophy at Cornell.   Why are you so hostile?    Is that Paul Goodman?  No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book.  Hi, Doug!  Douglas Wyatt. \"A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of-the-Heart.\"  They move through the rooms, Robin holding a drink in one hand, her arm draped in Alvy's; the crowd mills around them.   Commentary.   No jokes-these are friends, okay?   Here you are.  There's people out there.   Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?   Stop acting out.  She sits on the edge of the bed, looking down at the sprawled-out Alvy.   Alvy, don't!  You're using sex to express hostility.    There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine.  My God!  What would they think?  She gets up and fixes the zipper on her dress.  She turns and moves toward the door.   Oh, I'm sorry!   Dammit!  I was so close.  She flips on the overhead lamp and turns on her side.  Alvy turns to her.   (Reaching over for her eyeglasses on the night table) I'm too tense.  I need a Valium.  My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.    Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense.  Where's the goddamn Valium?  She fumbles about the floor for the Valium, then back on the bed.   I can't.   My head is throbbing.   I have a headache.   Oswald and ghosts.   Where are you going?"

    "description": "Alvy Singer, a forty year old twice divorced, neurotic, intellectual Jewish New York City stand-up comic, reflects on the demise of his latest relationship, to Annie Hall, an insecure, flighty, Midwestern WASP aspiring nightclub singer. Unlike his previous relationships, Alvy believed he may have worked out all the issues in his life through fifteen years of therapy to make this relationship with Annie last, among those issues being not wanting to date any woman that would want to date him, and thus subconsciously pushing those women away. Alvy not only reviews the many ups and many downs of their relationship, but also reviews the many facets of his makeup that led to him starting to date Annie. Those facets include growing up next to Coney Island in Brooklyn, being attracted to the opposite sex for as long as he can remember, and enduring years of Jewish guilt with his constantly arguing parents.—Huggo",
