        "Siegel": "Yeah, come in.        Aaah, I'd rather stay home and count the wrinkles on my dog's balls. These fuckin' things are like getting measured for your coffin. He don't look so good. Let's give him an honorary award.'     A little experiment. You be me hearing you. The TV we're watching sits in a room with a couple of Golden Globes and pictures of a younger Lester.  Six people in the middle of a city of, what, four million -- ON TV, a wild-eyed woman in the crowd (in one of the most widely-played clips of the hostage crisis) makes an ax- falling gesture with her arm repeatedly.  -- who chant Death to America' all the livelong day. You wanna set up a picture in a week. Lie to a whole town of people who lie for a living. Have Double-O-Seven here sneak into a country that wants CIA blood with their breakfast cereal. Duck Iranian intelligence. Then walk the Brady Bunch out of the most watched city in the world...  Look, I wanna help you but... In the Army, we did suicide missions that had better odds. So lemme hit it again for the cheap seats:  They're getting the ratings, I'll give em that -- Siegel looks at the TV: at that moment, a HOSTAGE TAKER holding up photos of hostages for CAMERAS in front of him. He takes a beat.  We're gonna need a script. A beat of silence. A LOOK from Siegel to Chambers.  Nobody makes Westerns anymore.  If it's got horses in the title, it's a Western.  If I'm doing a fake movie, it's gonna be a fake hit.        It's in turnaround. It's dog shit.  You're worried about the Ayatollah? Try the WGA.  He's only a prick if you catch him on the wrong day.  It's always the wrong day.  He's the money.  -- Till I read the Argo. Look, how bout we say fifteen thou and close on this?  Naah, bullshit me, Max.  Thank you. Very respectful.     But see -- it worries me, what you said, and I'll tell you why. A couple weeks back I was sitting in Trader Vic's enjoying a Mai Tai when my pal Warren Beatty came to wish me well and we had a little chat. Seems he was attached to star in Zulu Empire -- which was gonna anchor that MGM slate -- but Warren confided in me that the picture's gone over-budget cause the Zulu extras wanna unionize.  They may be cannibals swallowing each other up but they want health and dental, so the movie's kaput -- which means that MGM deal ain't gonna happen and your script ain't worth the buffalo-shit on a nickel. So. Lester takes some documents out of a folder.  The way this looks to me -- through the cataracts, I grant you -- is that you can either sign here and take ten thousand for your toilet-paper script -- or you can go fuck yourself. Siegel smiles kindly and holds a pen and the contracts out to Klein. Klein takes them.  I took a leak next to him at the Golden Globes. Taco?  Two daughters.  I talk to them once a year, maybe.  I was a terrible father. The bullshit business is like coal mining. You can't wash it off before you kiss your wife and kids... You?  You're divorced?      -- press event and reading... No, I promised Variety exclusive on that one... Mendez is making a list with a PUBLICIST.   I gotta get back to you, Phil. I can't get my own mother a ticket. I had to tell her it was cancelled.   You know what gets more suckers than a sign that says Brooklyn Bridge For Sale'? Brooklyn Bridge: Approved Buyers Only.'  Philip? You there? Chambers leads us into the main room, leading Tony to a table where JACK KIRBY, 62, comics artist, fusses with large COMIC PANELS of ARGO CONCEPT DRAWINGS spread over a table. Kirby starts to distribute storyboards. Some hold on to them and an ASSISTANT begins putting them up on the board. Mendez looks at them. Impressed. He picks up a drawing of some futuristic-looking vehicles.  You're gorgeous. You're in the reading?  Keep that fucking space witch away from me.  I was married to her. Mendez, now talking to RODD, from VARIETY.  A Hollywood Reporter writer talking to Siegel. The publicist stands by --  The Argo, it's the, y'know, the     No.  It means Argo fuck yourself.  I made thirty pictures. Half of them the pricks upstairs tried to shut me down. Mendez finishes packing, zips up the bag.  My ass is staying right here and running a movie company. Mendez stops zipping as Siegel takes a bottle of Jack and three shot glasses from a drawer.     Argo fuck yourself. They each do a shot. Then Tony picks up his bag and heads out. Before he gs --  There's always another prick one floor higher up.  Bad news, bad news, even when it's good news it's bad news. Christ. (a phone starts  Til the dawn's early light.  You wouldn't be me for long. I'm 80. Producer walks away and Lester looks into the Argo' office as he squeezes the ball. FROM INSIDE THE OFFICE -- In the foreground, we see what Lester is looking at: a phone. Stubbornly silent.  They can wait. Let's go get a drink.  I'm sorry, pally. We're just gonna be in the movie. Call my agent.    It's history, is what it is. History plays out first as farce, then as tragedy.'  Who said it?  Groucho?  She said, Why couldn't we pull off something like that?' You know what I said to her?  I said, Argo fuck yourself.'",
        "Tony": "staring at the movie. Wheels turning in his head.",
        "Mendez": "Yeah. He listens for a moment, then sits up, suddenly wide- awake.  Ten weeks State's sitting on this?  Compromised?  White House?  Who else knows?  Jesus Christ.  Who's handling? They walk through a door and out of the Pit.  They don't do exfils.  Then why's he want me?  You can send in training wheels and wait at the border with Gatorade. Attention turns to Mendez. O'Donnell shifts. Engell, not happy.  It's 300 miles to the Turkish crossings. They'd need a support crew behind them with a tire pump.      They get caught with journalist creds, you've got Peter Jennings with a noose around his neck in an hour. PAUL LAMONT, late 20s, a Master's from the Woodrow Wilson School before he joined CIA --  The school was shut eight months ago. Bates, meanwhile, removing a binder from his accordion folder: in the binder, a photograph of an emaciated kid in Namibia.  What do you see in the picture, sir? A beat. Pender dsn't like this, but he'll play.  What's on the ground?  So what crops are the do-gooders inspecting under Frosty? Pender shifts.  Exfils are like abortions. You don't wanna need one, but when you do, you don't do it yourself. The meeting is breaking up. Pender, followed by Bates, leaves the room. Engell, who has just been made to look bad and inherited a problem, stops by Tony.           Buddy-man.  You do homework tonight?  What was it? But Tony can hear a television soundtrack with ominous ARGO - Final 28.  What do I hear?  What channel?  Catch me up. Tony listens, staring ahead at the TV . A desert used to speak about.  Hi. Sorry. Hi.  They're a Canadian film crew on a location scout for a science fiction movie -- A shift in the room.  Star Wars, Star Trek. They need an exotic place to shoot. We put it out -- the Canadian producers put it out -- that they're looking at Turkey, Egypt, whatever. Then we go to the consulate and say we wanna look at Iran. I fly in there and we fly out together as a film crew. Done.  This is more plausible than foreigners who want to go to school in Iran --  I've got a contact in L.A.     Remind me who you are again?  What are you shooting?  Any good?  Who's the target audience?  It's an exfil.  Worst place you can think of.  Six got away. They're hiding in the city. I'm going over to get them.  I need you to help me make a fake movie.  I need to set up a production company and build a cover around making a movie.  No.  That's right.  No.  Can you teach a guy how to be a director in a day?  I'm the producer.  ... and past a hundred Komiteh at the airport.  That's too soon.   Fade in on starship landing. An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe. Women gather, offering ecstatic libations to the sky gods.' ARGO. A science-fantasy adventure.' Mendez throws down the script.  It's a space movie in the Middle East. Ds it matter? Chambers looks at the BULLSEYE logo on the cover page. Reacts.  Why do we need the option?  Is it the wrong day?  One month.  Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films.  You know Warren Beatty?  You got kids, Lester?  You see them much?  Why's that?  A son. Lives with his mother in Virginia.  Taking time off.  He's gotta... stay where he is.   War' sounds like Star Wars. Let's use a different word. Mendez closes the door to his private office.  I need another week.  We've got a script. We've got business cards.We've got a poster. If I'm them? It's nothing we couldn't make at home.  Biggest Canadian production in history.' Canadian Gone With The  Are you turning people away?  Any way to make the chariots look more -- Middle-Eastern -- ?  Iran. Kirby takes out a marker and starts to sketch a futuristic-looking desert glider.  Tehran.  Why'd he do it?  It's a death sentence, Jack.  Argo fuck yourself. They each do a shot. Then Tony picks up his bag and heads out. Before he gs --  How'd you always get around the pricks upstairs?  I used your name. ARGO - Final 55.  You can forget about that time- share in Ocean City, Jack.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  -- two, we think everybody knows Hollywood people. And everybody thinks they would shoot during Stalingrad with Pol Pot directing if it'd sell tickets. There are only bad options. It's about finding the best one.         Barely claim me as it is.  Just Christine. They don't need to look at one another. A shared understanding.  Guess I should have brought some books to read in prison.  We've got a green light. Chambers gives Siegel a thumbs-up.  Keep the office running till you hear otherwise.  Business. Film production. The Consul Official looks at his Canadian passport.  My boss waited until I was here to send the telex. If he had a thought in his head, it would die of loneliness. Pointed look from Mendez. The universal condition of boss hatred almost always works for him, and it ds now. Consul nods. Stamps the passport. KINGDOM OF IRAN -- He crosses out KINGDOM and writes by hand: ISLAMIC REPUBLIC  Can't be right all the time.  When'd you get back?  Were you metal detecting?  But you kept busy.  So if they look, they'll know six people didn't come in with me.  How's June?  I'm sorry.  Good. Yeah.  Six more are joining me today. They're coming from Canada.  The bazaar, maybe the palace.  Mr. Ambassador.  You're thinking of FBI, sir. They get into the car.  I'll take care of that.  A day to prep them with their cover stories. Two if they need it.  The chances are good.  There are no Canadians in the country for normal reasons.  That's why I'm here. I'll be with you. This is what I do.  This would be a first.  Harkins.  No.  If we go, you need to leave immediately. There's a  I don't know.  Your cover identities were created specifically for each one of you.  What I need you to do is memorize everything inside. Who you are, what you are, where you've been. Cora Lijek looks at a document from inside her envelope. A union card for the Canadian Writers Guild with her picture on it.  When we're done, you'll know these so well that you'll dream as these people. Mendez nods at them, and gs. The Houseguests look at what's inside their envelopes -- all except J Stafford, whose envelope remains sealed.  The Minister of Culture and Guidance has approved your location scout.'   He will send a representative to meet you and your crew at the Khayyam entrance to the Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 PM.'  Or maybe they're cooperating.  Seven Canadians, Jack.  They're getting there.     What I know is we need to act like a movie crew. We go to the bazaar today, we fly out tomorrow. Silent assent among the group. Then J Stafford, sitting with his wife, speaks up --  I'm asking you to trust me.  This one, how much? One day, how much?  I promise you that if you will play along today, I will get you out tomorrow.  My name is Tony Mendez. Mendez gs back out to the minivan. STAY WITH J and Kathy.  Tell me who you are. This recalls attention from the windows.  Let's make a movie.     If I said you were looking through the wrong end of that viewfinder, would I be right? Lee turns the viewfinder around and looks through it again.  She's the production designer. Her job is to take photographs. SHOPKEEPER getting more and more heated in Farsi.  Nobody broke. At the door to the residence, Tony can see Pat Taylor, holding Sahar's hand, both looking spooked as the Houseguests come inside.  Tomorrow they'll be ready. We start to hear the sound of the evening's call to prayer, amplified over a megaphone, in the distance.  Where was your passport issued? Bob Anders dsn't know. ANGLES ON the Houseguests.  Where were you born?  Toronno like piranha. Canadians don't pronounce the T.  If you're held for questioning, they'll bring in somebody who knows that.   Last three Canadian prime minsters.  Good.  Your job on the film.  Associate Producer. What's the name of the last film you worked on?  Who paid for the movie?  What's your middle name? J Stafford is silent. He looks down to consult the paper in front of him, but before he can, Mendez pulls the paper.  He's an American spy. Shoot him. A beat on Stafford, frustrated --  They'll try to break you by getting you agitated. You need to know your rÃ©sumÃ© so well that you don't flinch.  My story's the only thing between you and the gun to your head. A beat. Mendez puts the rÃ©sumÃ© back in front of Stafford. Kathy looks at her husband: he just isn't good at this.  Let's go again.  What is it?  I never would have exposed them if I wasn't authorized to take them out.  They will be taken. Probably not  We're responsible for those people.   I think the most important thing you can do to be ready for tomorrow is rest.  So you know.  Somebody is responsible for things when things happen, Jack. I am responsible. I'm taking them through. And before Jack can answer, Tony hangs up. Stands. A duffel bag over his shoulder, Tony turns out the light in the hotel room. Gs.  Good. And you two leave right now. Ken Taylor nods. Mendez shakes his hand.  The first checkpoint is just to look at your passport.  Your passports came straight from the Canadians, so you're gonna be fine.  The second checkpoint --  The second is immigration. You'll hand them these. They say you landed two days ago.  These guys are bureaucrats left over from the shah. They can't be bothered to second-guess you.  Third checkpoint is the trap.  It's manned by Revolutionaries. Most of them were educated in the U.S. or Europe.  They know how many T's are in Toronto.  You can call our office. Mendez hands Azizi his card. STUDIO SIX FILMS. Kevin Harkins. A 213  phone number.       Wha'd you say to her?  He wants to fire me himself.  If they push it a week, I can bring Ian. That's his winter break.  They're gonna hand me an award, then they're gonna take it back?  I thought we did. O'Donnell claps Tony on the shoulder. Tony walks towards the entrance and Jack heads to his car.     Hi.",

He shakes Tony's hand and they start to walk to Taylor's car.  I was expecting more of a G-Man look.     These are blank, y'know. The stamps?  How long?  And you'll fly out with them? Tony nods. A distant sound of a crowd outside.  There's something you should know. We think one of our housekeepers figured out who they are. We don't know if we can trust her. Now the noise outside is louder. Taylor turns to the window. Tony joins him.  So sooner is better. They stand listening to the demonstration sounds, echoing over the rooftops of the city.  We've got orders to close the embassy and go back. There's nowhere for them to stay.  Pat and I discussed it. If they catch you at the airport, they come here and we go on trial for harboring the enemy. It's a risk we took.  Can you pull this off?  This one. She gives Bob Anders a Canadian maple leaf lapel pin, which he affixes to his shirt. Cora Lijek paints lighter hair dye onto her hair. The Houseguests are making subtle efforts to disguise themselves.   Hello? A cloud comes over Pat as she listens.  No, there's no one like that here. She hangs up the phone fast, as if it were hot to the touch.  They drew you out there to take your picture.     Kevin.           If we tell them, they'll panic. It's better if you just don't show.  It was always a fucked mission. You came closer than anybody else. Kathy and Cora are cracking each other up. No one sees Mendez take a bottle of Macallan from the table and put it in his bag.

    "description": "After Iranian militants stormed and took control of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 taking 56 Americans as hostages, six Americans managed to get away and took refuge in the home of Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor. After two months of the Canadians putting their lives on the line everyday, the CIA and the US State Department try to come up with a plan to get their people out. Tony Mendez is an \"ex filtration\" specialist who proposes that they pose as a Canadian film crew scouting locations for a science fiction movie called Argo. Using Hollywood connections, Mendez creates a back story for the movie - ads in Variety, casting calls, inviting he media to a production launch - and then heads off to Iran to lead the six Americans out.—garykmcd",
