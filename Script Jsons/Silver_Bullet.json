        "Nan": "All right. Stay close. And make sure your brother's all right.  As JANE gets up, the applause starts to fade a bit.  NOTE: JANE is wearing a silver crucifix, and will continue to wear it through the whole movie.      I want you two to bury the hatchet. You're being very silly, Jane.   I think you're being mean as well as silly. Your brother has never had a scraped knee in his whole life.  Well, here it is - the chief source of JANE'S animus against her brother and the source of most of the tension in the COSLAW family.  MARTY winces and turns away a little, embarrassed - this always happens. He doesn't like it, but he doesn't know how to make his parents - his mother in particular - quit it.   Jane Coslaw!   You're not going to vomit, Jane. And I think we've all had quite enough of this horror-movie talk.     She's wiping her hands with a dishtowel and looks like she just bit into a lemon.    Come on, Marty- bedtime.  She starts to wheel him away.   Make it quick.  UNCLE AL lays down his hand.   That's enough!    UNCLE AL is clearing up in a kind of drunken stupor- and I mean he is really drunk. He's smoking one cigarette; another is smoldering away in the heaping ashtray. He drops a pile of baseball cards on the floor and bonks his head on the table bending down to pick them up.   I don't want you drinking around Marty. That's too much. If you can't stop it, you better stay away.  AL straightens up. There is a sort of command force in this man, and here he is partly able to rise above his abysmal drunkenness so we can see it.   Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.  She leaves the room, almost crying. UNCLE AL looks after her, and then his attention is drawn to the smoldering ashtray. He pours beer over the mess, putting out the fire but creating something that looks even worse. He begins drunkenly picking up again.   Marty?  SOUND of her climbing the stairs.  JANE throws a quick look back over her shoulder and then helps MARTY up in his chair. He helps by pulling on the sink counter. JANE has time to give MARTY one quick look- \"Please don't tell on me,\" it says.  NAN comes in.   Jane, have you been teasing your brother again?   Jane Coslaw!  But JANE stalks off. MARTY is grinning. It was a good put-down.    Stop it, Jane.   So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.   Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-   And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!   You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!   I will- be good, kids.     He's changed. Just this summer. Or something's changed him. Marty, maybe. And the drinking- I think it's almost stopped. Whatever it is, it's wonderful. And they'll be safe with him. I'm sure of it.   If I told him to, he will.",
        "Coslaw": "Traveling along a country road. Headed home.     JANE is lying in bed, her face to the wall. Dim light falls on her unhappy face as the door is opened.    Overhead is the moon, three days past the full.    She's wiping her hands with a dishtowel and looks like she just bit into a lemon.     MARTY is sitting in a stair chair that rises slowly to the second floor. He looks dejected and glum.  SOUND of NAN hectoring her brother AL. I don't think we can make out all of what's going on, but we've all known women like NAN and I think we can fill in the blanks. \"Christian household... you come here drunk and expect... can't even bother to call ahead...\" Etc., etc.  A wheelchair stands on the second-floor landing. This one is no Silver Bullet, only the more humble sort that moves by arm power. When the stair chair clicks to a stop, MARTY hoists himself from it into the wheelchair and rolls down the hall toward the bathroom.  Below, NAN'S rant is still going on.     MARTY, now in pj's, is brushing his teeth.  JANE comes in- she's wearing a nightie.   Hey! That you, Marty?    UNCLE AL'S car turns in and parks.     It's parked across the road from the sign.   Stop it, Jane.    UNCLE AL'S sports car is parked in the driveway. We hear the CLANG of a wrench on the cement inside.     He peeks into the backyard.     MARTY is sitting in the Silver Bullet.  UNCLE AL comes hurrying back from his look-see.    It's about a quarter of a mile away.     The barbecue is over. BOB and JANE are putting lawn chairs on the back porch. MARTY, NAN, and UNCLE AL are all in the f.g.      There's a downspout outside one of the upstairs windows. Now the window goes up and MARTY leans out. He grasps the downspout and begins working his way down. This should not be too hard for us to believe; we've already seen how strong MARTY'S arms are.  His legs dangle limply, but he's doing just fine. When he reaches the bottom of the drainpipe, they simply crumple under him and he uses his arms to pull himself over to the back porch.  MARTY hoists himself over the porch rail. Here, under a tarp, is the Silver Bullet. MARTY pushes the tarp aside and gets in. He uses his hands on the wheels to get over the porch ramp and rolls silently down it. At the bottom he looks up at:     The driveway has a slight downslant, and MARTY coasts easily out to the road. He turns right and begins to roll slowly along the verge of the highway, still using his hands. We can see that the light is still on upstairs. MARTY turns back once to verify this himself, then keeps on going. He's not going to be deprived of his treat.     He powers up it, and along the path to the back. Perhaps he has enough speed to cut the engine and coast.       He's sitting in the \"house\" wheelchair in the living room, holding the phone tensely to his ear as the RINGING SOUND goes on.  A CLICK as the phone is picked up.    His eyes are wide. He's leaning forward in his wheelchair.    MARTY is talking to UNCLE AL. JANE is behind them, knocking croquet balls through the wickets on the back lawn.  MARTY is looking at his Uncle anxiously as JANE strolls over.    UNCLE AL is taking the kids home- THE CAMERA TRACKS the wagon for a moment, and then we are looking up the short lane and into a gravel pit.  THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN, FAST, on the sandy rear wall. We can see one cowboy boot sticking out of a wall of sand. It's bloody and chewed.     The wagon pulls in.     It reads 1:00.  SOUND: The National Anthem.     The WEREWOLF breaks from the woods and runs across the side yard to a line of high bushes that runs along the side of the house .",
        "Bob": "Just pretend you're in your own church askin' for money, father! It'll work fine!  Good-natured laughter greets this.    Stop it or I'll throw the whole bunch of you out!  In this traditional family unit, BOB is the Voice of Authority. They all heed, although the atmosphere remains thundery.    That's where poor old Arnie Westrum pitched his last drunk.  He crosses himself and they all look toward:   EXT.  THE GS&amp;WM RAILROAD TRACKS    They had to pick up what was left of him in a peach basket.   Hey! That you, Marty?   As far as I could tell, it could have come from anywhere.   I dunno-   I ain't scared! Let's go!   No- it's behind us. I told you you couldn't trust-     I can't move. Christ Jesus, I can't move!    Stop it, your mother said.  They've just paused for a quick look at the sign; now BOB pulls out onto the road again and heads toward home.     Mostly eyes.      I can't believe that you'd agree to leave the kids with him. A year ago I would have laughed at the idea. You used to almost breathe fire when Al came in the house.   I know they'll be safe with him... but will he get them both into bed by nine-thirty?    He is also dozing. There are three or four empty beer cans in front of him, and a cigarette with a long ash is smoldering between his fingers. There's a .22 pistol in his lap.",
        "Brady": "Little old blacksnake? Hell, no!  Hands - the rather grimy hands of a boy bent on mischief - grab the blacksnake.     BRADY holds the snake up. Both boys gaze at it with respectful wonder.  NOTE: MARTY is wearing a silver St. Cristopher's medallion, and will through the whole movie.    Again we are fairly tight on the boys - we see them from waist or chest height. BRADY snatches back the snake.   I got an idea.   Jane... Jane...  She looks up. The blacksnake dangles down toward her, almost touching her upturned face.  JANE shrieks and bolts. She gets a little way, trips over her own feet and falls down hard. She's wearing what was a nice jumper and nylons. Now the jumper is torn and the hose shredded at the knees.     He's lying over a limb with the snake in his hand, laughing wildly.      Did wittle Janie make wee-wee in her teddies?     He throws the snake.      Ooooh, naughty!     He swings down and comes over to MARTY.   Really got her goat that time.     Look out! Look out! It's Madman Marty and the Silver Bullet!  TAMMY laughs.   You glad to be back in jail, Marty?   I gotta split - see ya, Marty... Tammy.     They're flying kites on the common. Some distance in the b.g. is the bandstand. MARTY is of course flying his kite as he sits in the Silver Bullet. The boys are having a blast.  THE CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES AWAY from the boys, centers on Owen's Pub across the street, and ZOOMS IN.  In the window is a poster. It reads: $10,000 REWARD FOR   SOUND of panting.  MARTY comes into the frame, pulling himself up by the arms. His arms are very strong, although his legs trail limply behind him . He sits on a branch, untangles the kite and the string, and looks down.     Drop it!  As the kite flutters down, JANE comes biking up.     In a while!  BRADY could give a shit if MARTY'S in trouble. He just waves vaguely. He's into the kite-flying experience, as the folks in Marin County might say.     CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP to the yellow smile-kite in the bluish-purple sky.",
        "Kincaid": "They're flying kites on the common. Some distance in the b.g. is the bandstand. MARTY is of course flying his kite as he sits in the Silver Bullet. The boys are having a blast.  THE CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES AWAY from the boys, centers on Owen's Pub across the street, and ZOOMS IN.  In the window is a poster. It reads: $10,000 REWARD FOR   He clears his throat. This is a mild, timid man- he doesn't like to speak in public, particularly not in a bar, but the imperatives of the situation demand it right now.    As HERB KINCAID approaches.    He sits in the first pew. In his grief he looks dead.    He's looking down at something in his hands. Now he looks up and we see his face has become bestial. His eyes are green. As we look at him, the transformation cotinues. He's turning into a werewolf.",
        "Reverend": "He screams.",
        "Lowe": "For the last ten years...  No amplification. He taps the mike.     He taps the mike again.     A bit flustered, he taps the mike and is rewarded by a BRIEF  For the last ten years, I have had a dream. A dream of a time when modern medical care would come to this small community, which sometimes seems so far from Durham, with her lifesaving hospitals. I hope that this meeting, at which I see so many of my friends gathered, will be the start of making my dream come true.  SOUND: Enthusiastic applause.    $32,000 is a lot of money. But when you think of the lives this unit might save, it seems very inexpensive indeed.  Applause greets this.      An endeavor like this seems to me to be the very definition of community - all of us pulling together as one, farmers and merchants... Protestants and Catholics...      Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon. There will be a requiem mass for Brady Kincaid this Sunday. They did ask me to say a word of comfort to you, if I could.  He looks out at them.      If there is any word of comfort I can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time of the beast always passes.  He is struggling with this, trying dreadfully hard.   If there are times when we feel alone and afraid, only small creatures in the dark, then these are the times when we must turn to one another for our comfort and our hope. To our neighbors. To our community. To our love for each other. I alone cannot ease the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can I ease your pain, nor you ease mine. But if I believe anything it's this: we can comfort each other. We can heal each other. We can go on together.      The Bible tells us not to fear the terror that creepeth by night or that which flieth by noonday, and yet we do... we do. Because there is much we don't know, and we feel very small. But we must not be alone. We must not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is the wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to each other. Join hands in your sorrow and try to remember that the face of the beast always becomes known.  The time of the beast always passes.  Let us pray.    Billy... Billy, this is a bad idea. Joe can...   But-   But can't we do anything?  OWEN KNOPFLER hurries past them; he has a rifle over one shoulder in a sling. In his left hand he carries the peacemaker bat.    He's standing on the curb and watching them leave town in procession, some honking their horns, others yelling cheerfully. The expression on his face is dark and brooding.      Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon. They did ask me to say a word of comfort to you if I could.     He's thrown off his stride. Beginning to sweat. He's like an actor trying to remember his lines.   Uh, if there's any word of comfort I can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time-  He looks down. His eyes widen in fear.     Yes, that's coffins- plural. Where BRADY'S coffin was formerly, there are now six coffins, smothered with flowers.     He is badly scared now; sweat is dripping off him.   The time... the time of the beast always passes. There are answers... ways... ways to... to cope... if we turn to each other...    He's looking down at something in his hands. Now he looks up and we see his face has become bestial. His eyes are green. As we look at him, the transformation cotinues. He's turning into a werewolf.    He staggers back, in terror.   No!     MRS. BOWIE begins bringing in a few more sheaves on the church organ, and the congregation begins to sing.    FATHER LOWE goes stumbling backward, dropping his hymnal. The man is in an extremity of terror.   No! No! No!     Some are tearing their hymnals apart and throwing them at each other. One guy- BILLY McCLAREN, maybe- wings one of them through a stained-glass window. Some of the werewolves- for they are all werewolves now- fight or make love in the aisles. The rest sway back and forth, grinning ferociously, singing.    He looks toward:     He's seen all he can stand. He whirls for the back, where there is a small door. He pulls it open... and a BRADY KINCAID werewolf, half torn apart but still somehow alive (a zombie werewolf, if you can dig it- George Romero would like it, I think) leaps out and seizes LOWE.  BRADY buries his muzzle in LOWE'S NECK.     He sits up into THE CAMERA and SCREAMS. Sweat is running down his face. He stares at us for a moment, his eyes buggy and crazed... and then he closes them. There is an expression of huge relief on his face as he does so.   Let it end, dear Lord. Let it end. Please let it end.    Top of the morning to you, Jane Coslaw!   That's great, Jane... I'll be waiting.    Take your cart around to the garage and unload, Jane! Then bring me your tally sheet!     He crosses to the window over the kitchen sink, the bloody chunk of meat still in his hands, and looks out.     She pushes the cart along a path toward a combination garage and utility shed at the back.     Still watching JANE, he begins to gnaw ravenously at the meat again.    Very good, Jane!  She jumps, and so do we. She turns around and looks up at:     Featuring his eyes- his eye, rather. The left is covered with a black eye-patch.   Good, Jane. Very... very good.  He holds his hand out, and JANE puts the tally sheet in it like one in a dream. She can't take her eyes off that black patch, which tells her everything.      Jane! You're trembling!   Would you like to come in the parlor and lie down for a bit? Or have a cold drink? I have some soda-   I'll give you a ride!  JANE is retreating down the hall toward the front door.    How much does he know? How much has he guessed? Hard to tell from his face, which now seems sinister, with its eye-patch.   Give my best to your brother, Jane.     CAMERA HOLDS ON HIM, standing silent and enigmatic.   Real slow.     He's standing at the window and looking out. The torn-open envelope is on an end table beside him. He's holding the lined sheet of paper in his hand. An expression of bitter hate twists his features, and he slowly crumples the paper in his fist.     Keeps on moving. MR. ASPINALL drives by and waves. LOWE waves back.        Little bastard.     He starts it up.     He bumps up a grassy slope to a tarred road. The last of the other kids are headed back the other way. MARTY is alone.     It turns out of the lane where it was parked and onto the road.     MARTY'S back is to us. The wheelchair draws rapidly closer to THE CAMERA as LOWE bears down on it.     He leans over the wheel, grinning sadistically.   Bastard.        MARTY opens the throttle wide and the Bullet swerves across the road. The coupe's bumper actually clips it on the way by, jolting MARTY and almost overturning the Bullet.  LOWE'S coupe veers over the embankment and partway down into the ditch.      Oh, you bastard!  He floors the engine.     He's in a teeth-grinding fury. He jams the gear-shift lever into reverse and floors the gas pedal again.     It overshoots the right turn MARTY just took, screeches to a halt, backs up, and turns onto the lane.     His face is so full of frustrated hate that it has become the face of a gargoyle.       Marty...  MARTY'S head whips around.     Sensible black Oxfords.   I'm very sorry about this. I don't know if you believe that or not, but it's true. I would never willingly hurt a child. You should have left me alone, Marty.  SOUND of footfalls resumes.      I can't kill myself, Marty. You see, our religion teaches that suicide is the greatest sin a man or a woman can commit. Stella Randolph was going to commit suicide; if she had done so, she would be burning in hell right now. By killing her I took her physical life but saved her life eternal. You see, Marty? You see how all things serve the will and the mind of God? You see, you meddling little shit!  He begins to walk forward again.     He's halfway across the bridge now, walking slowly, not hurrying.   You're going to have a terrible accident, Marty. You're going to fall into the river.  SOUND: TRACTOR ENGINE. LOWE stops, alert to possible danger.     He draws back a little, and his face is sharp with animal cunning- inside his head he's running a four-minute mile. Stay and try to bluff it out, or beat it?",
        "Uncle": "I'll see your Carlton Fiske and raise you a George Brett... a Dave Kingman... and a Rod Carew.     UNCLE AL is the family's sheep of a darker color. He's thirty, good-looking, raffish. He's also drunk. He's got both whiskey and beer. An ashtray beside him overflows with butts.  He and MARTY are playing draw poker for MARTY'S baseball cards. Each has a pile in front of him.  MARTY really loves UNCLE AL... his eyes just glow when he looks at him.   Wait a minute, wait a minute!  He grabs one of MARTY'S cards, looks at it, and tosses it back.   Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!   Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.  He swallows whiskey and chases it with beer.    Let the boy finish the game, Nan.  He means it, drunk or not. She reluctantly rolls MARTY back to the table.   Three kings.   Bullshit luck!    UNCLE AL is clearing up in a kind of drunken stupor- and I mean he is really drunk. He's smoking one cigarette; another is smoldering away in the heaping ashtray. He drops a pile of baseball cards on the floor and bonks his head on the table bending down to pick them up.   I come here because Marty needs a friend.   Another wonderful time at Sister Nan's house! Heeyyy!     As we look at them, from left to right: UNCLE AL, MARTY,   He looks at the kids with deep sympathy and deep love.      You all right, Marty?   There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?   Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.   Huh?   Jesus, Marty! Come off it!     It cruises past Owen's Pub. There are cars parked out front, but there are also lots of pickup trucks.      A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?      Marty, you have to get this idea out of your head. Psychotics are more active when the moon is full, and this guy is a psycho. He's going to turn out to be as human as you or me.  In a manner of speaking. Now let's get you inside.  He opens his door and gets out.    And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.  MARTY hands him a medium-sized carton with the words \"Speed Shop\" printed on it.   It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.   I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.   But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.  He gives MARTY a kiss and smiles at him. MARTY smiles back.   Look at this.  He pulls out a brand-new carburetor- it's a chrome-plated four-barrel.   This is gonna turn your wheelchair into a fucking F-14, Marty-  He looks around quickly, guiltily.   Your mom's not around, is she?   Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.  MARTY does. UNCLE AL slides the carb onto the gasket and starts attaching bolts.   The guy killed your best friend, drove your girl out of town, and stole the second-best holiday in the year. Have I got it right?   Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.   Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.     He peeks into the backyard.     BOB and NAN are fussing over the barbecue. JANE is hitting a badminton birdie.    All is cool, Marty-boy. Go for it.  MARTY pushes the starter. The engine starts at once, but the tone is entirely different. Before, MARTY'S wheelchair was a poppety-popping pussycat. Now the engine rumbles like a hood's street rod idling at a traffic light.  MARTY looks startled.   Gun it.  MARTY guns it. The engine roars.   Jesus! Not too much!   You got a pilot's license, Marty?   We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.  MARTY puts the Bullet in gear and pulls away.     He drinks some beer. He's grinning, happy for MARTY.      The kid's dead meat. What have I done?  Put a rock in it, Marty!     The Silver Bullet comes to a screeching, sluing stop near UNCLE AL. Blue smoke drifts up from the wheels. MARTY guns the engine once and then lets it idle.   You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.   It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.   I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?   Good.    I've got to go, Nan- I had a wonderful time.  He kisses her cheek affectionately, and she smiles at him.   See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.     Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.   You're gonna have the Fourth of July in October, Marty. Just don't blow your head off.  And remember that it isn't just the fireworks. It's because no crazy shithead should be able to stop the good guys, if you can dig that.   Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.   One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?   Save this one for last.  He brings out a short rocket with stubby vanes on the end. A fat fuse sticks out behind the head.   A tracer. You'll like it.   You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.  MARTY motors over to the side of the garage, where there's a line of bushes, and conceals the bag in them. UNCLE AL gets in his car and starts it up. MARTY comes back.   Have a good time, dear boy! And watch out for the werewolves!  He leaves. MARTY sits in his wheelchair, waving.    'Lo? Go away.    Not a really spiffy place- the decor is Early American Alcoholic. There's a mostly unclad lady asleep on one side of the bed. UNCLE AL is sitting on the other in his skivvies, phone to his ear. There are a lot of bottles and heaped ashtrays around, and UNCLE AL has a big old hangover.   You dreamed it, Marty.   There are no such things as werewolves. Please, dear boy, have some pity.  He hangs up and falls back into bed.   Obscene phone caller. Go back to sleep.      Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!   From him I'd expect it. I sometimes think his common sense got paralyzed along with his legs. But you, Jane! You! Little Polly Practical!   Oh, I understand plenty! I understand that my niece and nephew are sending the local Catholic priest little love notes suggesting that he gargle with a broken light bulb or eat a rat-poison omelet!   I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.   What the hell does that matter?   Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!   I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.   You want to know what I think?   Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.   No thank you, Jane. I'm a little old for palying the Hardy Boys Meet the Catholic Werewolf.  JANE stamps her foot, furious with UNCLE AL.   I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.    LESTER LOWE is mowing the lawn, eye-patch and all.      Well... he probably did. I mean, he could make a complaint without taking an ad out in the paper, couldn't he?   Marty, do you see your suspect?      Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.   When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?   Kids!  He walks ahead of them. MARTY bats his eyes sweetly at JANE.  She walks on, miffed. MARTY gooses the Silver Bullet to catch up.    Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.   Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.   After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did. He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.   There's something else.   I probably shouldn't tell you- you're both hysterical on the subject. I'm starting to feel like a guy handing out free Arthur Murray coupons to victims of the dancing sickness.   I went out to that rest area.   No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.   It could have been anything, Marty.   No.  UNCLE AL comes over to JANE'S side of the Silver Bullet. He looks down at:      Lowe's car-?   Jesus.     HALLER is behind his desk, rocked back in his chair, hands laced together behind his head. He's looking at UNCLE AL. There's a silence that draws out for quite some time. In it, UNCLE AL becomes steadily more uncomfortable.   I know. I could have edited out all of the completely crazy stuff, but I thought you deserved to hear it with the bark on.   Let's just say I believe Lester Lowe should be checked out.  HALLER rises.   And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?  MARTY slips off his St. Christopher's medallion and hands it to UNCLE AL.   You're not going to let it go, are you?   Marty, the moon wasn't even full!   Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?   The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.   Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.     All right. I give up. Yes.   If either of you ever tells anyone I even bought a piece of this story, werewolves will be the least of your problems.     MAC comes out of the back with a small inlaid wooden box. He puts it down on the glass counter top.    UNCLE AL picks up the bullet almost reverently, holds it to the light.   It's just a gag, that's all. What would you shoot a silver .22 bullet at, anyway?   -and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!  The station wagon backs farther and NAN leans out again.   We won't!  The station wagon backs out into the road and NAN pops out again.   If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.   Can I tell you kids something?   When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.   Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.  He ushers them inside and closes the door.     He is also dozing. There are three or four empty beer cans in front of him, and a cigarette with a long ash is smoldering between his fingers. There's a .22 pistol in his lap.     UNCLE AL jumps up and cries out as the cigarette burns up to his fingers. The .22 falls onto the rug.  MARTY and JANE also wake up, startled.    I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.   I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.   Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.  JANE gets up and starts toward the stairs.   Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.  MARTY begins to roll the Silver Bullet toward the stairs, where the stair chair awaits. JANE is waiting for him at the living-room doorway. MARTY sees the gun on the floor and stops.    He prickles a bit at the unstated criticism. He bends down and picks up the pistol. He opens the cylinder. Five chambers are empty; in one there's a bright silver circle.     He pushes the cylinder plunger, dropping the silver bullet into his hand.   See, dear boy? Totally unimpaired.  Behind him, the WEREWOLF'S head appears in the window, its green eye flaring.     He jumps up and looks around at the window- at this point AL has the .22 with its cylinder open in one hand and the silver bullet loosely held in the other.  Nothing in the window but darkness. UNCLE AL turns back to the kids.   You see it, Marty!     His shoulders slump a little with relief- now that the scare is over, his relief is tempered with irritation. They're just a couple of hysterical kids after all, and JANE is actually worse than MARTY. Polly Practical indeed!   A very familiar feeling is beginning to creep over me.      I feel like a horse's ass.      Would you kids go to bed? My head's starting to ache.      Jane, it's just a power fai-  He's starting toward her. At that moment most of the wall- not just the window it was looking through before but the whole wall- crashes inward as the WEREWOLF bulls its way through, roaring.  UNCLE AL whirls, raising the pistol automatically to fire- but the cylinder is rolled out and all the chambers are empty. He has time to register surprise before the WEREWOLF smashes him aside.     He goes flying backward. The pistol goes one way, the silver bullet another.    You okay, Janey?     UNCLE AL is bloody and staggering but on his feet. He helps JANE up.    Here's a creature that is mostly FATHER LOWE collapsed in the remains of MARTY'S wheelchair; beyond it, MARTY is lying on the floor. UNCLE AL goes by the corpse. JANE starts by... and LOWE sits bolt upright for a moment, grasping blindly at her.  She shrieks and darts aside. LOWE falls back, now really dead. I think. Until the sequel.     UNCLE AL puts a comforting arm around JANE, who is sobbing again- hell, I'd be sobbing after that last one, myself- and draws her down beside himself and MARTY.   There. I told you there weren't any such things as werewolves.  They smile at each other with love.   If it isn't now, it will be after I pound one of your mother's silver candlesticks through its heart.   Oh yes, Janey. When I believe something, I believe it all the way.  He gets up and leaves.",
        "Red": "A rail-rider comes chugging along the tracks. Aboard is ARNIE WESTRUM, a big man in a strappy T-shirt and chino pants. He is drinking beer.              It's dim and spooky in here. Cracks between the boards of the side walls allow dusty fingers of daylight to shine through. More light rays up from the cracks in the floor. The floorboards are warped and uneven; MARTY'S wheelchair sways drunkenly from side to side. The total inside passage is about seventy feet.  About halfway across, the Silver Bullet coughs its last cough and splutters its last splutter. It rolls along silently, going on its dying momentum.     He draws back a little, and his face is sharp with animal cunning- inside his head he's running a four-minute mile. Stay and try to bluff it out, or beat it?     Empty.    Brooding, shadowy. CAMERA HOLDS AND WE",
        "Milt": "Oh my suds and body, here is the Great American Alcoholic for sure - the rural version. MILT is wearing a suit of pee-stained thermal underwear. He's wearing a baseball cap with the word \"Caterpillar\" on the front and has a bottle of beer in one hand (I'm pretty sure that his beer is Rheingold the dry beer). With his other hand he is busily scratching his crotch.   Tammy, you get on in here and do some dishes!     'Bout time. Why you want to hang around that cripple?   Goddamn cripples always end up on welfare. Ought to electrocute all of 'em. Balance the fucking budget.  Having delivered this pearl of wisdom, MILT goes inside, now scratching his ass. TAMMY pauses a moment and looks toward THE CAMERA, her face troubled and scared.    Give him the airplane! Wring his neck!     He looks up briefly- he's heard something- but the crowd on the TV is loud and the match is reaching its climax.   Give him the sleeper, you fuckin bugwit!     Looks toward the window. He gets up, goes over, and looks out.     He takes a shotgun from the wall, breaks it, and looks inside.   Let's see if you want to come back and break my pots all to shit after I put some rock salt in your asses!    Who's there?     A mouse goes running across the warped boards (which have pulled apart from each other, showing deep cracks between).     He relaxes and starts forward again. We keep expecting it to happen, but it keeps not happening.  Then, as MILT is starting back toward the door, two big, hairy arms come up through the floor- bursting through two of those cracks and shoving the splintered boards upward- and grab MILT'S legs at the knees.    He's now waist deep in the hole in the floor, surrounded by broken, splintered boards.    He is abruptly jerked downward again. He is being eaten from the feet up. As he's jerked down, one of the leaning, splintered boards rams into his chest. MILT collapses over it like an old Roman collapsing on his sword.  A hairy arm reaches up and grabs his neck. MILT is jerked all the way into the hole, board and all.",
        "Sturmfuller": "BRADY and TAMMY are riding bikes. Now there is the SOUND of a gasoline engine, and MARTY catches up. He's got the Silver Bullet's motor running for the first time in the movie. Later on it will sound extremely powerful, like a racing car, but now it just sounds like a big lawnmower engine with a muffler on it. It's pretty cool, though - a bright metallic silver with flame decals on the motor housing. Looks sort of like something Big Daddy Roth might have thought up. On the back is a license plate which says SILVER   They stop at the end.    Oh my suds and body, here is the Great American Alcoholic for sure - the rural version. MILT is wearing a suit of pee-stained thermal underwear. He's wearing a baseball cap with the word \"Caterpillar\" on the front and has a bottle of beer in one hand (I'm pretty sure that his beer is Rheingold the dry beer). With his other hand he is busily scratching his crotch.    We can see the moon in the sky beyond the ruined greenhouse.  THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD the greenhouse. We begin to pick up SOUNDS: RATTLING...RUSTLING...and low animal GRUNTS.     The door at the end SCREECHES OPEN and MILT, still holding the shotgun at port arms, comes cautiously in. This place is really overgrown.  MILT advances slowly into the jungle of plants, and the director will shoot it as he likes to build the suspense. I'm sure that plants brush his face, and a bug or two- maybe even a big plump spider- will land on him.  He hears a SCUTTERING SOUND and whirls.    She sits up in bed.  SOUNDS of ROARS and MILT SCREAMING from the greenhouse.  MRS. STURMFULLER, in a nightgown with her hair done up in rollers, comes into Tammy's room.   Tammy, where's your father?  SOUND: Another SCREAM from the greenhouse.     They are hugging each other, terrified, by the window.     The police cars are now here. There's also a meat wagon. As we watch, a number of cops- JOE HALLER and PETE SYLVESTER are among them- approach the wagon. Many are carrying canvas bags.     He drops the blood stained bag he's carrying, runs to the bushes, and noisily blows his groceries.     As we look at them, from left to right: UNCLE AL, MARTY,   UNCLE AL unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his hip pocket. Engraved on it in Old English letters is the word \"rotgut.\" He spins the cap and takes a quick knock. He pauses and glances at MARTY, who looks deeply stunned.   Won't you try, won't you buy...     They are headed out of town all right, but the thing which perhaps strikes us the most forcibly is how empty this place is now. Main Street looks like a ghost town.",
        "Herb": "He clears his throat. This is a mild, timid man- he doesn't like to speak in public, particularly not in a bar, but the imperatives of the situation demand it right now.   Has anyone in here seen my son Brady?    Brady!  He breaks for the door. ANDY FAIRTON grabs him.   Get out of my way!  He pushes ANDY aside. HERB is out the door, chased by PETE and several of the others.    Is it my boy? Is it Brady?   Brady! Brady!  Disappears into the dark. HALLER looks down at his lap.   Br-  The other men arrive, PETE in the lead. HALLER doesn't look up.   We'll bury his shoes.  Now HALLER gets up and joins the other men.   That's what we'll have to do; we'll bury his shoes. Maybe in a couple of Roi-Tan cigar boxes.    We'll bury his shoes because his feet are still in them and they're the only part of him that makes sense anymore.  HERB laughs harder.   It's gonna be the cheapest funeral this town ever saw!       Yes. Correct. Shut up.  ANDY, surprised and bewildered, does. HERB turns and looks grimly at JOE HALLER, who can barely meet his gaze.   I just came from my boy's funeral.   He was torn apart.  Utter silence in OWEN'S place now. The others are staring, rapt.   Upset, you say. Grief-stricken, you say. Constable, you don't know what those words mean. My son was torn to pieces. To pieces!  HERB turns to the others in the pub. Tears stream down his face.   My son was torn to pieces!  You come in here and talk to these men about private justice. You dare to do that. Constable Haller, why don't you go out to Harmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady and explain to him about private justice. Would you want to do that?  HALLER makes no reply. He looks down at his feet.   No. I thought not.  You folks stay here if you want. I wouldn't ask anyone to do anything that runs counter to his conscience. As for me... I'm going out and hunt up a little private justice.  ANDY FAIRTON has swelled up again. He grins poisonously at the slumped HALLER. He pushes off after HERB KINCAID. Other men start to follow.     He sits in the first pew. In his grief he looks dead.   There is no comfort, Father. Only private justice.    Father-  LOWE looks toward:     He's looking down at something in his hands. Now he looks up and we see his face has become bestial. His eyes are green. As we look at him, the transformation cotinues. He's turning into a werewolf.   It tore out his heart.  And sure enough, HERB KINCAID holds BRADY'S dripping heart up in what were hands but which are now rapidly becoming paws.",
        "Jane": "This place is Tarker's Mills, where I grew up... and this is how it was when I was fourteen - a place where people cared about each other as much as they cared about themselves. This is how my town looked as, all unknowing, it approached the rim of the nightmare. The killing had begun.  SOUND: The HOWL of the WEREWOLF - distant, a bit dreamy.    The killing had begun, but at first no one knew it. Arnie Westrum was a chronic drunk, and what happened seemed like an accident.    The county coroner concluded that Arnie passed out on the tracks. There wasn't enough evidence to conclude anything else.  And suddenly the train comes smashing into the frame, horn blaring. The rail-rider goes flying. ARNIE'S body disappears underneath. We see something flopping and moving under there. It could be a bundle of rags. Could be... but isn't.    I'm going out for a while, 'kay?    She is making her way down the row to the aisle (the people should be seated in folding chairs). She passes a GIRL of about her own age who has overheard NAN'S parting shot.   Marty's a booger.  She reaches the aisle and starts out.      I was almost fifteen that summer. My brother Marty was eleven. Marty and his friend Brady Kincaid were the crosses I had to bear. Brady was actually the worse of the two, but I was rarely disposed to see that. Not when my younger brother was so constantly thrown in my face by my parents.    She is walking slowly toward the picnic area, and is passing under a tree. There's more applause from the tent.    She gets up, looks at her clothes, her bloody knees. She's near tears.     She looks around at him in a fury of embarrassment and something very close to hate.   Look at my knees! Look at my dress! I hate you!     She dodges the snake with a little scream. She's beginning to cry, but she flips BRADY the bird just the same.    Oh, no! You never mean to! I hate you, you booger!  She runs away.     She's walking slowly along, still crying a little. Now she steps behind some bushes, looks around, hikes up the skirt of her jumper, and wriggles out of the wrecked panty hose.    A man who looks like he might be a traveling salesman who has just stepped whole and breathing from a dirty joke about the farmer's daughter comes striding down from the bandstand.  STELLA RANDOLPH, a plump but sweetly pretty girl, comes to the stairs but does not descend them. She is also crying - but these are real tears, folks. STELLA is a human Niagara Falls.    We can hear STELLA sobbing as JANE walks slowly toward the bandstand with her panty hose still balled up in one hand. JANE looks suddenly aware that she's not the only one in this sad world who has troubles. She reaches the foot of the stairs going up to the bandstand and tosses the hose absently in a litter can.  JANE mounts the steps timidly.   Stella? Is that you?    It's Jane, Stella. Jane Coslaw.  STELLA sees it is, and turns away from her, still weeping. JANE stands, uncertain what to do next. After a moment she approaches closer and touches STELLA'S turned back timidly.   What's wrong?   Who's going away?  STELLA turns to her, weeping still and distracted.   Stella, I don't know what-   Did you see my knees?   You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!   Brady's a booger and so are you!   Oh, Daddy! Gross!   If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.    He is in his \"house wheelchair\" - not the Silver Bullet (he was in the Bullet during the Common scene, but we didn't get a very good look at it). He has some stuff on his lap. A box, for sure.    Her eyes are open but she says nothing. Just looks at the wall.    What's the money for?   I don't want your money. You're a booger.   I can get a pair of L'Eggs down at the pharmacy for a dollar forty-nine. Here.  She pushes the rest back to him, then looks at the can. She picks it up, curious.   That drunk!   You booger!  MARTY backs up the wheelchair so he's out of her reach.   Go to hell!     She tries to be angry with him... and cannot (this is a response, we'll find, that both MARTY and his UNCLE AL evoke). She smiles at him a little.    What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?   He's okay, Dad!  She looks around swiftly, then bends down.     One of MARTY'S cheeks is pressed against the floor. His eyes are shut. He's weeping.   Marty, are you all right?   Let me help you up.   Here. Brush them good, Marty. Some of that shit in your head might leak down into your mouth and poison you.   Marty Coslaw, you get down out of that tree!      Supper was an hour ago, Dumbo.   They both are. At me, for not getting you sooner. I ought to let you fall.  But she pushes the chair over and MARTY drops into it. He pushes the starter and the Silver Bullet fires up.     He's looking toward the common, frowning and uncertain.   Come on, Marty.  She starts biking away. MARTY starts after her, pauses, and looks at:    My mother and father- my mother in particular- did not much care for Uncle Al...    ...but when it came to such unpleasant duties as taking Marty to the funeral of his best friend...    ...they didn't at all mind drafting him. As to the sort of comfort Uncle Al may have been able to offer him...  UNCLE AL hands the flask to MARTY. MARTY looks at him questioningly for a moment, and then drinks. MARTY looks at TAMMY, who looks frankly terrible. Her mother is looking away. MARTY nudges her. She looks around at him. He offers her the flask. Her eyes widen.   ...I now believe that was best kept between the two of them...  After a brief moment's consideration, TAMMY takes the flask and has a deep swallow. She hands the flask back to MARTY, who hands it quickly back to UNCLE AL as TAMMY coughs. Her mother looks at her... then at MARTY and UNCLE AL. UNCLE AL smiles sympathetically, hiding the flask with one hand, as if to say, \"Isn't it a terrible thing?\" MRS. STURMFULLER looks distractedly back toward the service.   ...or among the three of them.  UNCLE AL pockets the flask just as the organ stops playing.    Look out, world! Marty the Great didn't get something he wanted!  They are distributed just as they were when they arrived at this same fairgrounds earlier. All of them have ice cream cones; they are coming home from a family outing.   Well, I don't see why everybody just about breaks down and cries whenever he-    JANE sticks her tongue out at him. MARTY looks away.    Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.   Went shopping. Why?   About what?  MARTY looks at her earnestly.   Marty, what is it?     JANE is pushing a supermarket shopping cart with a lot of beer and soda bottles in it. On the side is a sign reading MEDCU BOTTLE AND CAN DRIVE- plus an outline drawing of the Medcu unit.   He told me something that was clearly unbelievable... and yet, somehow I believed most of it. And I understood one thing with total clarity: Marty himself believed it all.  She turns into a yard and pulls her cart up the walk to the door. She mounts the steps and rings the bell.     A sheer curtain at one side of the door is pulled aside and a fearful face- that of MRS. THAYER- looks out. Then we hear bolts being pulled and locks- at least three of them- being unlocked. The lady is taking no chances.   I'm collecting returnable bottles and cans for the Medcu Drive, Missus Thayer- I just wondered if you had any.  Her husband comes up the hall.    What we see mostly are her eyes- bright, inquiring.   Hi, Mr. Thayer.      Thank you.  She starts down the steps and we     Amazing how deserted Tarker's Mills looks. JANE is pushing her cart. Even more bottles in it now.   Uncle Al hadn't believed him, but Uncle Al was thirty-five that summer and I was fourteen... at fourteen you can still believe the unbelievable, although even then that ability is growing rusty, is preparing to squeal to a stop.  She is passing the Holy Family rectory. LESTER LOWE is out front, digging in his flower garden. He is shirtless, back to JANE and to us; his black shirt with the turned-around collar hangs informally on a bush.   Hi, Father Lowe!   I'm going to bring in a monster load of bottles in an hour or so!    She stops at Robertson's Luncheonette, leaves her cart outside, and goes in. THE CAMERA FLOATS TO THE WINDOW; we see JANE explaining about the bottle campaign to BOBBY while a few men seated at the counter listen.     Wide eyes, mostly.     As she turns away, her eyes sweep the men at the counter.     Some of them- PELTZER, VIRGIL CUTTS- are familiar. Others are not. THE CAMERA PANS THEIR FACES CLOSELY, FEATURING   She grabs the handle of the cart again and proceeds down Main Street. She goes into the barber shop.   Marty had seen where the tracer had struck home, he said, and I went out that day doing more than just looking for returnable cans and bottles- I was looking for a man- or woman- with only one eye.    Oh... okay.  But her eyes have fixed on the towel over the face of the man in the other barber chair. She walks over to him.      That you, Mr. Fairton?   Got any bottles, Mr. Fairton?   Oh... okay.  She puts the towel back and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as she returns to the door.   'Bye, Mr. McClaren.    She pushes the shopping cart up to the gate, opens it, and goes up the walk to the foot of LOWE'S porch steps. She leaves it there and climbs to the porch.     The screen door is shut, the inner wooden door open.     Dark and empty. SOUNDS in the kitchen. EATING SOUNDS, maybe- or maybe we can't tell.     She knocks on the screen door.   Father Lowe! I'm ready to turn in my bottles and cans!    Father?     Okay!     She goes down the steps and starts to push the cart around the house.     She pushes the cart along a path toward a combination garage and utility shed at the back.     She opens the door and slowly pushes her cart inside.     This is a creepy little place, now filled with bottles and cans that have been crammed in helter-skelter, every which way. JANE obviously doesn't like it. She begins to unload her cart rapidly, mumbling numbers to herself.    A good-sized mouse comes out from between a pile of stacked bottles and runs across JANE'S shoe.     She utters a litle scream and shrinks back against the wall, bumping it quite hard. Hard enough to knock something off an overhead shelf. It falls into the bottles, SHATTERING several. JANE screams again- not terribly loud- and then slowly bends toward the object and picks it up.  JANE holds it, both puzzled and scared.    Father Lowe?  No answer. After a moment of interior debate, JANE enters the kitchen.     She looks around. No one here. But there is a bloody spot on the counter- LOWE must have set his grisly luncheon down here for a moment. She walks slowly across the kitchen and into the dark hall.   Father Lowe?... I've got my tally sheet...  Farther into the hall. A hand drops onto her shoulder.     I... I don't feel so well, I guess maybe I got too much sun.   No!  That is, I have to get home and help my mom with lunch.   No- she... she was going to meet me at the market. I'll be fine.      I will.  She bolts.     She's changed into shorts and a blouse.   I ran faster than I ever ran in my life- what do you think, dummox? By the time I got back here, I really thought I was going to faint.  What are we going to do, Marty? If we tried to tell anybody- grown-ups, I mean- they'd laugh. What are we going to do?    She has the letter in her hand. She approaches the mailbox, opens the mailbox door, and then glances at the envelope again.     Addressed in pencil, it says: FATHER LESTER LOWE/HOLY FAMILY   She drops the letter in with the air of a girl lighting the fuse on a packet of high explosives. She turns away toward home.     She drops in another letter and walks away.   I mailed another letter for Marty the next day... a third the day after that. Then, on Saturday...    ...we told Uncle Al what we'd been up to.  His reaction was less than serene.      Uncle Al-   You don't understand.   It was not! You want me to show you! Come on! I'm not afraid! I'll show you right now!   If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?   Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?  UNCLE AL stops. He hasn't thought of this. He looks toward:        I don't know exactly what I believe. But I know that what I saw was a baseball bat and not a broomstick. I know there was something strange about the way the house smelled that day. It smelled like an animal's den. And I believe in Marty. I mean- there are times when he makes me so mad I could kill him, but I still believe in him.  You used to believe in him, too, Uncle Al.  UNCLE AL looks momentarily ashamed of himself. Then he throws his hands up in disgust.   Did you talk to the constable?   Shut up, Marty.   What is it?What other thing?     Blue. This blue.    In the made-up stories, the guy who's the werewolf only changes when the moon is full. But maybe he's really that way almost all the time, only as the moon gets fuller...   Here. Take mine, too.   Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.   I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.     Will you?  The St. Cristopher's medal and the crucifix are hanging from the rearview on a fine silver chain. UNCLE AL takes down the medal and looks at it.   All right! Thanks!Thank you, Uncle Al!   Uncle Al's friend Mac was more than a gunsmith; he was, Uncle Al said, an old-world craftsman, a sort of wizard of weapons.  b.) In the gun shop interior, we see UNCLE AL talking to MAC, who really should look like an elderly white wizard- a kind of Gandalf figure. In the b.g. window we see a paper skeleton and paper jack-o'-lanterns: our first clue that All Hallow's Eve is nearing. UNCLE AL is speaking animatedly, using his hands a lot; we don't know exactly what the tale is, but it must be a whopper. In the course of it, he hands the medal and the crucifix to MAC, who tents the silver chains over his fingers and looks at them.   God knows what sort of story my uncle told him, but I think that for men who have been married as often as Uncle Al, invention on short notice becomes something of a specialty.  c.) In his workroom, we see MAC spilling boron over the medal and looking closely at the stain.   The gunsmith confirmed the high-grade silver content of my crucifix and Marty's medallion...  d.) In a dim shot which makes MAC look more like a sorcerer than ever, we see him light an acetylene torch and begin melting the medal and the crucifix in the crucible. THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN as JANE'S contribution and MARTY'S melt together; they are becoming on and indissoluble.   ...melted them down...  e.) We see MAC pouring molten silver into a bullet mold.   ...and molded them into a silver bullet.    By the time Marty's silver bullet was done, it was Halloween... and the full moon had come around again. Earlier that afternoon, my grandfather, who had been dying of cancer for over seven years, finally finished the job.  THE CAMERA PANS DOWN to the COSLAW house. There's a carved jack in the window and a corsage of Indian corn on the door. UNCLE AL'S MG is in the driveway. The COSLAW station wagon is just backing out. UNCLE AL and JANE stand in the doorway; MARTY is slightly behind them in the Silver Bullet.  NAN leans out of the car. She's wearing black, and she has obviously been crying.   'Bye, mom! Bye, dad!We will! 'Bye!  The station wagon accelerates away.   Sure, Uncle Al.    She's mostly asleep in one corner.     UNCLE AL jumps up and cries out as the cigarette burns up to his fingers. The .22 falls onto the rug.  MARTY and JANE also wake up, startled.     UNCLE AL is shaking his burned hand; he picks the cigarette out of his lap and puts it out.   You'll burn yourself up sometime doing that, Uncle Al.   The moon's not down yet...    MARTY, looking toward UNCLE AL, sees nothing. JANE is looking toward the window and she SCREAMS.   It's him! It's the werewolf! I see him!   JANE is crying.     I saw it, Uncle Al! I did!  MARTY rolls a little closer to her and attempts to put a comforting arm around her shoulder.   Don't you touch me, snotbrains!           She makes as if to run one way.     It's only a couple of feet from her now, but again, it is toying with her- it's making this reeeal slow.     As it tenses down to leap at her, UNCLE AL leaps at it and strikes it across the back. It turns, ROARING.  UNCLE AL hits it between the legs.  It BELLOWS and grabs the poker. It bends it and tosses it aside. The glaring, savage expression on its face says that now it will bend UNCLE AL and toss him aside.     She breaks out of the corner and runs across the room toward the door. Most of the way there she trips and falls.     She tosses it awkwardly.      Don't you hurt him! Don't you hurt my brother!  She bites one of the WEREWOLF'S hairy ankles as it passes.     It roars with pain and kicks her aside. Then it looks back into the hall. It is grinning. I believe it is thinking this is going to be better than a Thanksgiving dinner you don't have to pay for.    She lies there, sobbing.    UNCLE AL is bloody and staggering but on his feet. He helps JANE up.   I'm all right... but Marty! Ma-    Here's a creature that is mostly FATHER LOWE collapsed in the remains of MARTY'S wheelchair; beyond it, MARTY is lying on the floor. UNCLE AL goes by the corpse. JANE starts by... and LOWE sits bolt upright for a moment, grasping blindly at her.  She shrieks and darts aside. LOWE falls back, now really dead. I think. Until the sequel.     UNCLE AL puts a comforting arm around JANE, who is sobbing again- hell, I'd be sobbing after that last one, myself- and draws her down beside himself and MARTY.   Are you sure it's dead? Or him? Or whatever it is?   Oh Uncle Al, no!   Are you all right, Marty?   You're a real booger, you know it?   It wasn't always easy for me to answer that... but I could answer it that night, and I find I can say it now that the terrible events of that fall have receded to memories which seem little more than dreams in my mind.      I love you, Marty.    I love you, Marty... good night.  THE CAMERA PANS UP to the full moon.",
        "Marty": "Holy...! Brady, are you sure they're not poisonous?    BRADY holds the snake up. Both boys gaze at it with respectful wonder.  NOTE: MARTY is wearing a silver St. Cristopher's medallion, and will through the whole movie.   Lemme hold him!  BRADY hands it over. As MARTY looks at the snake, BRADY sees:     Again we are fairly tight on the boys - we see them from waist or chest height. BRADY snatches back the snake.   What?  BRADY looks toward JANE. MARTY follows his gaze. His eyes widen.   You wouldn't.  BRADY grins. MARTY assesses the grin.   You would.     The shot's from the chest up. He looks sorry he was a part of this little stunt, as he ought to be.   It was just a blacksnake, Jane-      Stop it, Brady.     He moves toward JANE - there is something queerly unnatural in this movement, and in a moment we'll understand, but for the time being we must be puzzled.   Jane, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. We didn't mean-  He's reached her. JANE is sobbing now, hysterical.    He's in a wheelchair, looking glumly after JANE.   Oh, shut up, Brady. You're warped.    Jane, I-   Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.   Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.    Craning back to look at the spot where ARNIE bit the dust. His face is thoughtful, solemn.    Janey?... Are you awake?  JANE says nothing.     He is in his \"house wheelchair\" - not the Silver Bullet (he was in the Bullet during the Common scene, but we didn't get a very good look at it). He has some stuff on his lap. A box, for sure.   Can I come in?     He rolls across to her bed and puts something on her night table. SOUND of change and a rattle of paper. She rolls over and sees he's put about three bucks on the table. Plus a can of mixed nuts.   A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?   It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.  She looks at him and sees he's sincere - honestly contrite. She softens. There's hope for these two kids yet, maybe.   That's for you, too. Uncle Al gave it to me-   -but I want you to have it.  He gives her a warm, melting smile. When your little brother is being good to you it's time to watch out - but JANE has been lulled. She starts to open it, then looks questioningly at him.   Yeah, go ahead.  She opens it. A long paper snake - the kind with a spring inside it - leaps out. She shrieks.   It really is for your birthday, though - try it on Brady. He'll wet his pants.     I love you, Janey.     He reverses his wheelchair, also smiling a little, and leaves.    Sure - I like school.   That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.    He pops up over the curbing with a bounce. He shoves in the little hand clutch and revs the engine. Va-room!   Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.   Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.   Well... it is his third.      The driveway is blocked off with a sawhorse bearing the stenciled words POLICE INVESTIGATION. The yard is filled with cop cars - HALLER'S constable car, plus a number of state police vehicles. Uniformed men come and go.  We can see a large black wreath on the door.      Yeah... it is a little scary.   Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.  He gets the Silver Bullet moving again, and she has to pedal along to catch up.     They stop at the end.   What?    It stands a bit behind the house itself. A creepy place. Many of the glass panes are broken; some of these - not many - have been blocked with cardboard. The inside is a jungle of plants that have run to riot. In the f.g. is a mucky-looking garden patch where nothing much is growing.     She is quite deeply troubled.   What kind of noises?   Rats...     I'd go out and take a look myself, but I think the Bullet'd get stuck in the garden. It looks sorta greasy.  She smiles at him, bends over, and kisses him on the mouth. MARTY is stunned... but happy.   Sure. No sweat.   Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?   Jeez!     There's a gas gauge here, and the needle is almost on \"E.\"      I'm always doing this! I gotta go, Tammy.    He's buzzing along toward downtown, which is still some distance away - but at least he's made it back to the sidewalk again.   Come on, baby-  He looks down at:     Now the needle is lying all the way over on \"E.\"    Yep. Would you fill it up, please, Mr. Cutts?   Sure!    UNCLE AL is the family's sheep of a darker color. He's thirty, good-looking, raffish. He's also drunk. He's got both whiskey and beer. An ashtray beside him overflows with butts.  He and MARTY are playing draw poker for MARTY'S baseball cards. Each has a pile in front of him.  MARTY really loves UNCLE AL... his eyes just glow when he looks at him.   Okay, okay. I call.  He tosses in three baseball cards.   Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.     Mom-!   I got a straight to the queen!   Aww, Mom-!    Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?   Stop it!  He lunges at her, but JANE steps back easily. MARTY overbalances and falls out of the wheelchair. His toothbrush clatters across the tile.    One of MARTY'S cheeks is pressed against the floor. His eyes are shut. He's weeping.   Yes. Go away.   She wasn't, Mom- I dropped my toothbrush and fell over when I tried to get it. Jane helped pick me up.  He bats his eyes at her.   Jane's wunnnderful.  JANE picks up his toothbrush.    They're flying kites on the common. Some distance in the b.g. is the bandstand. MARTY is of course flying his kite as he sits in the Silver Bullet. The boys are having a blast.  THE CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES AWAY from the boys, centers on Owen's Pub across the street, and ZOOMS IN.  In the window is a poster. It reads: $10,000 REWARD FOR  Here it comes!     He descends, then hangs from the lowest branch.   Push the Bullet over, Jane, okay?      Oh, Jeez! I forgot! Is she mad?   Hey, Brady! You coming?    He's looking toward the common, frowning and uncertain.    As we look at them, from left to right: UNCLE AL, MARTY,   The kids are crying. MARTY puts an arm around TAMMY and she puts her head on his shoulder.     MARTY and TAMMY look at each other miserably. TAMMY begins to cry- for her father as much as for BRADY, one would think- and she and MARTY embrace.      Yeah.   No.   Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?   What if it's some kind of monster?     What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?     Tammy said she'd been hearing noises in that greenhouse. Growling noises, like a big animal. Her father was killed that night.  UNCLE AL looks at him doubtfully for a moment, as if almost believing. Then he shakes his head.    He would like to believe UNCLE AL... but he doesn't.    It's not fair.     JANE sticks her tongue out at him. MARTY looks away.    It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.   Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...   Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.   Don't call me dear boy.   She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.   You got it right, Uncle Al.   What?    MARTY is sitting in the Silver Bullet.  UNCLE AL comes hurrying back from his look-see.   Wow.   Do I need one?    CAMERA TRACKS HIM up the road. He goes slowly at first, but he lets it out a little after a while. He's really moving along- thirty, maybe forty miles an hour. The wind blows the hair off his forehead. He begins to grin. He's enjoying this.     He slows down, turns, stops. He revs the engine. VROOM!   Grinning. Looking at:     It's about a quarter of a mile away.     He winds the engine up and pops the clutch. The Silver Bullet doesn't so much accelerate as blast off. It tilts back on its wheels. MARTY swivels into a position like that of an astronaut on lift-off. The Silver Bullet looks like a motorcycle popping a wheelie. MARTY has a great big grin on his face.     He uses the hand brakes. SOUND of braking and squealing rubber.     The Silver Bullet comes to a screeching, sluing stop near UNCLE AL. Blue smoke drifts up from the wheels. MARTY guns the engine once and then lets it idle.   It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.   I don't get you.   Sure.   Okay.  He and UNCLE AL go around to the driveway. NAN looks at them with troubled love.      Yeah! What is it?  AL unlocks the trunk of his car and brings out a paper shopping bag. He places the bag in MARTY'S lap. MARTY opens the bag, but it's really too dark to see inside. He reaches in and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks- crackers, Roman candles, twizzers, smoke bombs, etc.  An expression of sublime delight fills MARTY'S face as he inventories these goodies.   I can dig it- thank you, Uncle Al! Thank you!   Yeah, I know. It's great!   Yeah... sure.   What is it?   Thanks a million, Uncle Al!    Still a light on up there.      Shit!  Thinks a bit, then starts to hand-roll the Bullet toward:     He decides he's far enough away to be safe. He pushes the starter button. The engine cranks, coughs, and cranks some more. MARTY frowns, and pulls out a wire- a rudimentary choke, I suppose. He pushes the starter button again. It cranks, but doesn't start.  MARTY pushes in the wire, looking concerned now, and tries again. This time, after the engine has cranked over a few times, it starts.   All right!  He puts it in gear and starts off.     What we see is a tiny boy in a tiny wheelchair moving along a dark, empty ribbon of road under a vast dome of stars.  DISTANT SOUND: The Bullet's engine.    Here's one for the good guys!     He's getting ready to light one of the fountains. He pauses and looks toward the cut. He's heard something- but the waterfall muffles it. He lights the fountain's fuse, sets it on the ground, and rolls the Bullet back a few feet.  The fountain bursts into a shower of light.   All right!     He rolls over to the picnic table and gets a Roman candle. He plants the stick in the ground and lights the fuse. The Roman candle shoots into the sky.     He's holding another fountain in one hand and his matches in the other. He's looking toward the cut and the waterfall.   Is someone there?     With a little shrug, he lights the fuse on the fountain and sets it on the ground, as before.     He's checking out the stuff on the table for his next choice when he hears a clear SOUND: A SNAPPING, SPLINTERING BRANCH.      Who's there?     The grove is a darkened shadowland.     He punches the Bullet's starter. The motor cranks and cranks. No go, though. MARTY pulls out the choke wire, alternating terrified stares at the grove of trees with terrified stares at his rudimentary dashboard.     Here it comes, out of the shadows, closing in.     Working that starter for all it's worth... but the motor only cranks. Still no start.     He gives up on the motor. He looks toward the picnic table where the fireworks are. He grabs up the tracer. He gets the matches out of the breast pocket of his p.j.'s and promptly drops them in his lap. He scrabbles for them.     We can't see its face in the dark, but it's closer... much closer.     He tries to hold the tracer and strike a match at the same time. He can't; to do that he'd need at least one more hand. He puts the tube of the tracer between his teeth and tries again.     He strikes the match... too hard! It bends, the neck broken.   Oh, please...     He is in an extremity of terror.     He pulls a fresh match from the book and strikes it. It lights.     He takes the tracer from his mouth and applies the match to the fuse. It splutters alight.     The WEREWOLF is less than twenty feet away. The tracer flares alight and shoots out of MARTY'S hand, leaving a pink-orange trail of smoke behind it. The missile flies at the WEREWOLF's head.     He punches the starter again. The motor cranks.     He wheels the Bullet around and heads for the road, gasping and weeping with fear.     The Bullet is really wheeling. MARTY is panting, out of breath, still deeply frightened.     He powers up it, and along the path to the back. Perhaps he has enough speed to cut the engine and coast.     His bed is by the window. His hands appear on the windowsill, and MARTY pulls himself in. He falls over onto his bed and lies there, spent and exhausted and trembling.     He's sitting in the \"house\" wheelchair in the living room, holding the phone tensely to his ear as the RINGING SOUND goes on.  A CLICK as the phone is picked up.   It's a werewolf! I saw it! Last night-    No! I went out late last night- and-    He's sitting on the Silver Bullet, just looking at the yard. JANE comes out.   Where's Mom?   Jane, I have to talk to you.   I need you to help me. Uncle Al won't believe me, and if you won't help me, I...   His eyes are wide. He's leaning forward in his wheelchair.   Oh, Jeez! What did you do then?     She's changed into shorts and a blouse.   I think I know.     He's sitting at his desk, a pool of light from the lamp focused on the sheet of paper before him. He thinks a moment, then begins to write again.     He studies this for a second, and seems satisfied. He opens a drawer, brings out an envelope, and folds his letter into it.      It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!   Was it a prescription?   It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.   Well... was it a prescription?   What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!   No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.   Never mind, Jane. He'll have gotten rid of it by now anyway.      I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.     Yes, I see him.   I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-         The OUTFIELDER who caught the fly trots past, and glances his way.   No- I guess I'll go home.  I think that here we are seeing a rare moment of depression in MARTY- they can run and play ball. He can't.   Yeah... seeya.  He fires up the Bullet and starts away alone.     He bumps up a grassy slope to a tarred road. The last of the other kids are headed back the other way. MARTY is alone.     MARTY'S back is to us. The wheelchair draws rapidly closer to THE CAMERA as LOWE bears down on it.     He's daydreaming his way along- maybe, inside his head, he's playing center field for the Dodgers.  SOUND: Winding roar of a car engine. MARTY turns around.        MARTY opens the throttle wide and the Bullet swerves across the road. The coupe's bumper actually clips it on the way by, jolting MARTY and almost overturning the Bullet.  LOWE'S coupe veers over the embankment and partway down into the ditch.     He speeds past the coupe, and thumbs his nose.     He hears the GROWLING SOUND of LESTER LOWE'S coupe. He looks behind.     He twists the throttle and the Silver Bullet responds.     The needle is all the way over on \"E.\"     He groans. SOUND of the coupe's engine GROWS LOUDER.      Come on, baby... come on...  His face registers hope as he sees:       He twists the throttle as far as it will turn- he's going for broke. The coupe chases him- and now the Silver Bullet's motor COUGHS.     It's pretty ramshackle. A big orange sign beside it reads:   Drawing closer. We hear the SOUNDS of boards rumbling under the Silver Bullet's tires and the Auger River beneath.     Rolling ever more slowly, the Silver Bullet approaches THE CAMERA... and stops. MARTY is covered with sweat. His hair is in a wild tangle. He's panting. He looks at:     This is an extremely rustic lane. Pretty, but hardly the sort of place in which one would want to find oneself when one has a part-time werewolf and a full-time homicidal maniac close behind.       We see a brilliant square of light. In it stands LOWE'S silhouette. The silhouette begins to move. SOUND of footfalls on the loose floorboards of the covered bridge.     He's nearly paralyzed with terror- even if he wasn't, he wouldn't get far in a powerless Silver Bullet.     He's halfway across the bridge now, walking slowly, not hurrying.      THE TRACTOR SOUND gets louder still, and here comes ELMER ZINNEMAN on a John Deere. The tractor is hauling a manure spreader which is mostly empty.      Mr. Zinneman! Mr. Zinneman!     ELMER draws the tractor up close to MARTY and swings it around. MARTY looks back at:     Empty.    MARTY looks back at ELMER.   I ran out of gas.   It sure is!  He looks back once more toward:     Brooding, shadowy. CAMERA HOLDS AND WE    I told you!   I told you!   What is it?What other thing?   Uncle Al, if you don't tell me-  He makes strangling gestures.   You found the tracer?   There! You see!   What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?    Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!   I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.   I saw what I saw.   ...the guy gets wolfier.   Jane... you don't have to do that.   Will you marry me, Jane?   No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.   I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.   Will you do it?  UNCLE AL only looks at him, confused and unsure.      Please, Uncle Al.   All right! Thanks!Thank you, Uncle Al!   'Bye, mom! Bye, dad!We will! 'Bye!  The station wagon accelerates away.   Yeah? Really?    He's also dozing.     UNCLE AL jumps up and cries out as the cigarette burns up to his fingers. The .22 falls onto the rug.  MARTY and JANE also wake up, startled.     UNCLE AL is shaking his burned hand; he picks the cigarette out of his lap and puts it out.   But Uncle Al! You said-   What if I say no?   If that'd gone off, it would have been the end of our silver bullet.     MARTY, looking toward UNCLE AL, sees nothing. JANE is looking toward the window and she SCREAMS.     I was looking at you...     JANE is crying.   What's that, Uncle Al?      Jane-    It's here! It's outside!      Get the gun!  He uses his hands to propel the ungainly Silver Bullet into the hall.     The silver bullet rolls slowly toward the heating vent. In the b.g. we see a frantic MARTY in his wheelchair.  He heaves himself out of it and falls full-length, grabbing.  His fingers touch the bullet, but that's all. It falls in the heating vent.     He's lying full-length. He's got the heater vent's grille off. One arm is down inside.   Janey! The gun! THE GUN!     The gun slides into his hand. Now he reaches into the heating duct again...     He's reaching desperately into the duct and staring at the approaching WEREWOLF.     He rolls over on his back and sticks the silver bullet blindly into one chamber of the cylinder and slams the cylinder closed.     He points the gun and pulls the trigger. There's only a click. An expression of dismay on his face.     He drags himself so he's half propped against the hall wall. He pulls the trigger again. Click! Dismay becomes fear.     Holding the gun in both hands now, he pulls the trigger a third time. Click!  The WEREWOLF'S shadow falls over him.     Craning back as if to drive himself into the wall, he pulls the trigger again.      I'm all right. He's dead.     UNCLE AL puts a comforting arm around JANE, who is sobbing again- hell, I'd be sobbing after that last one, myself- and draws her down beside himself and MARTY.   All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.   I love you, Jane.",
        "Mrs.": "Tammy, where's your father?  SOUND: Another SCREAM from the greenhouse.     They are hugging each other, terrified, by the window.     As we look at them, from left to right: UNCLE AL, MARTY,   UNCLE AL unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his hip pocket. Engraved on it in Old English letters is the word \"rotgut.\" He spins the cap and takes a quick knock. He pauses and glances at MARTY, who looks deeply stunned.    She grins ferociously up at him, playing the Rheingold jingle on the pipe organ with her claws. Now blood begins to bubble up between the keys.   Won't you try, won't you buy...    Jane?   Jane Coslaw.      Bring your cart around to the back, Jane- we'll look in the garage.",
        "Tammy": "You booger.    He pops up over the curbing with a bounce. He shoves in the little hand clutch and revs the engine. Va-room!   What's that?   For getting a divorce?    The other kids are gone; they are alone. The sidewalk has ended and they roll slowly along the dirt verge of the road. They look toward:     The driveway is blocked off with a sawhorse bearing the stenciled words POLICE INVESTIGATION. The yard is filled with cop cars - HALLER'S constable car, plus a number of state police vehicles. Uniformed men come and go.  We can see a large black wreath on the door.      Thanks for coming with me, Marty- I was scared to go past her house by myself.   I mean, I saw her. All the time.  TAMMY stops her bike. She's on the verge of tears.   I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...    They stop at the end.   There's something else scary.   That.     It stands a bit behind the house itself. A creepy place. Many of the glass panes are broken; some of these - not many - have been blocked with cardboard. The inside is a jungle of plants that have run to riot. In the f.g. is a mucky-looking garden patch where nothing much is growing.     She is quite deeply troubled.   I've been hearing noises in there.   Rattling. Rustling.   And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-    I've got to go.      You would, wouldn't you?   Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.   Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?       Coming Daddy!  Bye... thanks again for coming home with me.  She waves and goes biking down the driveway as MARTY motors back onto the street and turns toward town.     She brings her bike to a stop by her father.   I like him.       She's deeply asleep.     She sits up in bed.  SOUNDS of ROARS and MILT SCREAMING from the greenhouse.  MRS. STURMFULLER, in a nightgown with her hair done up in rollers, comes into Tammy's room.    SOUNDS of SNARLS, GROWLS, GRUNTS.     They are hugging each other, terrified, by the window.     As we look at them, from left to right: UNCLE AL, MARTY,   UNCLE AL unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his hip pocket. Engraved on it in Old English letters is the word \"rotgut.\" He spins the cap and takes a quick knock. He pauses and glances at MARTY, who looks deeply stunned.    The kids are crying. MARTY puts an arm around TAMMY and she puts her head on his shoulder.",
        "Andy": "Law around here don't need much confusing.  PETE looks around at this. Being the deputy constable and ineffectual by nature, he's pretty sensitive.   Joe Haller couldn't find his own ass if someone rammed it full of radium and gave him a Geiger counter.   Could be I know a fat old fella who ought to take care of his mouth before someone comes along and turns it inside out. I pay Joe Haller's salary to keep the people in this town safe, and he ain't doing it.   INT.  BILLY McCLAREN, AT THE BAR  He's looking toward the table where the Fairton group sits.   What are you, trying to be smart?  OWEN KNOPFLER comes over.   Bring me a Schlitz.    This whole investigation has been as efficient as a Polish fire drill! It-   What did you say?    What the fuck is going on h-  SOUND: HERB SCREAMS. A pause. HERB screams again. The men flinch back. HALLER doesn't look up. Now, from the darkness on the bandstand, HERB begins to LAUGH. The men shrink back further, looking more uneasy than ever.   Okay, you all know what group you're in and what area you'll be covering, right?   Groups one through four are in the woods north of the Sturmfuller place. Five and six west of Carson Creek.  The door at the back opens; HALLER and PETE come in. JOE HALLER is in extremely bad shape. He hasn't come back much from the murder of BRADY. I believe he is having some sort of spiritual crisis, and while it is not our purpose to explore what it might be- this is, after all, a horror movie and not a John Cassavetes film- we can see that it has seriously weakened his authority.   Moonrise at 8:52 p.m.  Some nervous laughter greets this. Meanwhile, HALLER and PETE are working their way to the front, where they end up next to a grim-faced HERB KINCAID.   If he comes out to stroll in the moonlight tonight, we're going to get the sorry sucker.      Just remember, it's the psycho we want, not each other. So look before you-      That's right, Joe- the only deputy you got is that fat shitbag beside you, and neither one of you has done a damn thing about solving this case.  There is a mutter of agreement.     ANDY hops off the bar to face HALLER directly. In the b.g. we see HERB KINCAID (KINCAID, by the way, should be wearing a black armband- he's come directly from his son's funeral).   You couldn't catch a cold.  HALLER looks at him for a moment, then turns to look at the crowd. They look rather like a lynch mob; on their faces we see an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination. HALLER speaks with a kind of haggard, fading desperation.   Don't let this guy scare you! What's he done since this thing started but hang his face out?  It's not working. Many of the men look disgusted with both ANDY and themselves.   He ain't got so much as a fingerprint!   Don't tell me to-  HERB KINCAID steps forward.   Well, it's about frigging time! They'll have his hide tacked to somebody's barn door before we get out there!  They pile into the car, ANDY behind the wheel. He throws it into gear and backs out onto Main Street.     ANDY, BILLY McCLAREN, BOBBY ROBERTSON, OWEN KNOPFLER, and MAGGIE ANDREWS have been joined by two other men- MR. ASPINALL and EDGAR ROUNDS.  They have drawn close together, listening as the HOWL FADES. We can tell by their uneasy faces that some of the joy has gone out of the evening.  They are standing on one side of a ravine. The bottom is filled with a still ground mist. A few bushes poke out of it. There are woods on the far side.   It came from over there.   We'll spread out in a skirmish line. If the bastard tries to go around us, we'll hear him.   Okay. Spread out on me. Five feet apart.     Reading from right to left: OWEN KNOPFLER (his gun is still over his shoulder; it is the peacemaker baseball bat he is holding), BOBBY ROBERTSON, ASPINALL, ANDY FAIRTON, BILLY McCLAREN, EDGAR ROUNDS and MAGGIE ANDREWS.  They come slowly down toward THE CAMERA, alert and ready for anything- at least, they think so.     They reach the bottom of the ravine and begin to make their way across it. The mist is waist to chest deep. They push toward the other side. Now they are about halfway.   What are you-  ASPINALL is looking around, his eyes widening with fear.    They panic and break for it- MAGGIE, BILLY, and ANDY for one side, BOBBY and OWEN for the other.      I don't want to look at it.  He runs, while MAGGIE stares, mesmerized, at:    No- it's Ronald McDonald. I came in for a shave and a burger.  The men laugh. JANE smiles politely. And pulls the hot towel away from his eyes. His two eyes.   No!   Jesus!  JANE goes out.",
        "Fairton": "Law around here don't need much confusing.  PETE looks around at this. Being the deputy constable and ineffectual by nature, he's pretty sensitive.        PETE is standing in front of ANDY, fists balled up, fat face trembling with determination.   Okay, you all know what group you're in and what area you'll be covering, right?

        "Owen": "At a f.g. table: VIRGIL CUTTS, BOBBY ROBERTSON, ELMER ZINNEMAN, and his brother PORTER ZINNEMAN. Behind them, at the bar, we see PETE SYLVESTER having a beer with BILLY McCLAREN. As we look around the bar, we will also see FATHER LESTER LOWE, sitting at an unobtrusive corner table, nursing a beer and listening closely to the conversation.   You guys turn down the thermostat or I'm gonna turn you all out. Now who's drinking?    The former patrons are still here, with the exceptions of LOWE, BILLY McCLAREN, and BOBBY ROBERTSON. Many others have appeared; this is Happy Hour. Among them we see MR. ASPINALL, the principal, and PELTZER, the druggist. A barmaid, NORMA, circulates with drinks and beers.  Speaking of beer, ANDY FAIRTON has gotten through a fair amount of Schlitz. It hasn't mellowed him, however; he's more belligerent than ever.    It opens and a man in a business suit- HERB KINCAID- comes in. He is carrying a briefcase and he looks worried.      Jesus wept.  He reaches under the bar and comes out with a baseball bat. Burned into the side of the bat, so it reads vertically toward the handle, is the word \"peacemaker.\" OWEN hurries around the bar with it.     All conversation has stopped. All have turned toward the door and the windows; all hear the HOWL. Deep fright overlies each face.  NORMA drops her tray. Glasses and bottles shatter.        Ah, shut up, Andy.    Men are streaming out, getting into station wagons and pickup trucks. Engines roar into life. They begin backing out even as more men come out of the pub. We even hear some high-spirited yells; they are on their way and their blood is up.     LESTER LOWE, looking more distressed than ever, pushes his way through the men toward the door, and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS. He grabs BILLY McCLAREN.    More cars and trucks pull away. There's a big old Ford \"woody\" wagon still there, with ANDY FAIRTON standing impatiently by the driver's side door. BILLY McCLAREN and BOBBY ROBERTSON are with him, and a big, solid-looking woman named MAGGIE ANDREWS.  OWEN comes out and crosses to the woody.   Let off him, Maggie. I'm scared, too.    THE CAMERA IS RUSHING THROUGH THE GROUND MIST- this is like being in an airplane that's skimming the top of a cloud.    He's hit, as an unlucky swimmer might be hit by a shark. He whirls around, raising the peacemaker bat.   Come on, then! You want to rock and roll with me?     For a moment there's nothing- and then the werewolf rises out of it, eyes glaring green, muzzle and pelt slimed with gore.    The WEREWOLF closes in on OWEN, who belts it a good one with the peacemaker. The WEREWOLF swipes at him. OWEN ducks and slams it again. The WEREWOLF roars with anger.   Come on, come on! You want to do the bop? I'll bop you, motherfucker! Come on!  The WEREWOLF dives under the ground mist.  Uncertain, OWEN begins to back up, holding the bat in his hands. OWEN is jerked down into the mist. He SCREAMS. The peacemaker rises out of the ground mist and comes down. Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars in pain. CHOMPING SOUND. OWEN shrieks.   Come on, you bastard!  The peacemaker rises out of the mist again. The hands holding it are bloody. Blood runs down the bat. It descends. Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars again. There is a GURGLING SCREAM from OWEN... and then a curious SPLINTERING SOUND as the WEREWOLF sinks its fangs into the bat.     A CLOSED sign hangs in the door; above it is a big black wreath.",

        "Virgil": "MARTY pulls in. The wheelchair motor starts to pop and lug and misfire. The chair makes it to the first pump on the island closest to the street and then stalls as VIRGIL CUTTS comes over.   Well, Marty! I see you lucked out again!   Want me to check the oil?   Wipe the windshield an check the driver's bullshit level?  MARTY laughs; VIRGIL starts carefully pumping gas into the Silver Bullet's small tank.    But the woman's bed was ripped right down the middle, Elmer- it's take a chainsaw to do something like that!   That could be something to throw off the cops. And it ain't animals that try to confues the law; it's people do that.    Jesus, that was close. Uh, pardon me, Rev'runt.   Rev'runt! What is it?    A medium-sized trap- something in which one might reasonably catch a wild cat or a coydog, let us say- has its rusty teeth sunk deeply into the reverend's ankle.      Sure...okay...  He kneels down.     He muscles the trap open, a little at a time.     Startled and unnerved by the HOWL, the trap slips out of his hands and snaps shut on O'BANION'S mangled ankle again.",

The townspeople believe it's some maniacal killer on the loose whom they intend to hunt down. Marty, a young handicapped boy, believes the killer is no man at all, but a werewolf. After a run-in with the werewolf, Marty and his sister Jane hunt all over town for the man who is the werewolf.—<webmistress@shiversofhorror.com>",
