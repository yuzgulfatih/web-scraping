        "Princess": "She glances at Zed again, but this time a slight smile crosses her lips. Zed grins back at her. The Princess whispers something to her handmaiden Maya and subtly points Zed out to her. Maya nods obediently, glaring at Zed, and starts fanning the princess a little too vigorously.     Do you find me attractive?",
        "Inanna": "I find it hard to eat when so many are hungry.     Yes, I am, mother! Those new linen pants you got me from Egypt make my ass look just huge.  Why not? Everybody else is starving-- present company excluded.     Official White                                                                    74.     Whatever. I'm just so incredibly bored.  Isn't that the idiot who was standing up in the street? Maya sees him, too, and starts fuming. The High Priest continues.  She glances at Zed again, but this time a slight smile crosses her lips. Zed grins back at her. The Princess whispers something to her handmaiden Maya and subtly points Zed out to her. Maya nods obediently, glaring at Zed, and starts fanning the princess a little too vigorously.     Good. See that he's bathed and dressed, then bring him to me. Maya frowns and exits.   This should be amusing.  Come to me. Zed turns and sees the Princess standing on the terrace.  Beautiful, isn't it? You can see Gomorrah just over the hill.     Official White                                   91.  They're called the \"twin cities.\"   And what do you think? Am I evil?   I have body issues.   My eyes are brown.  I don't know. I just find you-- interesting. They say it's the will of the gods that some men should suffer while others rule-- that we're all just victims of our fate. And I believed that until this morning when I saw you standing up, alone, in the square. And I said to myself, finally here's one man who refuses to bow down to anything--  Yes, finally a man who has the courage to question the order of things--- a man chosen by the Gods to do something great.   I know why. To bring you here-- to this place-- to me.  Come. She takes his hand and leads him away. A SHADOWY FIGURE watches them from behind a curtain.  I want you to enter the Holy of Holies.     So they say, but the only one who ever goes in is the High Priest. They say it's instant death for anyone else to enter.     This is what you've been chosen for! To speak to the Gods and plead with them not to destroy the city. Then come back out and tell me what it's like inside.     Official White                                                                        96.  Do you always follow the rules?  Do this for me.     I didn't intend for this to happen.   What now? More virgins to sacrifice?  I'll see you all in Hell.",
        "Prime": "Perhaps it's time for a new High Priest.   Majesty, there's talk of revolution in the streets. Grain and oil are scarce, prices are high, starving peasants are pouring into the city looking for food--  Majesty, with respect, whether he's chosen or not is no longer the issue. To kill him now, given the public mood, could inflame the situation enough to prompt a radical \"regime change,\" if you take my meaning. The King looks grimly at his ministers, all of whom have lean and hungry looks. Princess Inanna smiles contemptuously at him.",
        "Minister": "Perhaps it's time for a new High Priest.   Majesty, there's talk of revolution in the streets.

        "Cain": "You are called suck.   \"God looked on my sacrifice with   You think you're so superior to everyone else.  Really? Let's see how good you are at getting your ass kicked.    No! This smug asshole insulted you and I want him to take it back.   Take it back!     Official White                                                           29.  (turns on him sharply, still holding the bloody  He's all right. Probably just   Yeah.       Maybe I should throw some dirt on him-- keep him warm 'til he wakes up. He starts kicking dirt over Abel's body.   This is bad. This is really bad. We're in serious trouble.   You could've stopped me! There's two of you and only one of me.  You calling me a murderer?   It was an accident!  Right?   Okay-- yeah-- good. But it might be better if we don't mention the \"accident\" to anyone. People might get the wrong idea. Understand?     I think you should come with me.  They're wheels, numbskull. They make the cart roll.  Hail, Father. Cain stops the cart and dismounts with Zed and Oh.  Can these guys stay for supper? (off Adam's questioning   Abel? Haven't seen him. I thought he was with you.  You guys see him? They shake their heads and cough nervously.  I think that was yesterday.  That might've been Boaz---  Hey, we're brothers, we argue sometimes- it's not that big a deal.     Official White                                                           34.     It's been the same damn thing my whole life.  \"Why can't you be more like Abel?\"  \"Oh, your sacrifice was good, too, but Abel's was-- wow!\"   Yeah, hey-- where's everybody going?      I said good luck. I'm really worried about him. He turns aside and makes a goofy sarcastic face for Oh's benefit.  Yeah, I am. I just have to finish toiling over here, then I'm right behind you. Adam and the others hurry off, and as soon as they're gone, Cain rushes over and starts harnessing the oxen to the cart.   Now listen, I'm getting out of here, and you better come with me. I have a feeling they're going to try and blame this whole \"Abel- killing-thing\" on you.  Because when they find him and his head is all bashed in, they're going to start pointing fingers, and you guys are drifters, so they'll put two and two together and that makes-- He stares expectantly at Zed and Oh.  Four! It makes four! Now stop asking so many questions and hop on. We gotta get out of here! He urgently whips the oxen and they climb aboard as the cart lumbers forward.   After him! The farmers shout and race back to the hamlet.   They're gaining on us! Zed and Oh look back.         Wow! What are the odds of that?!  Am I lucky or what? Zed and Oh exchange doubtful looks and glance nervously at the sky.             So what are we lookin' at here? From a distance, Zed and Oh watch them talking, but can't hear what they're saying.   Hey! Come here. I think we worked something out.  Wait! I know these guys!  Brothers!! He embraces them. They look confused and doubtful, but relieved.  You know, you guys are lucky that sergeant is a friend of mine. I let him sodomize me once right after I got here and he's been real nice to me ever since.  wait a second. Do I detect a tone here?   Whoa whoa whoa! Hold a grudge much? That was like a fortnight ago.  Give me a break! I was dealing with the death of a close family member and I needed some space. But now I realize that you guys are like my brothers. And it's so rare to find a brother that you love. Right? He embraces them.        That's the kind of love I'm talkin' about. As they eat hungrily, Zed makes eye contact with a prostitute lounging in a doorway.  You're gonna love Sodom. Trust me. It's crazy. This morning, I almost got a handie behind that pita stand.  Hey, what happens in Sodom, stays in Sodom. He takes a jug of wine from the stall of a WINE MERCHANT. The merchant just bows obsequiously and keeps his mouth shut.  You know, if you guys are staying you should join the guards. The pay's not great, but there's tons of perks. I'm telling you, it's the only way to go. Cain grabs a piece of candy from a SMALL CHILD and stuffs it in his mouth. The child starts crying, Cain kicks her in the ass and she runs away.     Official White                                                                      69.  Come on, I'll introduce you to the captain.  Pretty much. We just look for troublemakers and kick the living shit out of 'em.  If we see a thief or a pickpocket, we just slap him around-- maybe cut off a finger or an ear, or the tip of his nose, lower lip-- anything you can just grab and slice in one fluid motion-- then we take our share of the loot and let him go. Mostly what we worry about are activist types, rabble rousers, getting people all riled up against the King or the Temple Priests. That's death for sure.  Harsh times, brother. We're in the middle of a famine. People are starving. If we don't get some rain soon, it could get ugly.  Then we'll get to start kicking ass big time. He stops to flog a BEGGAR with his hand out.  Beat it, you filthy beggar!  Yeah, well, just remember, it's the palace that pays you, not the people.     Official White                                                             71. Suddenly, they hear a regal fanfare of approaching trumpets and turn to look. At the sound of the trumpets EVERYONE IN THE CROWDED SQUARE falls to the ground and prostrates himself. Cain pulls Oh to the ground but Zed is left standing there oblivious as the ROYAL ENTOURAGE approaches. Oh taps on Zed's leg trying to get his attention, but Zed just ignores it, too transfixed to notice that he's the only one standing. EIGHT STRONG MALE SLAVES enter the square carrying an ornately decorated litter shaded with a silk canopy. On it is the PRINCESS INANNA, a stunning young woman, richly dressed and bejeweled, with exotic eyes and luscious red lips. A HANDMAIDEN rides along fanning her with a big ostrich plume fan. Zed sees the Princess and is instantly taken with her beauty. Princess Inanna glances his way and can't help but notice he's the only person in the square still standing. She gives him a quizzical smile, then turns away imperiously. As the litter passes, her handmaiden continues to stare at Zed. He doesn't recognize her, but we do. It's Maya, now elaborately costumed and made-up. Zed gawks at the Princess, then suddenly a ROYAL GUARD knocks him to the ground and stands on his neck as the rest of the entourage passes.  The Princess Inanna. She's totally hot, but don't even think about it.     Official White                                                                                       72.  Because she's royalty and you're scum? The entire crowd starts moving in the same direction as the royal entourage.  To the temple. Let's go.  You have to see this.  Everybody will be there.     It's pretty self-explanatory.   Her wish is my command.  The three of us are inseparable. We're like brothers. Cain squeezes both their shoulders and gives Maya an artificial smile.     Official White                                                              78. Maya ignores Cain and points to Zed and Oh.     Just like Abel. I oughta just bash your head in--        For the crimes of blasphemy-- (the crowd grumbles its  Shut up! For these and other crimes they may not actually have done yet but we're pretty sure they were thinking about, the prisoners will be stoned to death. The crowd roars as GUARDS stationed around the square pull canvas covers off big baskets of rocks and the people rush to grab stones to throw. Zed and Oh instinctively move closer to each other.   Anything to say before the sentence is carried out?    Okay! Stop! Halt! Hold it! This isn't working.         Him?  He's just a kid!     Official White                                                             104.  All right! All right! We'll try it. Kid! Grab a rock. The boy picks up a good-size rock. Zed turns to Oh.  Okay, everybody on this side now! On the count of three! One-- two--     Official white                                                            105.      At your service, my lady. Anytime, anywhere.         Your Highness, with all due respect, those were \"Woos.\" They love you. They were \"wooing\" you. The King looks doubtfully at the hostile crowd.  Just doing my duty.  Tough guy, huh? You want a piece of me? Get ready to have your head bashed in!     Official White                                                               121. As Cain raises his truncheon, Marlak HEAD-BUTTS him.   Nice move! He passes out and goes down.  (in a high unconvincing woman's voice Peace--- brother. zed does a double take at the voice, shrugs, and walks off with Maya-- as a torrential rain begins to fall.",
        "Oh": "Why did you eat that fruit? It's forbidden. Everybody knows that.  I think, and I could be wrong, that all the poop makes the ground more fertile, which in turn, gives the leaves in the area a softer feel. It's a vicious circle. Oh notices a very pretty young woman, EEMA, standing near the communal fire with TWO HUNTERS. His heart leaps.   Hi, Eema! Eema turns, sees it's him and gives him a perfunctory wave, then turns back to the hunters and says something about Oh that makes them laugh.     Official White                                                            8.  She doesn't even know I exist.  I want to lay with her so badly.  Of course not! She's your sister! It'd be like sleeping with your mother.  My hut's a mess. And what if she struggles?      Okay, I think somebody's had enough.     Official White                                                                               11.  You make babies--  You always get like this when you smoke. Oh takes a big toke on the pipe, chokes, and starts coughing uncontrollably.   No.  There's nothing on the other side of the mountains. Everybody knows that. The world just ends. You'd fall right off the edge.      (tries to cheer him up Will you stop with that crazy talk? We're at a feast. You love feasts. There's women, there's boar meat, there's an assortment of berries-- there's women-- Oh looks over at Eema. Zed picks up on it.  You think? They're playing the Jackal Dance. I don't do that one so well.    (quickly looks up at the  I guess I'm with you.  No, the fire. I lost everything.     Official White                                                                                       21.  Can we talk about this later? Oh pulls Zed to his feet, and they sneak off into the deep woods.     I don't think they'll forget the fire.  If it's that huge how would we carry it back?  Yeah, we'll make everyone watch us eat a squirrel. Will you get real? There's no going back! There's, nothing to go back to! It's just ashes.     What are you doing? Zed makes a minimal gesture with his head. Oh looks up. A COUGAR crouches on a tree limb above them, poised to leap. Oh freezes. They talk like ventriloquists.  Will that work?  What are you going to do?     Yeah, big favor.  Yes, you did! You looked right at me-- twice.     No, arrows. We're going to need them.      Incredible. He takes a step forward, the rock shelf gives way beneath his feet and he falls a great distance, screaming all the way down, bouncing painfully off the big boulders, then a long, tumbling slide over sharp rocks and gravel to the bottom.  I see a pattern. Every time something terrible can happen to me, it does.   You think? There's about a thousand footprints here.     Official White                                                                                                     26. He indicates the heavily trampled forest floor.  No, thank you.   Okay.  Okay! Enough! Can we just go? Maybe we can find where they peed. 14                                                              Then Zed sees light through the trees and creeps   14 stealthily to the tree line. Oh creeps up beside him and they peer through the bushes. THREE COWS are grazing in a green pasture. Beyond it, well- tended fields of growing grain. Zed snaps into stalking mode, ducks down and silently signals Oh to be quiet and stay put.   He's a hunter. I'm more of a \"maker.\" I made this loincloth, I do arrows-- I made a shelf unit for my hut--  Well, it's hard to say-- we just  Shouldn't we do something?   Probably just tuckered out from the fight.  Right! You were holding the rock and he-- accidentally ran into it-- really hard-- with his head.  Oh, yeah, people could so easily misinterpret that.     Official White                                                                      31.   why don't we go with you?  They look really thrilled, wind blowing through their hair, their hands up like roller-coaster riders.     Official White                                                              32.      Nape. Not that I remember. Never seen anybody-- anywhere-- anytime -- ever.  Hey! What about me?  That's really good.     Official White                                                                                   37.  Do I have to?  (trying to change the   Can I have one of those? He reaches for a loaf but the MERCHANT strikes his hand with a cane.  Ow!      Are you all right? Did they-- rape you?  Let me talk to the guy. Maybe I can make a deal with him. You guys wait here. Cain puts his arm around the slave trader's shoulder and walks him away.   What an amazing coincidence-- running into you and Maya and them.     To get laid?  which omnipotent force?  I don't know! What's \"omnipotent\" mean?  Why would he want that?  Why would God choose you? Why wouldn't he choose Marlak? He's stronger.     Official White                                                          45.  You do have a fat face.        They probably don't know how smart you think you are. Finally, a Bedouin SHEIK raises his giraffe-tail fly whisk and waves it at the slave trader.          Hold on! I'm coming! Oh tries to maneuver to Zed, but can't move an inch. OH                                                                                                        (cont'd) If everyone could just move to the right. Please? Thank you in advance for your cooperation.  You can do it, Zed! Use his weight against him!  They lie hidden behind a sandy ridge watching from a short distance.  Their hats? I'm sorry, but when that one guy cut the other guy's head off, my first thought wasn't, \"Gee, what a great hat.\"  How are we going to rescue anybody? They're killers!     Now where do we go? Zed sniffs the air, puts his ear to the ground, and tastes the sand.  trudging across the desert in the blistering heat, growing weaker, stumbling and falling.   Why do I listen to you? Now we're going to starve to death or die of thirst.  You know, I've asked people about that and no one else seems to remember it.   He was a small man. Oh collapses face down in the sand. Pull back to reveal that they are surrounded by hungry jackals, vultures and hyenas.   --mumble mumble mumble loving kindness. Abraham looks at them.  Are they nice?   And where exactly are those cities?  --of his wealthy bounty. Abraham gets a strange faraway look in his eyes.     Official White                                                        60.  Excuse me?                                          I'm not clear--  Couldn't we could just get our ears pierced?  You have any idea where we're going?  The city! He said God's going to smite them with holy fire!  He seemed to know what he was talking about.  Gee, they're not open. We should probably come back later.  Me? Why do I have to knock? What if we're waking somebody up? Let's just get out of here.  Meaner than this? The sentry grabs Oh's nipple and twists. Oh SCREAMS loudly. The guards freeze at the sound of his scream and look nervously to a closed door at one end of the room.     Official White                                                             65.  Don't have to wait 'til morning.  Cain?        We are so in! She's eye-knowing us like crazy.  Well, I kind of have a girlfriend-- not a girlfriend, yet, but a girl I like, so I shouldn't--   Sorry.  You look good, but I think my hat's too big. They notice an OFFICER staring at them.   Do you happen to know where I could get a smaller hat? The officer pops him on the head with a truncheon.  You can't blame people for being hungry.  Gee, I wonder why? The royal guard takes his foot off Zed's neck and they all get back to their feet.  Where's everybody going?  stare at the spectacle.  have no idea what's going on. Zed turns to the GUY NEXT TO  watching curiously.  You throw the virgin in the fire so it'll rain?     Can't I go with him?   Hah! No? That would be weird.         You've been living here since you were nine?  I should look into that. How do you get to be a eunuch?         I'm not supposed to talk. I'm a statue.  How's it going? I just had my whole body painted by a fat guy with no balls, and believe me, he was very thorough, if you know what I mean. How's it going with you?  That sounds nice-- for you.  There's Eema! Eema has been beautifully groomed and is now dressed as a household slave. She stops to serve some rowdy OFFICERS who take the opportunity to tease and fondle her. She tries to pull away but Sargon, the general, grabs her arm.  I haven't joined anything.  Does this look like fun? They both look accusingly at Zed.  What? Like human sacrifice?  Here we go again--  I don't know. So much has happened. Sometimes I think-- She walks away.   I love you.  I'd rather not, if you don't mind. I'm not really a slave. I'm a guard.  Are those my choices?     Official White                                                           89.  How's that?  (splashes a few more drops on him That enough?            No, really! I'm just-- rubbing oil on this man. She exits.     That's so-- unselfish of you.  So where does that hall lead to?  Wow.  So who cleans it?  No, of course not.  Kind of makes you wonder though-- the guys who built it, did they just die the minute they finished, or did the Gods give them a second to get out?  Yeah, that's probably it.  So you're saying we can't go in?       Seize him! The guards arrest Oh as Cain steps up and takes hold of Zed.  What have you done for me? I've been attacked by a cougar, I've fallen down a mountain, I almost had the tip of my thingy cut off, I've been greasing up the High Priest all night, and now I'm hanging upside down in a dungeon. And I have to pee real bad. All because of you. You call yourself a friend? Name one good thing you've done for me.   I really have to pee--           I hate you.    Hey! There's two of us! The crowd cheers and pats the kid on the back.  And his friend! Don't forget his friend! On the balcony, the King and his ministers hastily confer with the High Priest.  Okay, you think that actually makes anybody work harder? It just makes them resent you. Is that what you want?  Can I just ask when lunch is? The whip lashes out again. Oh glowers at him and steps up the pace.  Where're we going?  Is that compulsory? Because I saw one when I first got here and it made me a little sick-- The guard's whip catches him across the back.  Ow! Why don't you try using your words for a change?   See the High Priest? I know him. Dear friend of mine.     We have to do something! Somebody has to stop it.

The other slaves see that and start fighting with their guards, a genuine slave revolt.   Hello, Eema.   Eema, you're my woman! You hear me?  Really? It's okay? He pulls her into an embrace and kisses her hard on the mouth. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Oh sees a guard rushing at him. Oh whirls and falls off the platform, accidentally cutting the guards legs out from under him.  Then how about this? The High Priest turns to Oh. Oh is holding the big sacramental pitcher.  More oil?     Official White                                                             123. He splashes the High Priest with a gallon of oil, soaking him from head to toe. As the oil hits the High Priest, Zed dashes across and snatches Maya from his grasp. The High Priest spins around in a rage, his long robes wrap around his legs hobbling him, he totters on his high platform shoes, loses his balance and gets too close to the idol's fiery mouth. Totally drenched in oil, he bursts into flame like a human torch, screams, and staggers right into the mouth of the furnace.  They look at each other. Someone has to say something. Finally, Zed clears his throat.       Come back to the village sometime. Zed nods, they shake hands, then they embrace. Stifling a tear, Oh breaks away and whips the lead camel.   Hee-ya!  Come on. People are watching. The camel looks at him and slowly lumbers off. Oh sighs gratefully and signals the caravan to follow. As the great caravan moves off, Zed is left standing there with nothing but a long staff, and a bundle on the ground beside him to which is tied his sword, shield and helmet. Maya joins him.",
        "Enmebaragesi": "I'd kill you.  No, I saw you eat the Forbidden Fruit.  Good one, Marlak.  Okay, boys, on the count of three. One-- two-- three! Marlak and Enmebaragesi lunge against the ropes, but Zed makes no effort to pull. They glare at him.  They're bringing out the women.  I see your sister, Eema--  They come running into the battle swinging clubs, randomly bashing heads of soldiers and innocent civilians alike. Cain sees Marlak and stands his ground.",
        "Abraham": "Yes, Isaac. As God has commanded me.     Official White                                                             54.  The Lord will provide the sheep. Abraham takes a cord and starts tying Isaac's hands together.         No, I was going to sacrifice him. There's a difference.  By what right do you interfere? Art thou an angel of the Lord?   Verily, thou wast sent to stay my hand by the Eternal one, blessed be He.   I am Abraham, son of Terah of the house of Nahor.  The tents of my kinsmen lie just beyond. There will you find all that you desire. Come.      My brothers, let us give thanks unto God for staying my hand on the mountain this day.  And for the bounty which He hath bestowed unto us.     Official white                                                         57.  Friends, whence comest thou? Zed and Oh look at each other blankly.     The Lord has cursed them for their abomination.  They bow down before false Gods and worship graven images.     Official White                                                        58.  The men of the city are weak and soft, fat with rich food, intoxicated by strong drink.  Their women are whores; their shameless lust knows no bounds. They flaunt their flesh without shame and any man may have knowledge of them.      Accompany me. Abraham sweeps out of the tent. Zed and Oh jump to their feet and follow. Isaac tags along.     Official white                                                                              59.  Their fate is sealed. But for my faith and devotion, the self-same God has given unto me the whole of this land, from the Jordan to the Negev, from the river of Egypt to the great Euphrates. This did He grant to me and my seed. He raises his arms and spreads them wide.  For eternity.   I and my kinsmen have vanquished our enemies by the mighty hand of the Lord, praised be He. Zed and Oh fake their way through a ritual response.  Therefore, to signify my Covenant with the One True God, on this night will I circumcise the flesh of my foreskin, and of you and every male who dwells hereby.  we will grasp the foreskins of our penises and cut therefrom the extra flesh.  No. So it shall be written, so it shall be done.  Get my big knife. Zed and Oh both reflexively cover their crotches.  Death to the idolators! Abraham's small army of HEBREWS reveal themselves, draw their weapons and attack the reinforcements. The last Hebrew to unrobe is Isaac, who just stands there observing the growing chaos.  What am I? Chopped liver? At the altar, Maya, revived now, embraces Zed.",
        "Maya": "You know what I'd really like?  Some fruit.            Nope.     Why not?     Official white                                                           4.  Why not?  Why not?  So do you always follow the rules?  Okay, fine. We won't. Forget I mentioned it. I understand if you're afraid--  No, really, it's all right. I just thought you might be curious why we can eat everything else that walks, crawls, swims, flies, or grows in the ground, but not that particular fruit. And I thought you might be the kind of man who's willing to take a chance and start thinking for himself, but I guess I was wrong. She glares defiantly at Zed, then starts to walk away. It's not Paradise anymore. Then like every man that ever lived and will ever live, he caves.     Official White                                                             5.  You first.  We both bite at the same time. Zed considers for a long moment then decides.  So you're saying it's not good?   Ooh, banana!   Thank you, Marlak. 4  Zed, just admit it. You're just making it harder on yourself.  Well, after the fire-- (she shoots him an accusing look)) --the hill tribes raided the village. The men fought them but they were too many. They took us captive, marched us to the sea, then traded us to the boat people who brought us here.  Hey!  How do you know God's a \"He?\" Zed rolls his eyes.  You think we've been chosen by God?     For you maybe.  So does everybody else.   The Princess wishes to see you.  Not you. Him.   The two of you follow me.   This is Zaftig the Eunuch. You go with him. Oh is led away by the Eunuch as she takes Zed off in the opposite direction.  As you wish.  Be sure to try the fruit. Zed looks at her and finally recognizes her.  I had no choice. I'm a slave, remember?   Wait here until you're sent for.  Of course not. You were just chosen again. Maybe after you and the Princess get together you can start thinking about someone beside yourself. She walks off before he can answer. Zed shakes his head, looks around the room, then STARTS walking past a row of \"LIVING STATUES,\" semi-nude men and women on pedestals covered head to toe in gold body paint, frozen in heroic postures that show off their beautiful bodies. Zed looks closely at one beautiful nude \"GODDESS\", then furtively reaches out and fondles her breast. The goddess slaps his hand, then resumes her pose.            Forget it. Maya sees A GUARD watching them and reverts to her slave attitude.   The Princess awaits you.     Official White                                                                    88.  Good luck.  She leaves him. A haze of heavily scented incense hangs in the air.  She sees him and starts to revive.  Zed!  You're incredible, you know that?  Where will you go now?  Are you going alone?  I'll get my things. She gestures off and he sees a small train of camels and horses loaded with a ton of her personal possessions.  The Princess gave me a few gifts when she freed us.   That's west.",
        "Isaac": "Hey, Dad? We making a burnt offering?        Okay, if this is because I didn't clean up my tent, you can stop now. I get it. Then Abraham pulls a long slaughtering knife from beneath his robe.    I'm telling mom! The knife flashes in the sun as it descends toward the boy.   He's nuts! I'm telling you-- he's totally lost it.   Best dad in all the land, everyone!        Here we go again--   Okay, what did I tell you-- nuts?   I'm coming with you.  You're going to Sodom, right?

Eema glowers at Zed who feigns innocence.  Excuse me, hunter coming through.  For your information I was in line and I just stepped out to chew some food for an elderly lady. Suddenly a SPEAR is thrust inches from his face, stopping him. It's Marlak, who towers over Zed. His cohort, ENMEBARAGESI, short and stout, stands beside him.  Oh, really? And what if I called Enmebaragesi a liar?  Calm down. I said \"what                                     if\"-- it was a hypothetical. Marlak gets right in Zed's face.   No, you just made it harder on myself!  Okay, fine, you got me. (gingerly moves the spear  Isn't that what we're talking about? Maya rolls her eyes.  Oh, that! Yeah! I did eat the fruit. I was just kidding about humping Maya. Marlak knocks Zed to the ground. The DRUMMING stops. Oh comes running over and gets between Marlak and Zed.  Look, Marlak, this is crazy. You're two of me. I'm not gonna fight you over a girl, okay? Zed starts to walk away but quickly pivots and throws a WILD HAYMAKER at Marlak who easily ducks it, and it hits an unsuspecting Enmebaragesi squarely in the nose. Zed  And let that be a lesson to your big friend- Marlak grabs Zed, lands two solid punches to Zed's mid- section, and then clocks him with a vicious right that sends him sprawling to the ground.  One bite! What's the big deal?  I've always had trouble with the Great Turtle Theory-- too many unexplained gaps.  Really? How screwed? Like I knew it was a rule but I'm a little fuzzy on the exact details.  Where am I supposed to go?         Am I detecting a little jealousy here because I now have the knowledge of good and evil and you don't? Well, you know what? I say what I did was a good thing-- a very very good thing-- and I'm not leaving. What do you think of that? A HUMAN SKULL comes flying in from off-camera and lands at his feet.  Okay, is that supposed to be funny? He stands up and we see that the whole tribe is standing around them in a wide circle. Marlak bangs his spear on the edge of his animal-hide shield, starting a rhythmical beat. The other hunters join in, keeping the beat, staring at Zed with lethal intent  I don't want to seem ungrateful or anything, but you wouldn't happen to have any arrows, would you? An arrow zips in and sticks in the post next to his head.         Yes, or gatherer-- but there's got to be more to life than this--  Kinda hard to concentrate with that rhythmic drumming, fellas. The Hunters keep the insistent beat, their gaze fixed on Zed.  (rolls his eyes; \"these guys are hopeless\" Anyways, I'm going away, not because you're forcing me to-- which you are-- but because I choose to. Yes, I ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil-- major misunderstanding on my part-- and believe me I'm not recommending it unless you're interested in a very powerful laxative-- but it got me thinking about some pretty heavy stuff -- life questions, you know. So I'm out of here, and anyone who wants to join me is welcome. He looks around the circle and sees Maya. She sees Marlak staring at her and averts her eyes.     I don't know where we're going or when we're going to get there, but I will lead the way-- (he picks up a burning  Okay, then I guess I'll just have to go it alone, which is fine with  Oops! They all stare as the fire quickly leaps from roof to roof.  I know there's a lesson in here somewhere. Any thoughts? The villagers scream and run off to try and save their huts. It's chaos.   No, you don't.  How can you see me if I'm not here?  Okay, then tell me this-- who's standing right behind you?  Was it my speech?  But the speech was pretty good, right? I mean, even I was moved and I was the one speaking.  This is nice, out here, the two of us.  Come on, those hunters are idiots. In an hour they'll forget the whole thing.  You know what we should do? You and me should kill the biggest boar ever-- just huge!-- and take it back to the village. Just to show them. And we won't let anyone else eat it. They'll have to watch us eat it.             Oh!  Don't move a muscle.   I don't know. There's two different opinions on this one. Some say run, some say don't.  I'm going to-- RUN! He sprints off and the cougar pounces right on oh.  You really should put some maggots on those scratches. They look pretty deep.  Because I honestly thought he'd go for me. I thought I was doing you a favor. Apparently not appreciated.  You didn't have to come with me, you know. I didn't ask you to come.  Yes, that's a technique of public speaking, but I didn't ask you specifically. You chose to come. You gotta take some responsibility for that. And there's no point coming if you're just gonna keep whining about every little-- cougar that attacks you. (pulls the cooked rodent from the fire You want some or not?     Official White                                                                          24.  You making your own fire?   You're still coming?            Say what you want, but that was no accident. You don't see a pattern here?  Yeah, but why? Why'd the cougar go for you and not me? Why did you fall and I didn't? Hard to believe it's all just random. Think about   People-- more than one-- walking-- that way.   Yes! There! He drops to one knee and examines something in the bushes. Zed They stopped here to poop. Look.  Four men, maybe five. And a child-- or a small women maybe.   Looks like they had some nuts-- dried fruit-- some kind of green leafy vegetable--         We're gonna need some arrowheads. Zed draws his flint knife, then suddenly bursts out of the forest, dashes toward the cow and leaps on its back. Oh comes running up as the cow bucks and sends Zed flying. Lying on the ground, Zed looks up and sees TWO SURPRISED YOUNG FARMERS dressed in simple white woolen tunics staring at him.  (getting painfully to his  What do you guys do?     Okay, boys, that's enough. We just want to--  We're not really that insulted--  Boys, boys! You're brothers! Let's just relax and-- Cain uses the distraction to sneak-punch Abel and the fight is on. They start throwing wild punches, then clinch and wrestle each other to the ground.  Just let them settle it. Cain picks up a good-size rock and strikes Abel on the head with all his might. Abel falls heavily to the ground and lies there, not moving. Cain stands over him, breathing hard.     Nothing! Cain stares at Abel, still inert on the ground.  Hey! What do you mean \"we\"? I don't want to play the blame game, but you're the one who hit him.  We didn't know you were going to kill him--  Did I say that?     Unfortunately we already have dinner plans.  What are the big round things for?   Wow! That is like the greatest invention since the vagina. Cain whips the oxen and they lumber forward. Oh screams as the HEAVY WHEELS ROLL OVER HIS FEET.  They look really thrilled, wind blowing through their hair, their hands up like roller-coaster riders.     Official White                                                              32.     Thanks, but I'm kind of staying away from fruit for the time being. Zed gives Cain a subtle, acquiescent nod as Adam ushers them into his crude dwelling.     Official White 17   Nape. Not that I remember. Never seen anybody-- anywhere-- anytime -- ever.  Yeah, that's got to be pretty vexing. A Bergmanesque gloom fills the hovel as Adam muses sullenly on his sorry circumstances.  Wow. That's kind of a downer isn't it?  Boy, I hope not.  I'm waiting for the punchline.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh looks at Seth.   And that's a good way to be. In fact, I'm kind of surprised a pretty girl like you is sleeping alone anyway. I would've thought guys would be lined up at the door.   Maybe you just haven't met the right one.      I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?  (stares at her for a long  Why would they blame us?  Look at all these people! And this stuff! Oh approaches a bakery stand and stares hungrily at the bread.  Yeah, we're gonna need money.  What's money? They see a crowd at the center of the market gathered around a raised platform. SLAVES IN SHACKLES are lined up on the raised wooden platform while CUSTOMERS examine those waiting to be auctioned. The AUCTIONEER brings up a fnuscular male slave in a loincloth.  It's Marlak! Marlak's hands are bound and he's restrained by a chain attached to a thick leather collar around his neck.   Eema! Maya! The women embrace him with relief and excitement.  What happened? How did you get here?     Official white                                                             42.   Yeah, this one looks pretty good-- He starts prodding, poking and squeezing Maya's arm like he's buying fruit. Oh takes the opportunity to fondle Eema's breasts. She punches him. Zed Ooh, feisty! So how does this work if we want them? The slave trader notes Zed's peasant clothes.     You still think it's all just a coincidence?                                                All of us here right now, at this particular place, at this particular time?  I'm not sure yet, but I'm starting to believe that everything happens for a reason. Like, why did I eat the forbidden fruit?        What do you mean \"which\" omnipotent force? How many omnipotent forces could there be?  Work with me-- I'm just speculating here. Let's call this force \"God\"; and let's say this \"God\" is controlling everything. Maybe God wanted me to have the knowledge of good and evil.  Don't you get what I'm saying? What if we've been chosen?  Well, no offense, but it's possible that I was chosen and you all just happened to be there.  A chosen doesn't need to be strong. I'm big this way.   Not my face, my brain. It's enormous. I'm the smartest guy in the village.  What?!  Which one of us is smarter?  Oh yeah, then why are we free and you're chained up?   Sit tight. I'm going to get you out of here. Do you trust me?  Fair enough. She gives him an encouraging hug, then Zed and Oh cross to Cain and the slave trader.     Official White                                                                                      46.   Good work. What's the deal? The slave owner smiles.  I never trusted that guy.   It's not like I want to be a slave or anything, but this is embarrassing!     Official white                                                                                 47.        That's better.  Look, I want you to know I blame myself for everything that happened.               They lie hidden behind a sandy ridge watching from a short distance.     It wasn't my very first thought, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't up there.  Now we just need to figure out a way to rescue Maya and Eema.        Shit! He leaps to his feet, looks around desperately, and sees nothing but a vast wasteland in every direction.  I have no idea.  trudging across the desert in the blistering heat, growing weaker, stumbling and falling.  Will you stop being so negative? I got your back, man. Who saved you from those lions when you were a baby? They were going to pounce, had you surrounded. Took the mama lion-- BAM!-- kneed her right in the face. Papa lion comes flying at me-- BAM!-- dropped an elbow, knocked his ass out.       Took his legs-- THWOOM!-- tossed him in the river. And the rest just ran off.  Yeah, because nobody else was there. You're lucky I was walking by.  Okay, it's possible I dreamed that-- but who practically raised you after your father was dragged off by those raccoons? Not a dignified death.  We've got to keep moving.  I've got you, buddy-- just like always. He puts Oh over his shoulder and stumbles on.    What are you doing to that kid?  What do you mean, nothing? You were just going to kill him!   Not to him, I'm guessing. Isaac nods gratefully.   What do you think?     I am Zed and this is Oh, sons of-- people you wouldn't know.     Official White                                                                                56.   --mumble mumble mumble loving kindness. Abraham looks at them.  Sodom and Gomorrah? Never been there. But I've heard of them.   i didn't know that. What kind of abomination are we talking about?   Abominable.   Really. Tell me more.   We just want to know so we can avoid them.     Abraham, I'm a little worried about the city being destroyed.     His name is praise and love his whole graciousness--  Excuse me?                                          I'm not clear--     You know, Abe, it's late, and we've all had a lot to drink, and I know this whole foreskin thing sounds like a good idea now, but you may just want to sleep on it. we could always cut 'em off in the morning, but if we do it now, there's just no putting it back on later.  To the city. I have to find Maya.  And you're going to listen to him? You think he's more chosen than me?  Yes, and he also wanted to give his dick a little trim.  You don't even know where we're going.  No. Your dad specifically said Sodom and Gomorrah were evil.  No! I told you, that's not where we're going.  Fine. They stand there for less than a beat.  Okay, you win. Take us to Sodom. Isaac takes a couple of steps to the top of a rise and points off in the distance.  I knew it was right around here.  You shouldn't be smoking either.  Where? Back to the penis-cutter? Besides, Eema and Maya might be in there. You want to get them out before the city's destroyed, don't you? Isaac impatiently grabs a big rock and starts banging on the door.   Get help! Tell your father!   I kinda get why his dad wanted to kill him. The sentries drag them through a small door cut into a corner of the city gates.  We're not really Hebrews-- The guard smacks him in the mouth.  Okay. Lesson learned. No talking.  Hey! Why don't you pick on someone your own size? The sergeant drops Oh and turns to Zed.   Which would be difficult since there are probably very few people around who actually are your size-- He smacks Zed hard on the side of the head.     Official White                                                                                   66.    Right. Enough said. The sergeant rips open Zed's shirt exposing his back, then steps up behind Oh and does the same. A guard hands him a lethal-looking bat studded with sharp spikes.  Cain?  All right, honestly? You did sell us into slavery.  That was way less than a fortnight. Half a fortnight, maybe.     Check out that woman across the street! She's looking at us. The prostitute smiles at them as she sensuously peels a banana, then slides the whole thing unbroken into her mouth.  This is great! How do I look?  So is this it? We just walk around?  What kind of trouble?  Pretty harsh, isn't it?  (on the ground, excitedly to Oh Did you see that girl? I think she liked me! She looked right at me.  Who was she?  Why not?     stare at the spectacle.  Hey, there she is! He starts edging toward the royal pavilion. 45  He makes his way to a position just below the royal pavilion and stares up at the Princess Inanna. She sees him looking at her but pretends not to notice.     Official white                                                           75.  have no idea what's going on. Zed turns to the GUY NEXT TO  What's happening?  watching curiously.  What do they want a virgin for?     Seems like a waste of a perfectly good virgin to me.     Official white                                                             77.     Me? Cool.  We're kind of a package deal. Can he come with?   I'll try to put in a good word for you. Cain fumes as Zed and Oh head off with Maya.  What do you think, ponytail or no ponytail? You know what?       I'll start with the ponytail, see where the night takes me. Maya rolls her eyes and leads Zed to the entrance of the Great Hall. Cain and another guard are posted at the door.  Hey, you made it! What's it like inside?  Look, first of all, we're not actually brothers---  Hey! You didn't let me finish. As soon as I get in there I'm going to talk to somebody and get you invited, okay?  A full-scale ORGY is going on in a magnificent hall. As Maya leads him into the room, Zed pulls his hair out of the ponytail.  Feels like a hair-down kinda scene, don't you think?     Official White                                                          83.  Maya?! What are you doing here?  I was going to rescue you! Really! In fact, we came here to find you.  This wasn't my idea, you know.  Hey! You're a real girl! That is so cool.     Official White                                                             84. He moves down the row of living sculptures, mugging at them, mock humping, and waving his hands in their faces trying to make them move, but they remain frozen.  Amazing! He comes to the LAST STATUE and does a double-take. This one is wearing only a skimpy cloth diaper and is posed like someone waiting for a bus. He is also painted gold, but unlike the others, he has a little potbelly and round shoulders, and can't seem to hold still for very long, shifting his weight uncomfortably and looking around in obvious embarrassment.   Oh? Oh looks down from his pedestal.  Yeah, you look so-- gold. How's it going?  Not bad. Had a little rub and a scrub, now I'm up for some grub.  Hey! You'll never guess who's here- - Maya! She's working here-- and she looks great! But she's kinda mad at me. Oh scans the great hall looking for her and spots Zed's sister Eema, his crush, come into the room carrying a tray of food.     Official White                                                           85.  You! Slave girl! (he pulls her away from  Now go-- fetch! Wait by that-- skinny statue. I'll deal with you later. As Eema exits, Zed turns to the officers and shrugs.  Slaves-- what are you gonna do?  Ouch. Helpful hint. I will keep that in mind.     Official White                                                          86. Zed bows, then leaves him and joins Eema who is waiting at Oh's pedestal. Zed What are you doing here?  Keep that up and you will.  Okay, I know what you're thinking, but I'm just checking it out. We kept hearing that this place was so evil, but now that I look around I'm thinking maybe it's not all bad. There's a lot to learn here.  No! Like the wheel, for instance! That's pretty awesome-- the way it just goes around in a circle. And farming! And metal-- writing, money, pottery-- hot baths. Come on! Back in the village we thought sharpening a stick was a big breakthrough.  Look, I think I've been chosen to do something great with my life--  --and I don't think it's hunting wild pigs and weaving baskets. Maya returns for Zed.  I hope you don't think I'm interested in her.  I'm just using her, Maya! It's part of my plan. I'm going to get you all out of here as soon as I can.   It's a secret.  And I await her.  You two await me. (then confidentially to Eema and Oh Stay out of trouble. I'll be back. He exits with Maya.    I didn't know it was so close.  Looks pretty from up here, but some people think God is going to wipe them out because they're so evil.  I don't really know you. But you don't look evil.  Well, yeah. I think you're-- incredible.  No, you're perfect. Your face, your hair--  Your eyes are like the sea.  Well, it's kinda dark. I took a shot. I know they're big, though-- and wet-- She pulls him close.  Can I ask you one thing? What would a girl like you want with a guy like me?     Official white                                                    92.           What are we doing here?  Yes! Finally. Now you're talking! Should I enter it right here or should we go back to your bedroom? Does the Holy of Holies like to be entered from behind or--?  The Gods are in there?  Then why am I going in?     Right-- right. Then again, if the rules say--  What is it with chicks always wanting guys to break the rules? You-all have this bad boy complex---- She kisses him fiercely on the lips.  I'm going in. He enters the Holy of Holies. A FIGURE darts between the columns and hides in the shadows. A beam of moonlight reveals the mark of Cain on his forehead.  (takes a deep breath and starts improvising Thank you, O-- Merciful ones, for-- not like-- killing me, and letting me receive the, uh, blessing of your holy-- godliness. He exhales and closes his eyes again, waiting for some divine response. Nothing comes.     Official White                                               97.  (props himself up on his  Look, I know you think this place is evil and it kinda is-- I see that-- but that's not everybody. There are a lot of good people, too. So what if there were, like, fifty really good people? Would you still destroy the city?  Okay, you're right, that may be a reach. How about twenty? I could probably get you twenty extremely good people if I really looked around.  How about five? Five awesome people-- including myself. I personally know at least five people worth saving. Does that sound good?      Official White                                                                               98.     Okay, wait. Is that the sign? The silence? Is that it?  It is, isn't it! Just this really silent-- silence.  You're not going to tell me what to do; it's up to me to decide what's right and what's wrong-- right? Is that it? You're not going to speak to me-- you're going to speak through me? If that's right, don't say anything.  Okay, I read you loud and clear. Thank you.  Oh, and if things don't work out with Maya would it be okay with you if me and the Princess had a little \"carnal knowledge\"? Not in an evil way or anything--  Okay! You're right, probably not a good idea. Thank you. He backs out of the Holy of Holies, bowing all the way.  I was just looking for the bathroom.  I wish I was upside down. Looks fun. Oh won't talk to him.  So this is it? We're not friends anymore? After all I've done for you?     Official White                                                           100.  I've helped you come out of your shell.  Listen, I know I'm not perfect, and I may have made a few wrong turns, but you have to understand-- I'm a chosen. That's a lot of responsibility -- you can't even imagine.    That was just my first idea-- and I'm also accepting ideas.  Oh, come on!   I just want to say this is really messed up--  Can I make a suggestion?  Why don't you just pick one person to throw? The crowd thinks that's not a bad idea and murmurs agreement.   In fact, don't you think it would be fair for us to get to pick the person who stones us? Cain looks doubtful, but the crowd thinks this is eminently fair.  We pick him! Cain points at a BIG GUY, heavily muscled, eagerly waving his hand.  No, next to him! He points at a BOY, about nine years old and not very big.  So? You got something against kids? Zed plays the crowd which starts booing in disapproval.  This guy hates kids!  Good thinking, huh? They turn to face the boy, ready to dodge when he throws. The boy winds up and fires a major league fastball that smacks Oh right on the forehead. The crowd cheers.  Holy shit! That kid's got an arm!  Wait! I have a question for the King! The crowd goes silent. All eyes turn and look up to the palace balcony.   Why didn't I die in the Holy of Holies? On the balcony, everyone is totally stopped by his question. One by one they all look to the High Priest who seems to be stumped. In the square, the crowd starts muttering. Zed seizes the initiative.  I entered the Holy of Holies and, lo, I did not die! Why? Because I am chosen by the Gods!   Yes!   Hey! Boys! Long time no see. They glance up, but ignore him.  Don't tell me you're still mad about Maya. That's so over. I have a thing going with the princess now-- well, almost had a thing. I'm a slave now-- just like you.  Okay. We do have our differences-- like about a cup and half of brain tissue-- but that doesn't mean we can't work together. Another GUARD approaches and whacks Marlak with his stick.  You know, I'd like to, but I did something to my neck--  I must've slept on it funny-- those dungeon pillows are like rocks-- well, they are rocks-- so I should probably take it easy or I'll be no damn good for work tomorrow.  Okay! But I should tell you, this isn't really my area. I'm just on a break from the mud department-- The Guard draws his short sword and raises it over Zed.   Okay, okay. I'm going. (to Marlak and  Learned that from Maya. Good trick, huh? Okay, together this time. Go!     Official White                                                                                     109. They pull together and the heavy cart starts to move.  How high you guys think we're going with this?   That's ambitious.     Oh, right, the tower. Incredible erection.   You're from the village, aren't you? The child nods.  I bet you wish you were back there right now, don't you. The child nods again.  Well, don't give up. You're going to get home someday. Marlak kicks Zed from behind, knocking him over.         I have to get down there.  Wow. Who saw that coming? Thanks, Marlak.  (looping the rope around his waist Lower me down. Without waiting for a response, Zed bravely jumps off the top of the ziggurat holding the rope.     Official White                                                                   116. Marlak looks at the rope in his hands, pulls it a little and sees that it's not attached to the rope Zed was holding.  He's descending rapidly, rappelling off the side of the ziggurat. He looks up, expecting Marlak to belay him and slow him down.           I Said, 'I don't think so.'  Whatever that last thing you said was.  Let her go.   Why don't we just sacrifice something small-- a rabbit maybe. Or a duck. That'd be good, don't you think?  They look at each other. Someone has to say something. Finally, Zed clears his throat.  I'm the, uh, Chosen One, I guess, and on behalf of, well, the whole city, I want to thank the High Priest for his incredible sacrifice. That was really something, wasn't it? He starts clapping, then Oh starts clapping, and soon all the people in the square are applauding. At that moment a single drop of rain falls and hits Zed in the eye. He looks up, a few more drops, then a hard steady rain starts to fall. The people all look up in awe, then someone cheers and they all roar in celebration. Then the rain stops as suddenly as it started. The cheers die away, and confused, dissatisfied muttering begins.   People! Friends! Sodomites! Okay, that was a little confusing, wasn't it?       Was that a sign from God? Wasn't it a sign? What's the deal? We all want to know. But I'm not sure anybody really knows-- and I'd be real suspicious of people who say they do. If I've learned one thing, it's this: the world and everything in it is a miracle. And what that miracle means is for each and every one of us to figure out for himself. Are the Gods going to destroy us? Maybe-- I don't know-- I guess it's possible. But if we keep going the way we are, they won't have to. We're doing a pretty good job of destroying ourselves. So maybe we should all just go home now, and think about what happened-- and be very, very good to each other. I know I'm going to try. (raises his hand in salute to the people Peace. The crowd stares at him blankly. Nobody knows what to make of it all. Then Marlak shouts loud enough for all to hear.  That's what I've been trying to tell you. Zed and Maya, Oh and Eema stand there basking in the gratitude of the people as Inanna looks on.   Well said, Marlak. You really have a way with words. They clasp hands.  Not much to tell, is there? Just an average guy who saw his destiny and had the courage to defy a powerful empire. No big deal. Oh is at the front of the caravan, giving orders, but no one is listening to him. Zed joins him.  Everybody ready?     Official White                                                          126.  Might head down to Egypt. I hear it's a happening kinda place.  Not necessarily. You want to come?     Official White                                                             127.  Traveling light, huh? Okay, here we go.  To the west!  I knew that. Just wanted to see if you did. Zed grins and they start walking, passing a small herd of sheep and goats, tended by VEILED WOMEN, going in the opposite direction. As THE LAST OF THE SHEPHERD WOMEN passes, we notice something masculine about her build and posture. Zed nods politely to her, but she averts her eyes and turns away from him.",
        "Eema": "Oh.     I'm sorry! It was an accident.  I'm sorry.  We were sold to the palace. But I won't serve these people! I'd rather die!  What are you doing here?  Have you joined them?   What happened to him?     Official White                                                        87.  He has no idea what he's doing, does he?      Oh? He stares at her full red lips and big blue eyes.  Okay.     Official White                                                                    122.   I'll listen to you. Oh swells up with pride.",
        "King": "The Princess isn't eating?   Your concern is enviable.  Careful, Princess. You may be my step-daughter, but these are dangerous times and those are dangerous words. I weep for the suffering of my people, but the spirit of rebellion is alive in the city and if necessary I will crush it with every means at my disposal.   For the good of everyone who enjoys the favor of the throne.  Six sacrifices in the last ten days and still no rain. What do the entrails predict?     Official White                                                             80.  What does it mean?  What does it mean for us?     Poverty has a bitter taste, but it's the flavor they were born to. It's the will of the Gods. The Queen and Princess Inanna are lounging on cushioned divans, listening.  Observe, my dear. It seems the least you could do, since it was you who lured him to his death. She reluctantly turns and looks at Zed.   What is that idiot doing?  Could it be? Is he truly chosen?  Imbecile!     Official White                                                                            106.  Are they booing me? How dare they!  Yes, two, followers of the Chosen One, discovered by this loyal soldier. Cain bows to the King.  And one more to demonstrate our own faith and charity. The King stands and makes a proclamation loud enough for everyone to hear.  In supplication to the Gods, for the love of the People, we offer a humble sacrifice to the sacred temple fire-- our own step- daughter, the Princess Inanna! The crowd gasps.   For the good of the people.  Wouldn't I? If you like, I could arrange for you to join her. The Queen slowly sits back down.   How long did you think I'd tolerate your insolence?  Burn her.- Sargon and Cain seize Inanna, but she shrugs them off and rises with dignity.  He starts to panic at the full-scale revolt and rises nervously. His ministers surround him, he thinks to protect him.  I knew I could depend on your loyalty. The ministers all draw daggers from their robes and move in for the kill."
