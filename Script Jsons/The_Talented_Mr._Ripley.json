        "Meredith": "What's your secret?  No, it's just - you are American, aren't you? - no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.  I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.  Hello.  You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?  So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just - upstairs - weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.  Which is?  The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.  As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.  Right.       But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?  At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and -  Everybody knows Freddie Miles.  Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.  Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if -  The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do - agreed? - you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.  I've never admitted that to anyone.  Show me the other one again. I like them both.  I know you're a jazz fiend but do you absolutely hate the Opera?  I've been trying to give my tickets away, it's tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be dragged...  I thought you were enjoying yourself?  You're crazy! It's freezing out there.    Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.  No, I absolutely understand. Of course.  Beating you away.     Will you meet me tomorrow?  Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too...you should always save pain for daylight...    Peter? Hello, it's Meredith Logue.  I won't actually, although I think this might - are you waiting for Dickie?  You were at the Opera? Well, that explains - yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.    He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I...I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet - which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?  Ripley? No. I heard about him, of course, but no, I didn't meet him.  Not for me. No, grazie.  I hope I didn't complicate matters, but nothing, nothing untoward happened, nothing to prevent you from welcoming him back, from marrying him...Goodbye. Goodbye Peter, please don't get up.  Dickie?  Dickie?  Dickie, my God!  I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...  What?  Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.  And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.  When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?  You're kidding.  You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.  So - are you travelling under R?  Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley?  I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.",

        "Verrecchia": "Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.  Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? <i>(When was the last time Ripley saw Greenleaf?)</i>  Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?  All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?  Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?      Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private!  <i>(This is not the place for your private conversations)</i>  Hmm. C'e questa...  <i></i>    Of course!",
        "Dickie": "Who's this?  Okay. And did we know each other?     What are you doing in Mongi?    Say again?  That's funny.  Sure.  Any time.  I've been looking for you everywhere.  What?  Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.  I just woke up.  I'm sorry.  Fausto and I - we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.  We?  Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.  Is that good?  Can you mix a martini?  Everybody should have one talent. What's yours?        I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now!  That's brilliant!  How do you know him?  Marge! You've got to hear this!  Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.  Uncanny!  What?  I'm never going back. To actually hire somebody to come all the way here to drag me back home - got to be insane, hasn't he?  I'm never going back!  It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for - ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! - it's got nothing to do with my mother.           You like jazz!    Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat -  <i>Bird!</i>    Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come. It's great.  You're going to love it.         I can't write and I can't spell.  That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.  Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad alone, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge...a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?        It'll just be for a little while.  He can be... he makes me laugh.  You'd say if you mind?  Marge, you like everybody.  Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.     Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast.  It's not love it's the coffee machine.  Shut up.  No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.  I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off - otherwise I'd give it to you.  I hope it wasn't cheap.  You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?  Oh God - I can just imagine - <i>if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild?</i>  Never! I swear on your ring, Marge.  I am never going back.  You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.  Yes please!  Sure.  I love Venice.  See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you?  Okay, Venice is on the list.  Do you ski? Don't tell me - you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent. Marge - Ripley can't ski.  We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?  Okay.  I want to talk to you too...Smile for me.  You're breaking my ribs!  You're breaking my ribs!     I could fuck this icebox I love it so much. What were you actually doing in New York?  That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.  The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating. Cold beer. Thank you Dad.  (staring to write on the back  She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient.  Without the glasses you're not even ugly. I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.  I know. I write like a child.  It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.       Do you have any brothers?  me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children - what does that mean?  No!    It is me. It's an old picture. Every time - 'is it you?  Doesn't look like you'.  What does he say?  You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.  I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something.  Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.  Andiamo a Roma.  We're taking Tom to Roma!  Relax.  Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.  Freddie Miles.  You know - he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.  Frederico!  This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.  I'll tell you - I am so cabin-crazy with Mongi.  Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is - if you want to be a tourist - grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.  Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?    Ciao.  Have fun.     What are you doing?  I wish you'd get out of my clothes.  Shoes too?  Get undressed in your own room, would you?  Freddie drove me back in his car.  He's downstairs.       Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back?  At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.  Do you think you can steer this thing?  Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.  Marge-maintenance.           I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.     What about us?      What are you talking about?  She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.  You can't blame him.  You could hardly expect this to go on forever.  I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?  I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money.  It's time we all moved on.  Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything - I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me.  Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival - we could say goodbye in style.  What do you think? A last trip?    This is more like it. Didn't I tell you San Remo was crazy!  To Mongi.  You're cheerful tonight.  That's good.  Ripley's plans.  Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?  No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?  I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.  I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!  Do you even like jazz - or was that something for my benefit?  I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?  So cool.  That's how I found my place in Mongi. Took a boat out round the bay.  The first place I liked, I got it.    So tell me.    Oh God, I don't think so.  Marge and I are getting married.  How?  I love Marge.    I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.  You can be a leech - you know this - and it's boring. You can be quite boring.    (attacking him, administering    For God's sake.  I'll kill you!",
        "Greenleaf": "Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.  (pointing at Ripley's borrowed  We couldn't help noticing your jacket.  Yes.  Class of '56?    Both of you...  Of course, Dickie's idea of music is Jazz. He has a saxophone.  To my ear Jazz is just noise, just an insolent noise.  Darling couple, aren't they?  Yes.  An exceptional young man.     Mongibello. Tiny place. South of Naples. Marge, his uh, the young lade is supposedly writing some kind of book. God knows what he does. By all accounts they spend the whole time on the beach. Or his sailboat. That's my son's talent, spending his allowance.  Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home? I'd pay you.  I'd pay you 1000 dollars.  Good.

The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?  He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.  This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something...to himself.  You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone - perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow -  What a waste of lives and opportunities and -      And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that - can you imagine - the frame of mind you'd have to be in? <i>I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.</i>          Tom.  Marge has been telling us about the rings.  Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.

        "Marge": "How do you do.  You should come and have lunch with us, before you go - Dickie?  And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.     Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.  You just woke up!  Well, we ate everything without you.  Yes, Tom Ripley's here.  Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.  Shut up!      What's going on?  I don't get it.  Hi Tom.  I'll come down.    I never said that!  Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.  It's vile.  Dickie, you can't even drive a car!  No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.  Okay, darling.  No, I like him.  I don't like you.  It's the one task Dickie can do on his own - make coffee.  Oh darling - is that for me?         Oh, it was.  Frances?  Dubious but special honor, Tom - crewing Dickie's boat.  Alright, bar's open.  Poor Tom. Good thing we're not getting married. We might have to invite him on our honeymoon.  Oh I hated New York - that Park Avenue crowd - so I fled to Paris to work on my book, and I was always going to this cafe with Jean-Jacques, and Dickie used to play his saxophone outside and I would see him and he would see me, and he would play <i>My Funny Valentine.</i> It was only later that I realised he only knows about six songs.    <i>Si.  Come sempre.  Grazie.</i>    If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.     Hi, Tom.  Come join us.  You really should go in, it's marvellous.  Are you okay?  The thing with Dickie - it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.  He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...  It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life - Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley - he's wonderful - did you meet him, he's a musician? - ... and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.  Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.  Didn't Dick say? - he talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out - Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.    Dickie!  I'll go.     Tom, you startled me!  You're back.  Yes - I'm on a good streak, thanks.  Where's Dickie?    What does that mean?  Is that what he said - he wanted to be alone?  Thanks. he knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...    There was a letter from Dickie in with my perfume. You realize it's more than a few days? He's thinking of moving to Rome.  The thing is, the night before he left, we talked about moving, together, going North - and I suppose I put some pressure on him, about getting married, I just might have scared him off. There's a side to him, when our heads are on the pillow, I know no-one else sees it, which is really tender. I think I should come with you to Rome and just confront him.  He hates being confronted.    Is he here? Are you with Dickie?    Is he really not here?  You were going to Venice.  I don't know her. He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.  Hello.  (stunned at the mention of his      Do you know Tom?  Dickie was at the Opera last night.  He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him - that's not fair.  I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home. I'm going to go home.  I hope so.  Did he kill Freddie?  Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?  I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you. What happened to your face?    What?  Where does Dickie live?  Perhaps I shouldn't go either.  Dick? Dickie? I know you can hear me. What am I doing, chasing you around...? I was going to say I would count to three and if you didn't open the door, but I won't count any more. On you. I won't count on you any more. Whatever it is, whatever you've done or haven't done, you've broken my heart. That's one thing I know you're guilty of, and I don't know why, I don't know why, I just don't know why...      So you found Peter...  He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach - I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.  Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now - a Mr MacCarron - Dickie's father's employing him.  He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.  Is that what you do before you jump in the Tiber?  I don't think so.    Golly. Who's paying for this?  This is spectacular.  A hotel would've been fine. We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.  No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi. And now look at you.  To the manner born.  Very.  Where's Mr MacCarron?  I just don't believe that!  Such as?  Did Dickie's Dad go?  Poor man. We were knocking on that door for ever. I think I've broken my strap.  You <i>walk</i> in Venice!  Tom?  Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.  I found Dickie's rings.  You've got Dickie's rings.  Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.  I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.  He promised me. <i>I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day -</i>  (like a creature caught in    Why? When?

Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here - perhaps we could split the rent on a house - I'll get a job - or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here -  - you see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.    Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.  You love me and you're not marrying me.  No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.  What?    Sure - I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a - and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me...you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?   Shut up! Just shut up! Just shut up!  Can I have my key, please?    Hello Marge.  How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?  I was just looking at you - - so quiet.  I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.  I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.  Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.  He was thinking of you, Marge - he asked me to deliver this.  Errand number one - deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.  Search me. I guess we're abandoned.  I think you're right.       Yes, I'd like you to telephone the Hotel Goldoni. Yes. I want to speak to Signor Thomas Ripley - No <u>R</u>ipley, R, yes. Grazie.  Pronto? Signor Ripley is not there? I'd like to leave a message. Yes. Please call Dickie - <i>Dickie Greenleaf</i> - at the Grand.     He's not there?  Very well. I'll leave a message - <i>Got your call. Dinner tonight sounds fine. Ripley</i>. Dinner tonight, yes, is okay. Yes, thank you.  I'd like these to have my initials - embossed, I don't know the word in Italian ...embossed?  What?      I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.  Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.  I know.  I don't want too many large bills. Nobody will change them.     I'll take them both.    Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.  There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.  Thanks, yes, I think we did.  Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?  No. Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.    Marge, you know Dickie has <i>I hate Opera</i> tattooed on his chest.  I am.  I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.  Thanks.  I can't later.  Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?  Ten thirty?  Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow. It's really good to meet you.  Let's go.  Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.  C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.  You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now - I look at you and I see her face - and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you - I just can't...  Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.  Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.  Exactly. 10.30 - 10.15.  Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy - never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?  Hi. Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...  I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to -  Really? That's swell. No, I was just - you're way ahead of me! Great!  My God.  It's fantastic. I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.          Hello?  Who is it?  Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.  Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?  I guess.  He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.  What about Christmas?  Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.      You should watch that!  Hardly.  Freddie, do you have something to say?  I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.              Yes?     I can't be absolutely sure - 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks - but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.  I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?  Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.  Postmortem?  Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.  Marge, when did you get here?  I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.  Dickie did it.  My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have.  About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us.  And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me. Are you getting on?  Get on. I'll take you to him.  We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie -     Can we go up? Do you mind?  My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.    I really don't want to see anybody.  Even her.  What about Ripley?     Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.  Was it? Did you speak to Tom?  I don't remember the exact date.  A few days ago.  No!  It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.  31 people.   (Baggio is on his way to the  Thank you.  I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me.  Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.  I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.  It is a little coarse, yes.  I have!  No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! and if I could remember which hotel he was staying at - <i>the Goldoni!</i> - Tom was staying at the Goldoni.  Absolutely.       <i>My dear Tom, I'm getting out of this. Freddie's death, Silvana. I've thought about going to the police, but I can't do it, I can't face it.  I can't face anything anymore...</i>      <i>...I wish I could give you the life I took for granted. You've always understood what's at the heart of me, Tom. Marge never could. I suppose that's why I'm writing this to you, the brother I never had. The only true friend I ever had. In all kinds of ways you're much more like the son my father always wanted. I realise you can change the people, change the scenery, but you can't change your own rotten self. Now I can't think what to do, or where to go. I'm haunted by everything I've done, and can't undo. I'm sorry, I can't go on. I've made a mess of being Dickie Greenleaf haven't I?</i>  Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.  What rumour?  It's okay.      It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.  In Rome, about three weeks ago. I knew that one.  I've been backpacking.  No.  Tell him I have a fiancÈe, Dickie has a fiancÈe and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.  What did he say?       You opened this?     Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful - it all makes sense, doesn't it? inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.  Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.  Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say <i>open up, step inside</i>, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...  I keep wanting to do that - fling open the door - let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out...starting with myself...the thing is, Peter, if...  Hello Marge!  I was looking forward to seeing him.  That's a terrific idea.     Peter found it for me. I can afford it because it's damp and, and falling down.     Look at me what?  Mr Greenleaf.  I'm well, thank you.  Yes it is.  And you, sir?  Any better?  Yes.  What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?  I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.     I think it might hurt her to know.  I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.     I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.  He's having an early night.  I'll fix some drinks.  I'm fine.  It's okay.     Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.  What?  I can explain.  Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.  Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.  Shut up! Shut up!  I'm wet, Marge, I've lost my towel, I'd really like to put my clothes on. So go and pour us both a drink, will you?     Marge?  Where are you going?  The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome - I tried to tell you this - he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.  Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him - well, you know that. Marge. I loved you - you might as well know - I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. <i>Tom loves me.</i>  I told you. He gave them to me.  I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.  It's all true.  You're shivering, Marge. Can I hold you? Would you let me hold you?  You try. You try talking to her.       Is Mr Greenleaf here?  Hello, sir. Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?  You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday - I clean forgot - ridiculous.    I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?  Okay.  I hope she never knows.    But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.  I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month - and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way - he's in rehearsal, otherwise -  What?  Oh Marge.  Ask me what I want to change about this moment.  Nothing.  All kinds of things. Making plans.  I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.  Well, that's entirely your fault.  And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.  Hello Meredith.  Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.  Just kidding. Are you alone?  Of course.  Aunt Joan.  I've thought about you.  I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.  They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.  I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?  You know what - I am.   (and he understands this is not  Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.    Hardly kissing. Kissing off.  I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.  Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?  Well that would be even better gossip.  I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my - terrible and alone and dark - and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.  I suppose I always thought - better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.  Peter, I... I...  You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.",

Standing Room Only.  Chop, chop, Tommy!  You're going to have to sit between us. But don't put your shoes on the seat, know what I mean, put them one on top of the other.  Okay?

If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.  The landlady - as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.  Because he's been hiding from me - what happened at Christmas?  He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.  Which is horseshit.  Have you heard him play that thing? He can't.  No thanks. Some kid at the American Express Office. Are you living here?  Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? - so bourgeois.  In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.  Have you done something to your hair?  What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity - or to something else.  Is it on <i>\"delle Croce, just off the Corso\"</i>? You're a quick study, aren't you?

Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.  No.  Of course. What happened to your face?  Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no - even to your fiancÈe.  Even your fiancÈe...?  What about Thomas Ripley?  You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo, is that right?  November, I thought.  November 7th is my information.  And when did you last see Signor Ripley?  Does he stay with you here?  No.  Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see <i>oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo</i> and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.  31 people.  That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.    Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?  Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.  Sorry.  No-one has seen Signor Ripley since San -  You have, yes.  Good. The Goldoni. Yes - you're right. A coincidence. I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.     <i>Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood.

I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.  Well hurry, before we sink. Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?  Look there's Meredith thingy - who's that, Marge? - they're in textiles... Meredith - God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!  Will we see you later?  And tomorrow?  I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?  We'll be there.  Of course it is, Meredith, hello, I'm sorry, half-asleep, how are you? This is Marge Sherwood. Meredith Logue.  Join us, won't you? We're just waiting for a friend. Do you know, I wonder did we see you at the Opera last night?  Well no, as it happens, although...  No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.  Not at all. Morning Tom.  We think he's had a change of heart. So we should be celebrating.     But the point is Dickie - well we know this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...    Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?  That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.  Welcome to Venice.  This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it?  Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.  Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally.  We're waiting for someone from Rome.  That's good, isn't it?  You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered -          I don't know how to translate that. E difficile....il signor Ripley ....dormiva all'aperto, con un...  He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.  Are you a homosexual? Interesting non-sequitur.       He says <i>so many fiancÈes</i>.  He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?  He's already angry, I don't think -    They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.     Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?  But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...  Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.  That's the music talking. Harder to be bleak if you're playing <i>Knees up Mother Brown</i>.    I think we sort of found each other.  Where's Dickie's father?  No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?  That's why Tom wanted you to stay.  It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.  What's funny?  You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?  Not guilty.  Are you okay?    Or I could come back.  Your key.  Tom, are you okay?    You can't be angry with her.  She's upset and needs someone to blame. So she blames you.  I'll go home and talk to her.  As for you - either get a safety razor or grow a beard.  What do you want to change about this moment?     Hello.  What are you up to?  Plans - good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?  You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though.  Come back. You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.     How was it?  Was that Meredith?  Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.  Didn't look that way - you know - from a distance.  Why lie?  Or <i>Tom</i> and Peter even.  Really, why? Sorry, I'm completely lost.  What do you mean <i>lied about who you are?</i>  What are you talking about - you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.    Good things about Tom Ripley?  Could take some time!...

When the wealthy father of a recent Princeton grad chats Tom up, Tom pretends to know the son and is soon offered $1,000 to go to Italy to convince Dickie Greenleaf to return home. In Italy, Tom attaches himself to Dickie and to Marge, Dickie's cultured fiancée, pretending to love jazz and harboring homoerotic hopes as he soaks in luxury. Besides lying, Tom's talents include impressions and forgery, so when the handsome and confident Dickie tires of Tom, dismissing him as a bore, Tom goes to extreme lengths to make Greenleaf's privileges his own.—<jhailey@hotmail.com>",
