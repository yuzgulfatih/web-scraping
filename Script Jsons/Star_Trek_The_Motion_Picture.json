        "Rand": "Starfleet, override us!                 OVERRIDE...! Yank them back!        Suddenly, from Rand's console,a VIOLENT GLARE -- a       PROTESTING SOUND from the circuitry. And on the con-       sole a red-warning light now begins flashing.                   Oh, no! They're forming!          gazing, horrified, at the empty chamber.                    Permission granted, sir!        And McCoy moves toward the door, grumbling:                                McCOY                 I hear Chapel's an MD now; I                 need a top nurse, not a doctor                 who'll argue every diagnosis...                 And --        Even when he's in the corridor his grumbling trails       after him.                                McCOY                  ... they've probably redesigned                 sickbay, too. Engineers love to                 change things.",
        "Chekov": "Departure angle.        We SEE viewer IMAGE SWITCH to a departing view of       lovely bluish, cloud-laced image of Earth as it grows       smaller, smaller, dwindling quickly as the starship       gathers speed.                   Photon torpedoes armed...!                    Torpedoes away...!                    We're out of it...!                    Negative damage report, sir.                  No casualties reported, sir.                                McCOY                  Wrong, Mr. Chekov, there are                 casualties. My wits!                  As in 'frightened-out-of'...!                   It is a courier, Captain. Grade                 One priority. Non-belligerency                 confirmed.                   Granted, sir! Granted!        Spock is already moving out of the pod entry area, im-       passive, no greeting on his lips; no friendship in his       expression.          pushing <u>red alert</u>. The ALERT SOUNDS; the red lights       begin FLASHING.                   Red alert! Red alert!                   All decks and divisions confirm                 status red.                   Should I go to battle stations,                 sir.                   Forcefields and deflectors up                 full, Captain.          as a sheet of GREEN WHIPLASH ENERGY bursts from       Chekov's console -- a LASH of FLAME <u>engulfs Chekov's</u>       <u>arm</u>. Automatic fire control nozzles SPURT FOAM over       him as he falls twisting and groaning in pain. Ilia       reacts first, crossing quickly to assist Chekov --       Decker joins her, taking over Chekov's console.          Over the following, we will HEAR Captain Kirk AD LIB       order; \"Divert auxiliary systems power to deflectors!\"       and SCOTT INTERCOM VOICE answer: \"All auxiliary power       to deflectors, sir.\" Meanwhile, Chapel and Corpsmen       giving medical treatment to Chekov who is in agony.       Chapel is about to give an injection.                   No weapons...!        But Chekov is too late: First Security Man FIRES --       the BLAST harmlessly absorbed by the Probe which emits       a SCREECHING nerve-grating SOUND --- sends out a SMALL       WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT which instantly envelopes First       Security Man in a PURPLE GLOW . Second       Security Man has almost lifted his phaser -- but now       carefully, slowly is moving his hand away from his       weapon.                   Security... do not send further                 teams!        The Probe is sending out snake-like tendrils to the       various consoles on the bridge.        These tendrils lash out in a cobra-strike movement,       the tendril-head seeming to enter <u>into</u> the console       affected -- at which time all monitors and instrument       lights there come ON as if the Probe is \"reading\"       each console function. The crew carefully stays clear       of the tendrils.        Spock has risen, moving to Kirk's side as he slowly       brings his tricorder up, <u>very</u> carefully extracting       its tiny sensor and aiming it at the probe.                    No intruder readings on other                 decks, Captain...                  Can that be one of their crew?                   Absolutely, I will <u>not</u> interfere!          Reacting to a console reading:                   Deck four, Captain; Officers'                 Quarters...!                    Sir! Airlock four has been opened;                 a thruster suit is reported missing!                   Airlocks two and four --                 prepare to launch rescue                 teams!                  Chief Lang! Get them out                 there! Fast!                   He... they... are in Engineering,                 sir.          Three of the four OMINOUS SWIRLING GREEN OBJECTS have       all moved away from V'ger now, in different directions,       growing smaller in the distance. The <u>fourth</u> object is       holding position nearby, seeming to grow in size and       intensity.                   They reach final position in...                 Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.                   Twenty-five minutes to device                 activation, sir.  <u>ALT</u>. <u>ALT</u>.                   Tractor beam strength lessening,                 Captain.                   Tractor beam is released.          reacting to a console reading with surprise.                   Captain... I read an oxygen and                 gravity envelope forming outside                 the Enterprise...!                   We are now checking with Starfleet                 Archives, Captain. Stand by.                   Both signal and frequency                 confirmed, sir.",
        "Uhura": "as she is the first to see him. She reacts,pleased.                   Captain... Starfleet just                 signaled your transfer-of-                 command orders!                    Ensign -- our chances of coming                 back from this mission in one                 piece may have just doubled...!          standing near an intercom, which just then has emitted       a bosun's WHISTLE intercom signal.                   Transporters Room and Chief                 Engineer Scott report trans-                 porter system fully repaired                 and now functioning normally,                 sir.                   Captain, Transporter Personnel                 reports the Navigator...                  ... Lieutenant Junior Grade Ilia                  is already aboard,                 and en route to the bridge.                   She's a Deltan.        Uhura's tone and expression convey \"Deltan\" in a       certain, special manner.          receiving a message, now relaying it.                   Captain, Starfleet reports our                 last six crew members ready to                 beam up...                  ... but one of them is refusing                 to step into the transporter.        Just as Kirk a moment before was tense, now suddenly       he's relaxed again; he rises.                   Dock control reports ready, sir.                   Yard command signaling clear,                 sir.                   Subspace frequencies are jammed                 by Wormhole effect!                   Communications are normal,                 Captain.                   Bridge to Captain.                   Signal from a Federation-registered                 long-range shuttle, sir. She                 wishes to come alongside, and                 lock on.                   That's how we <u>all</u> feel, Mister...        The same cold glance causes Uhura to stop in mid-       sentence. Several grins directed toward Spock are now       fading from bridge crew faces. Spock has turned back       again for a last quick reading at the console and now       stands -- totally ignoring everyone else as he speaks       coolly, unemotionally to Kirk:                   Continuing friendship messages on                 all frequencies, sir.                    No response to friendship                 messages, Captain.                   Negative, no reply, sir.                   It could hold a crew of <u>tens</u>                 <u>of thousands</u>...!                                McCOY                 Or just one thousand, ten                 miles tall.                    Unable to make contact with                 Starfleet. Our transmissions                 out of the Cloud are being                 reflected back.                   They're pulling us <u>inside</u>...!        All face the Viewer again, react, with McCoy who has       been observing all these reactions now galvanized       into action:                                McCOY                  Medical observers to all decks!        And he hurries toward the elevators, CAMERA WITH HIM       a moment, then SWINGING BACK TO:          Reacting to a console reading:                   Captain, photic-sonar readings                 indicate the aperture is closing;                 we're trapped, sir...!                    Bridge to Captain...                    A faint signal from Starfleet,                 sir. They have the intruder on                 their monitors...

They -- have Intruder on their                 monitors -- it's decelerating --                 powerfield cloud beginning to                 dissipate...                   A faint signal from Starfleet,                 sir! Intruder Cloud has been                 located on their outer monitors                 for past twenty-seven minutes...                 dissipating rapidly as it approaches.        Immediately, <u>Sulu's</u> voice:                   Ready, Captain.                   We're now locked into Starfleet's                 transceivers; Admiral Nogura has                 received your reports, sir.                   The visual is a lunar monitor                 relay, sir.        As they begin to study it, the IMAGE suddenly distorts and       is replaced by signal interference -- SIGNAL STATIC LINES                   Heavy interference, sir -- it's                 coming from here, inside the                 intruder itself...        Uhura hits buttons and immediately from the speakers we       HEAR A SERIES OF CARRIER WAVE BEEPS. Spock looks up from       his console, listens to it.                   On an old style <u>radio</u> frequency,                 sir...                    Sir! V'ger's signals have                 stopped...                   Picking up Starfleet again; a                 lunar monitor relay...                    <u>Urgent</u> signal from Starfleet,                 Captain!                  <u>All</u> Earth defense systems have                 gone dead.        Kirk reacts hard at this. Uhura gets another message.                    Sir, Starfleet computes their                 trajectories as moving toward                 equidistant positions over Earth.                   Starfleet has been apprised of                 our situation, Captain.                   Sir, I have located the source                 of V'ger's radio signal:                 directly ahead.                   Enterprise to Captain...                   Problem, Captain: the response                 signal is not in our records.                 Voyager Six was sent out by Earth's                 \"United States Subdivision.' The                 code was probably...                   ... kept secret to keep Voyager's                 data from rival subdivisions.                                McCOY                 That's preposterous! They                 wouldn't have kept <u>scientific</u>                 data from one another.                   We now have the response code,                 sir.                   Affirmative, Captain. For some                 time now.                   Starfleet signal, Captain!                 Return to orbital dockyard for                 inspection.",
        "Decker": "I thought so! See... the trans-                 porter sensor was not activated...                   Admiral Kirk...                  We're getting a top brass send                 off...?                  She'll launch on schedule if we                 have to tow her out with our bare                 hands. Right, Scotty?                   Let me now when the back-up is                 in place.          as Scott AD LIBS a glum \"Aye, sir,\" and watches them       walk across the Chamber.                   All due respect, sir, I hope                 this isn't a Starfleet pep talk;                 I'm just too busy.        Kirk eyes Decker -- then decides the best way to say       it is plainly, directly.                   You are what...?                    -- You, personally, are assuming                 command?                   May I ask Why?                   Admiral, this is an almost totally                 new enterprise. You don't know                 her a tenth as well as I do.                   No, Admiral. I don't think you are;                 not one damned bit. I remember                 when you recommended me for this                 command. You told me how envious                 you were, and if only you could                 find a way to get a starship                 command again. Well, sir, it looks                 like you found a way.        Kirk is silent a moment, peering levelly at Decker,       who returns the gaze with equal intensity. Then:          hurrying down the corridor. The two face each other       a silent moment, Decker studying Kirk curiously.                   None available, Captain. There's                 no one in fact, who's fully rated                 on this design.          as Decker  reacts,       almost startled, and Uhura continues:          as Ilia starts to speak, suddenly stops: she has just       then noticed Decker, who has stepped from his station       to face her. For an electronic moment their eyes meet,       hold in unquestioned recognition.                   Hello, Ilia.                   I was stationed on the Lieutenant's                 home planet some years ago...        Ilia looks from Kirk back to Decker, puzzled at his       sleeve stripes.                    Captain Kirk has the utmost                 confidence in me.        Kirk flashes a hard glance at Decker, then toward       Ilia too.                   Mr. Sulu, take Lieutenant Ilia                 in hand.                   I now the Captain meant no person-                 al insult.          punching in equations on his console, reaching a       reading:                   Captain, assuming we have full                 Warp capability, accelerating to                 Warp Seven on leaving solar system                 will bring us to IP with the                 Intruder in twenty point one hours.                   Program set for standard Warp                 entry, Captain...        Kirk starts to swing his chair to normal position --       Decker calls:                    ... but I still recommend                 further simulation study.

When they went into                 anti-matter imbalance, the                 phasers were automatically cut                 off.        Kirk is surprised by this information, perhaps slight-       ly chagrined. After a beat:                   Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar-                 rassed you.                    I'm aware of that, sir.                   Permission to speak freely, sir?                   Sir, you haven't logged a single                 star hour in two and a half years.                 That, plus your unfamiliarity                 with the ship's design -- in my                 opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes                 our mission.        Kirk reacts with anger. Struggles for and regains       control.                   Yes, sir, I'll do that.        Kirk peers at Decker, who stands facing him       determinedly.                   No more than I expected                  Not as difficult as this. I'm                 sorry...                   If I'd seen you again, would you                 have been able to say it?                    Of course not. I'm aware of                 Mister Spock's qualifications.                   Recommend defensive posture,                 Captain: Screens and shields.                    Captain, we've seen what their                 weapons can do. Shouldn't we                 take every possible precaution -- ?                           (interrupting in mid                          sentence                 Captain, as your Exec, it's my                 <u>duty</u> to point out alternatives.        A moment of thought from Kirk.          Decker turning to Spock                   That measures <u>twelve</u> power?                 Ten thousands of starships couldn't                 generate that much...        Decker trails his words, realizing that Spock isn't       hearing a word. Spock's attention is on the O.S. main       viewer, totally absorbed by something he's feeling.       He is slowly rising from his seat, stepping forward --       Kirk becomes conscious of this, turns and sees Spock's       strange expression. Before he can speak:                   Signal medical alert, Mister                 Chekov!                   Transmitting...!                   They may have attacked only as                 a warning to us, Captain. To                 keep away.                   I advise caution, Captain; we                 can't withstand another attack.                   That's precisely the point,                 Captain. We don't know                 it will do. Moving into the                 cloud -- at this time, is                 an unwarranted gamble.                   You asked my opinion, sir.        Kirk looks at him, then at Spock, who once more is       peering in momentary concentration at the viewer,       feels Kirk's gaze -- and turns to him, again expres-       sionlessly; it's up to Kirk.                   <u>Incredible dimensions</u>, Sir!                 ... I make it as <u>seventy-eight</u>                 <u>kilometers in length</u>...        All digest the dimensions, as:                   Don't interfere with it...!                   It's taken control of the                 computer...!                   We could have cut it off at the                 main computer...          helpless, shocked, gazing at the place Ilia was --       but which is now empty.                           (to Kirk, quiet                          fury                 This is how I define unwarranted!        And almost at the same moment a new BRIDGE ALARM                   The ship is under attack...!                 Man all defensive stations...!                    Chief Difalco to the bridge;                 on the double!                   Captain, suggest a maximum phaser                 strike directly at the beam might                 weaken it just enough for us to                 break free --        Spock replies for Kirk: quickly, as though to make his       point convincingly:                    We don't <u>know</u> that, Mr. Spock.                 Why are you opposed to trying?                  Before Spock can reply:                    Why bring us inside? Not to                 destroy us; they could have                 done that outside.                   It's a programmed <u>mechanism</u>,                 Mr. Spock...          also comprehending, and not liking it one bit as Spock       and Kirk are both turning their attention to him.                   That probe in there -- in a                 different form now -- is the                 same thing that <u>killed</u> Ilia!           as Decker looks at \"Ilia\" who stands at the torn door.       You can read Decker's mind: I'm supposed to persuade       that?! He turns back, finds Kirk's eyes on him.       Decker nods.                   Aye, sir.        \"Ilia\" and a reluctant Decker EXIT.                    All these vessels were called                 \"Enterprise\".        \"Ilia\" is giving the pictures a very interested look       as we HEAR in Kirk's cabin:                   The carbon units use this area                 for recreation...                  What type of recreation does the                 crew aboard your vessel enjoy...?                   Ilia 'enjoyed' this game... she                 nearly always won --        And he demonstrates again, as \"Ilia\" steps to the       device, deftly hits some buttons -- and for just an       instant she turns to Decker with a momentary glimmer       of recognition.          Decker waving back toward the general area of the       Enterprise pictures.                   The crews of the previous                 Enterprises were also carbon units.                 In what way is the life form in                 your vessel different?                           (hoping he's struck                          a responsive chord                 Yes.                    What is Enterprise's proper                 evolvement?                    Enterprise would be unable to                 function <u>without</u> carbon units.          as he reacts to this ominous note; he stops abruptly.                   What does that mean?                   Within you are memory patterns of                 a carbon unit. If I can help you                 revive these patterns; you could                 understand our functions better.          realizing the difficult task ahead; the pain he will       suffer.                    ... when we met.        Clearly this is <u>very</u> painful to Decker. Meanwhile,       Chapel hands the <u>Deltan headband</u> to \"Ilia\".                    On Delta... remember...?        And it seems that \"Ilia\" does remember. She peers at       her image, then sets the headband into its exact       proper position. Then she turns and looks at them       with recognition.          as Chapel smiles, pleased, and looks at Decker who       stares at \"Ilia\" nonplussed. This is Ilia coming       alive!                    Ilia, help us make direct contact                 with V'ger...                   Then tell us who V'ger is; where                 he's from... W need your help.        For another moment \"Ilia\" continues smiling at Decker,       holding his hand. Then, abruptly, the smile vanishes       -- the hand is released. Clearly, she's again the       probe, as:                   They want to make contact with                 V'ger...                         (trying to revive                          \"Ilia's\" memory again;                          touches her hand                 Ilia...        \"Ilia\" peers at him blankly, allows him to continue       touching her hand, but obviously it means nothing to       her.                           (continuing;                          distressed,                          to \"Ilia\"                 Does V'ger object to the presence                 of the two carbon units?                   You said V'ger's purpose was to                 find and join with the Creator.          as now, the bemusement changes to just the slightest       enlightenment.                     A machine...! Then it had to be                 programmed. By <u>whom</u>...?                    To join, and become One with the                 Creator?                   Thank you, Scotty...        He moves to leave.                    V'ger is announcing that it has                 arrived, sir -- that it's ready                 to deliver the information it                 was programmed to collect...                    It expects a return signal now,                 ordering it to transmit that                 information to the Creator.          as Kirk vaults from his chair, strides to a handrail to       confront the \"Ilia\"-probe.                    It seems we <u>all</u> imagine God in our                 own image.                    Of course: we all create God                 in our own image.        Kirk peers at Decker a moment, ingesting this thought.       Then he addresses \"Ilia\" again, this time with emotion:       after all, he is pleading for the survival of the       entire planet:                    Needing <u>what</u>...?                                McCOY                 Spock, this 'child' is about                 to eliminate all life on Earth;                 how do we teach it that that's                 'wrong'? With a <u>spanking</u>...!?        Spock peers at McCoy almost sadly, then replies to       Decker.                           (to \"Ilia,\"                          urgingly                 Ilia... we can <u>help</u> V'ger                 find what it needs --        \"Ilia\" studies Decker just a bland beat, then turns       to Kirk:                    Bridge to all decks,secure                 your stations.                                McCOY                 Your child is having a                 tantrum, Spock.                   All ship's functions going to                 automatic, Captain.                  Forward motion, Captain...!                   Captain, what's the next move?                           (into intercom,                          voice amplified                 All personnel resume stations...!        At the same time the lights are brightening -- and       members of the bridge crew begin returning. All this       time there is an ever increasing sense of movement.       Kirk glances at Decker:                   I'm afraid our hand is pretty                 weak, Captain.                  But it's the only game in town.        Kirk reacts, pleased, a split beat at Decker's \"our\"       hand, and goes on:        Kirk throws him a look of appreciation, then, abruptly       his manner changes as he addresses Chekov:                    Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need                 to fulfill itself?          as Decker reacts with sudden, almost evangelical en-       lightenment, as Kirk Says:                   Captain, we can't be sure that our...                 move... will actually save Earth.        We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,     we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.        All this has caused Kirk to vacillate, but he still       believes his course of action is the proper one, as:-          as Kirk strides toward the elevator, joining McCoy and       Spock.                    Captain... I'd like to go along...        Kirk studies Decker a beat -- there is something com-       pelling about Decker's manner -- a certain sense of       absolute necessity. Kirk seems about to deny the re-       quest, then turns to Sulu:          as he moves to her:                   We need only a few more minutes.                 <u>Believe</u> me...        Decker has reached out to touch her -- the probe spins       at his touch -- the move knocks Decker from his feet,       tumbling, a hard fall. Then the robe looks at him       lying there -- just the slightest softening of her       features now.          slowly turning to face the probe again.                   Ilia, believe me... the Creator                 will appear!          Kirk, Spock and McCoy are standing some distance from       them . The probe is clearly moving       into still closer touch with Lt. Ilia's memory patterns       as Decker takes her hand.                   And when V'ger melds? What will                 happen to you?          at the side of Voyager Six, Decker in the midst of       twisting a wing-nut which releases a hatch which swings       open. Decker peers inside while \"Ilia\" waits.  375   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY                                      375        Decker and \"Ilia\" at the old capsule in b.g. as Kirk       looks that way.          catching Decker in the midst of pressing a control on       his tricorder. Both he and \"Ilia\" are watching Kirk       and the others closely. Now Decker looks down at the       tricorder's face. He nods:                   Recording...  377   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY                                      377        still waiting. They continue to wait. McCoy shifts       uncomfortably, throws Kirk a puzzled glance. Kirk       finally lifts his communicator.                    Captain Kirk!                    The fault is here, sir, not in                 the transmission.                         (indicating into                          hatch                 The antenna leads have been                 disconnected. V'ger never                 intended to accept a transmitted                 signal.                   And plug the signal directly into                 the circuitry at this...                         (indicates into                          access                 ... point here, Captain.

        "Chapel": "Mr. Spock...!!!                                McCOY                 So help me, I'm actually                 pleased to see you.        But as Chapel crosses to Spock, her pleased smile       brightening her whole face, Spock turns, dismisses her       presence with a cold disinterested glance -- Chapel       stops, stands dumbfounded. Spock gives McCoy a similar       glance - turns back to his console readings as:                    An osmotic micro-pump... here                 and here. Even the smallest                 body functions are exactly                 duplicated.                         (traces with finger                          on screen                 And every exocrine system is                 here, too --        Chapel breaks off abruptly, noticing \"Ilia\" is peering       intently -- almost with a glimmer of recognition -- at       <u>Decker</u>. Slightly disconcerted, Chapel continues:                    -- even eye moisture.                   I remember Lt. Ilia once mentioning                 that she wore this...                    Put it on.        \"Ilia\" hasn't the slightest idea what to do with the       headband, holds it, runs her fingers over the jewels       and feathers embedded into it. Chapel takes it from       her, places it on 'Ilia's\" head, now switches on the       light illuminating the dressing table mirror -- stands       behind her with Decker, both watching apprehensively.                    Ilia...          as Chapel smiles, pleased, and looks at Decker who       stares at \"Ilia\" nonplussed. This is Ilia coming       alive!                   Now scanning pons area at spinal                 nerve fiber connection...  319   ANGLE ON McCOY AND KIRK                                    319        McCoy at a console, watching readings he is getting       from Chapel's scanner. Kirk watches McCoy anxiously.                                McCOY                 Indications of some neurological                 trauma--the power pouring through                 that mind-meld must have been                 staggering...        Before Kirk can reply, they HEAR a <u>LAUGH</u>! An abrupt,       harsh, bitter laugh.                    A <u>living machine</u>...?!                                McCOY                  <u>We're</u> living machines, too: protein                 mechanisms.        Kirk nods at McCoy.                   If it thinks our ship is alive                 what does it think <u>we</u> are?                                McCOY                  An 'infestation' -- bacteria...                 microbes.",
        "Ilia": "Lieutenant Ilia reporting for                 duty, sir.          as Ilia starts to speak, suddenly stops: she has just       then noticed Decker, who has stepped from his station       to face her. For an electronic moment their eyes meet,       hold in unquestioned recognition.                    Decker....!        Kirk has observed this with surprise and some concern       . Decker turns to       Kirk, slightly uncomfortable at this.                           (eyes his rank                          stripes                 'Commander' Decker?                   My oath of celibacy is on record                 Captain. May I assume my duties?        While respectful, her tone of voice has been just as       firm as Kirk's.                   I'm sworn to celibacy, Mister                 Sulu. That makes me as safe                 as any human female.        Sulu catches her eye but before he can reply, Decker has       moved in beside Ilia.                    I would never take advantage of                 a sexually immature species.                  You can assure him that's true,                 can't you?        Clearly, the remark carries special, personal       significance.                   Orbital departure on plot, sir.          Checking her console.                   Science Officer's computations                 confirmed, sir.        And Decker and Ilia glance at each other -- and again,       you know there is something more than casual in this.                   Unidentified small object has                 been pulled into the wormhole                 with us, Captain! Directly                 ahead...!

Computing new interception                 course.          gazing worriedly at the just-closed elevator doors,       as Sulu is punching figures into his console.                           (a beat; then                          quickly                 Confirmed, Mr. Sulu. Confirmed.        And she punches in some equations, then again peers       up at the doors where she last saw Decker. She is       very concerned.                   Was he difficult?                   That you left? or that you didn't                 say 'goodbye'?                           (long hesitation;                          then shakes head                 No.        Ilia whirls, moves toward her stateroom door, which       snaps open, then closes behind her. Decker stands       gazing at the door, remembering, regretful.                   Five minutes to Cloud boundary!                   No, I can stop his pain.        The Deltan woman takes Chekov's upper arm in both her       hands, kneading her fingers deep into nerve centers --       Chekov's pain begins to quickly recede and he is almost       startled by the sudden relief. Doctor Chapel, now       spraying plasti-skin on the burned hand and wrist,       gives Ilia a surprised, approving look and a flicker       of female friendship passes between the Deltan and       Earth woman.                   Impact in fifteen seconds...        Spock -- Decker assisting -- works frantically. Spock       is clearly dissatisfied, shakes his head tightly.                   Ten seconds....                   ... five seconds.                   Thirty seconds to Cloud                 boundary...                   Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.                   Distance to object now seventy-                 thousand kilometers...                   Mr. Spock, don't move...!        Decker steps toward her, AD LIBBING a grim \"<u>Ilia</u>...!\"       But he has no chance as:          The Probe hovers over her, its whole mass seemingly       about to envelope her with a <u>single tendril extended</u>       <u>toward her</u>, somehow freezing her into immobility -       and then the entire Probe DISSOLVES IN A BLINDING       FLASH OF WHITE, obscuring Ilia. Almost instantly       the WHITE FLASH FADES -- <u>but Ilia has vanished</u> -- her       tricorder clattering to the deck.          Where we SEE, behind the translucent stall door, what       is unmistakably the form of the NUDE FEMALE.            standing in the <u>sonic mist</u>, naked but for a small       <u>multi-colored button embedded in her throat</u>. As she       looks at Kirk -- and the others -- the men peer back       at her, speechless.                   I have been programmed by V'ger                 to observe and record normal                 functioning of the carbon-based                 units infesting USS ENTERPRISE.        Kirk peers at her another nonplussed moment, then leans       into the shower to touch a control, his eyes fixed on       the lovely body behind the mist. He punches in a three       digit code. Immediately a HUMMING SOUND emanates from       the shower stall, Kirk closing the door, but 'Ilia\"       remaining inside.                   V'ger is that which programmed me.                   V'ger is that which seeks the                 Creator.                               McCOY                  Jim, this is a mechanism...!        Kirk stares at McCoy, then at \"Ilia\" and realizes that       \"Ilia\" is indeed non-human. And quickly:                   That unit no longer functions.                 I have been given its form to                 more readily communicate with                 the carbon-based units infesting                 Enterprise.                   V'ger travels to the third                 planet to find the Creator.        Stunned, disbelieving reactions as all four attempt to       digest this -- Spock gazing at \"Ilia\" with even more       rapt fascination. Kirk, bewildered, addresses the       others:                   To join with him.                   V'ger and the Creator will become                 One.                   The Creator is that which created                 V'ger.                   V'ger is that which seeks the                 Creator.        Another moment of total exasperation, frustration, during       which \"Ilia\" seems to be waiting politely, patiently for       any further questions. When none are forthcoming:                          (continuing; pleasant,                         bland                 I am ready to commence my                 observations.                   I am programmed to observe and                 record normal functioning                 procedures of the carbon-based                 units.    256B   Kirk glances at McCoy, who is totally bemused, but then   256B       Kirk quickly responds to \"Ilia\":                    You may proceede.                                McCOY                  Thank you.                    Deck -- er.                   I have recorded enough here.                  You will now assist me further.        Kirk exchanges a quick glance with Spock. Then:                   The words 'recreation' and 'enjoy'                 have no meaning to my programming.        Decker peers at the lovely android with frustration --       and no little pain, for she is after all the exact       replica of Ilia. She pays not the slightest attention       to Decker's reaction, and begins walking about the Rec       Deck taking in (and, clearly, transmitting all images       to V'ger) the sights. They are near a <u>game area</u> (elec-       tronic games), and now Decker points to one game,       <u>switches it on</u> -- presses button to activate its       LIGHTS and SOUNDS. \"Ilia\" watches interestedly as       Decker operates the game.                   This device serves no purpose.        She steps away from the game; Decker's disappointment       is evident. So is everyone elses.          Decker waving back toward the general area of the       Enterprise pictures.                   Carbon units are not true life                 forms... Do those images repre-                 sent how Enterprise has evolved                 into its present form?                   Carbon units have clearly retarded                 Enterprise's proper evolvement.                   Enterprise should not require                 the presence of carbon units.        And with this she moves off, observing other Rec Deck       objects. Decker moves with her; then:                   More data concerning this functioning                 is necessary before carbon units can                 be patterned for data storage.          as he reacts to this ominous note; he stops abruptly.                           (stopping; almost                          pleasantly                 When my examination is complete,                 the carbon units will be reduced                 to data patterns.        This has been delivered with chilling blandness, and       she stands facing Decker, almost as though waiting for       him to thank her. He thinks fast now.                   That is logical. You may procede.          The DOOR SNAPPING open, and \"Ilia\", McCoy and Decker       entering. Then CAMERA REVEALS <u>Chapel</u> already inside,       looking through some female adornments she's found       there.          studying her image in the mirror, her face totally       blank a moment, but then breaking into a bemused       frown -- as though trying to remember. And:                    Dr. Chapel...                    \"Will...\"        And she touches his hand, runs her own hand over it,       and smiles.        Decker is completely overwhelmed, struggles for words       and looks to McCoy for some kind of help. McCoy       realizes Decker is losing himself in fantasy.                                McCOY                  Commander... this is a mechanism...        Decker is startled, and for another slit-second he's       lost -- but then he realizes the reality, and what he       should do:                  I... cannot.        Decker looks at \"Ilia's\" hand still resting on his.       Then:                   Why have two carbon units entered                 V'ger...?        Decker glances at McCoy, who shakes his head almost       imperceptibly: he doesn't know. But Decker has an       obvious reply:                   The carbon units are of no                 consequence; V'ger will determine                 their purpose.                                McCOY                 Their purpose is to survive.                   That is also V'ger's purpose.        Decker's face reflects his bemusement:                   That is how V'ger will survive.                   I wish to continue my observations.                     By the Creator.                   To learn all that is learnable;                 to deliver all collected data to                 the Creator on the third planet.                 That is the programming.                   There is no logical reason for                 carbon units to control Enterprise's                 power systems.                           (to Decker;                          interrupting                 As I stated, V'ger calls to the                 Creator.                   'To learn all that is learnable.'                    Decker... The Creator has not                 responded.        Kirk hears this, turning inquiringly toward her, but       Uhura interrupts:          as Kirk vaults from his chair, strides to a handrail to       confront the \"Ilia\"-probe.                   The carbon-units infection will                 now be removed from the Creator's                 planet.                   The Creator has not answered.                   You infest and control Enterprise.                 V'ger believes carbon-units interfere                 with the Creator in the same manner.                    Disclose the information.                     V'ger requires the information.        Kirk merely looks at her, then to the evacuating crew:                   It is illogical to withhold                 required information.        Kirk does not reply to this, turns away to observe       the withdrawing crew. Most are out; only Spock,       Decker and McCoy remain behind -- with McCoy on his       way. The bridge lighting <u>dims</u>, and now Kirk looks at       Spock, who nods approvingly; clearly Spock is the only       person who seems to comprehend what Kirk is doing, and       why. As Kirk now moves toward the exit, and the lights       are dimmed even further:                    Kirk-unit, <u>why</u> do you not                 disclose information?                   They have repressed the Creator.                    V'ger <u>needs</u> the information.                   V'ger will comply if the carbon                 units disclose the information.  341   ANGLE ON McCOY                                             341        wryly reacting to this:                                McCOY                 It learns fast, doesn't it...?  342   ACROSS McCOY TO KIRK AND SPOCK                             342        as Kirk looks at Spock, Kirk's whole expression convey-       ing the obvious question: \"What the hell do we do now?\"       But Spock is ready with an answer:          watching the  Viewer.                    V'ger...                   The carbon units will now provide                 V'ger the required information.        \"Ilia\" is moving toward the elevator, turning to face       the others as she says this. Kirk remains frozen, his       hand on the intercom button. He glances at McCoy, as       though seeking advice. McCoy peers at him blandly,       levelly; Kirk must follow his own instinct.                   <u>Answer</u>!          as he moves to her:          as she meets Decker's look, her expression softening       still more. The STORM OF LIGHT and SOUND begins to       subside a bit. She moves to him and he gets to his feet.          Kirk, Spock and McCoy are standing some distance from       them . The probe is clearly moving       into still closer touch with Lt. Ilia's memory patterns       as Decker takes her hand.                   It will... take me from <u>you</u>...  373   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY                                      373        McCoy is looking at Kirk with an incredulous expression       on his face.                                McCOY                 And when it realizes what the                 Creator is...?          at the side of Voyager Six, Decker in the midst of       twisting a wing-nut which releases a hatch which swings       open. Decker peers inside while \"Ilia\" waits.  375   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY                                      375        Decker and \"Ilia\" at the old capsule in b.g. as Kirk       looks that way.          catching Decker in the midst of pressing a control on       his tricorder. Both he and \"Ilia\" are watching Kirk       and the others closely. Now Decker looks down at the       tricorder's face. He nods:",
        "Sulu": "He's in Engineering, sir...                         (uncomfortable,                          indicates Captain's                          chair                 He doesn't know.        Kirk reacts with some exasperation, starts away,       addresses Chekov:                   I wouldn't have wanted to have                 been standing in his way. He                 wanted her back; he got her!                   Dock signals clear, Captain.                    Sir...?                  Yes, of course...                  Your pre-programming is already                 set in, Lieutenant.        Sulu has almost tripped getting out of his chair. He       starts offering Ilia his hand, then thinks better of       it, withdraws it abruptly, immediately busies himself       punching out equations on her console... AD LIBS,       \"It's all on the computer. You'll have no problem...\"       Sulu is nervous, fluttery around this lovely creature --       now hits a wrong switch. Produces a BEEPING SOUND which       he fumbles to shut off. She smiles; speaks quietly,       repeats:                   Helm ready, sir.                   Maneuvering thrusters, sir.                    Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.                   Accelerating to Warp One, sir.        Sulu moves his controls forward -- everyone waits       tensely -- and then we HEAR THE INCREASING THROB OF                   Warp point seven... point eight                 ... nine...                   Warp One, sir.        Kirk smiles, pleased, starts swinging his chair around,       at the same time calling:                   Negative helm control, Captain!                 Going reverse on impulse power...!                   Helm control restored, sir.

The viewer shows the QUANTUM LEAP into warp drive. The       stars ahead shift, streak and congeal into WARP EFFECT                   Warp one, sir.

Aye, sir.                   Captain....!          Sulu peering toward O.S. main viewer, his eyes wide       with incredulity.                    We're closing in on it rapidly,                 Captain.        Concern reflected on the faces of others too. Kirk       considers his next move.                    We're already two settings                 below that, sir.                   One hundred kilometers...                   Reverse angle on the viewer,                 Captain.        On the viewer the final glimmer from exterior space       as the \"iris\" closes completely.                   Viewer ahead, sir.                    Thrusters ahead, one third.                    Something ahead, sir; looks                 like another area...                  It's closing up...!        Sulu is indicating what appears to be a lace-bulwark of       POWERFIELD PATTERNS closing off the \"chamber\" in the       distance ahead. Kirk, from the Science Station calls       out:                           (manipulating                          controls                 Thrusters at station keeping...                   Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons                 indicate Intruder on a course                 into Earth orbit...                   Bridge, Captain. We make Spock                 as 26 Mark 345 degrees off ship's                 axis.        During which, Kirk spots something.                   Your phaser, Captain...!                 Use your phaser...!                   Mr. Spock, the Captain is in                 trouble, directly behind you --                 three hundred meters!                  Mr. Spock!        Looks of distress are exchanged.                   Starfleet reports forward velocity                 has slowed to sub-warp speed! We                 are three minutes from Earth's                 orbit!-                   The third one is moving off too --                 a fourth one is forming...                   Clear the bridge, Captain...?                   Tractor beam remains constant...                   Forward motion slowing, Captain...!        Kirk says nothing a moment, studies the viewer -- and       then:                   Forward motion stopped, Captain.",
        "Spock": "Spock's lean features instantly recognizable despite       unkempt, longer hair and the fatigue born of a long,       harsh discipline he has undergone. His robes, tattered       and dust covered, are that of a Vulcan Aspirant in       study with the Masters. Under the V'ger THEME MUSIC       we HEAR a VOICE in ritual tones:          In b.g., gigantic ancient Vulcan statues and ruins. In f.g.,       the stone platform on which Spock stands facing a semi-circle       of three similar platforms. On them in regal robes are three       VULCAN MASTERS. The Master in the center is a female, the       other two Masters are male. The elderly female is holding a       cord and ancient pendant as if ready to place it around        Spock's neck at an appropriate moment. Spock is staring up       as V'ger THEME MUSIC fades.          CAMERA CLOSES IN on his face as we again HEAR a frag-       ment of V'ger THEME MUSIC -- Spock again raises his       head and peers up into the heavens. HOLD on his face       a moment, then...                   Permission to come aboard, sir?                   Commander, if I may...?                   I have been monitoring your                 Starfleet transmissions, Captain,                 your engine design difficulties.        Spock continues to punch information into the science       computer -- a monitor screen IMAGE begins to show com-       plex equations which Spock inspects -- he makes a       further computer punch out and inspects a second  monitor       IMAGE of other equations. Only then does Spock seem to       become aware of Kirk and Decker standing there with       questioning expressions.                    I offer my services as Science                 Officer.        Kirk starts to grin -- then remembers to wipe it off       his face as he turns to Decker.                   With your permission, I will now                 discuss these fuel equations with                 the Engineer.        Kirk manages a nod, a bit dumbfounded himself at Spock's       strange manner. Spock heads for the elevator -- puz-       zled expressions from the entire bridge crew. Then       Kirk calls after him, very sincerely:          Scott making an intermix chamber reading with a hand-       held timer-temperature device which emits SIGNALS while       Spock <u>now in regulation uniform and hair trim</u>, makes       adjustments in the circuitry of a panel complex. Dur-       ing the following, they will react as if they've solved       the engine problem.          Sulu at the helm, accelerating; just a touch of tense-       ness in crew as they move toward the speed which       earlier threw them into the \"wormhole\" effect.                   Reporting as ordered, Captain.                   Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy                 absenting himself from this                 interview.                    Negative, Captain. I could sense                 only what seemed an almost                 omniscient pattern of perfect                 logic. I can explain nothing                 more; I understand nothing more.        Kirk is clearly disappointed -- and a bit uncomfortable       about what he must ask next. He exchanges a glance       with McCoy, then:                   That inquiry invades my personal                 life, Captain.                                McCOY                 Spock, we've already guessed why                 you're here...                           (facing McCoy for                          the first time                 Your deductions do you credit,                 Doctor... if your puerile                 curiosity does not.                                McCOY                  And now, <u>anger</u>, Spock?        Spock looks straight ahead -- his face instantly com-       posed to almost total blankness.                    I still contain fragments of my                 human half.                    ... is my only hope of accomplishing                 what the Masters could not.                                McCOY                 If you achieve perfect logic, Spock,                 you'll pay a price. It's given                 your planet <u>ten thousand years</u> of                 peace, but no poetry's been written                 since then, no music.        Spock has come to his feet fast - but Kirk is on his       feet too, confronting him. During which:                   I have accepted service here as                 a Starfleet officer... sir.                    We are being scanned, Captain.          as Kirk whirls toward Spock's station, calls out:                   Intruder scans emanate from                 the exact cloud center.                 Energy of a type entirely un-                 known to me.                   Twelve power energy field --                    Captain, I suspect there's an                 object at the heart of that cloud.          Decker turning to Spock                   They have... they <u>have</u> been                 communicating with us. I sense                 ... <u>puzzlement</u>. Why have we                 not replied?          whirling abruptly in his chair, addressing Kirk:                   Captain, the Intruder <u>has</u> been                 attempting to communicate! Now                 placing their transmission on                 the speaker...        Immediately, from the SPEAKER we HEAR a SHRILL, IN-       CREDIBLY FAST <u>BEEP</u>.                    ... frequency more than one                 million megahertz at such high                 speed their entire message lasts                 only a millisecond.          so we can SEE in more detail Spock's monitor -- various       oscillating waves, and HEAR more of the SHRILL BEEPS as       Spock manipulates his equipment, and continues:                   I suspect our messages were too                 slow for them to be noticed.                  Programming computer to send                 linguacode at their rate.        Decker has hurried in to assist the science console.       Spock indicates a console area -- Decker works there --       Spock works another section of console buttons.          as Spock hits the \"transmit\" button, and we HEAR the                  It appears that our message has                 been understood, Captain.                   The 'puzzlement' I sensed was                 fleeting... minor...                  ... as if carrying a sense of                 our insignificance, Captain.                   We are obviously confronted by                 a highly advanced mentality...                 yet they cannot understand who                 we are, or what we want.                   That would presuppose a feeling,                 Commander... compassion. I sensed                 <u>no</u> emotion, only...                  ... pure logic.        Kirk peers at Spock hoping for some assistance on       the decision; but Spock merely peers back at him ex-       pressionlessly: the decision is Kirk's. Kirk faces       Spock one last beat, then turns and starts back to-       ward his chair, calling to Ilia.                   Recommend we proceede, Captain.                   Instruments fluctuating, Captain.                 Patterns unrecognizable.          (This will be the first time we've seen Spock dislay-       ing a definite reaction, almost an emotion.) So       engrossed is Spock in the main viewer IMAGE that he       appears not to have heard Kirk, whose AD LIBS a sharp       \"<u>Mr. Spock</u>...!\" Spock looks absently at Kirk an       instant, then:                    That vessel is generating a                 forcefield measurably greater                 than the radiation of the Earth's                 sun.                    A probe from their vessel...                  A plasma-energy combination...        Meanwhile, the probe is now hovering near Chekov who       sits frozen, fists clenched, jaw tight.          as the \"probe\" withdraws an energy-tendril from one       bridge station and \"inserts\" it into another console.                   This served the purpose.        Kirk has been giving Spock a puzzled look -- Spock now       turns abruptly, and:                   Captain, we have been seized                 by a tractor beam...!          as Spock studies his readings, and:                   We cannot break free, Captain.                  We do not have a fraction of                 the power necessary.                   Break free to <u>where</u>, Commander...?                  Any show of resistance would not                 only be futile, Catain...          as Kirk reacts somewhat curiously to Spock's remark,       but it is Decker who articulates it:                    Something about us puzzles them...                 perhaps even concerns them.                   The tractor beam has released                 us, Captain.                           (manipulating                          controls                 Commencing sensor scans.        Kirk rises, goes to Spock's station.          at his Science consoles, working rapidly, shifting from       one set of controls to another. Now he hits a master       control -- his console monitors FLASH, then go dark.                   Captain...        Spock brings a monitor IMAGE ON again, indicates a        pattern showing a line hitting something,       then reversing direction.                    <u>All</u> scans are being reflected                 back, Captain. Our sensors are                 useless.                          (voice increasingly                         reverential                 I believe the light flares to be                 energy fields -- undoubtedly part                 of the vessel's inner mechanism.                 A technology so incredibly                 sophisticated that I cannot --          suddenly alert, addressing \"Ilia\":                    Join with the Creator... ? How?                   Who is the Creator?                                McCOY                  Mr. Spock, be careful.                    Doctor, a thorough examination                 of this probe might provide some                 insight into those who manufactured                 it, and how to deal with them.                                McCOY                 Let's get her to sickbay.        And he grasps \"Ilia's\" arm to escort her. But is as       though he has seized cast iron: immovable. McCoy is       thrown off balance merely by 'Ilia's\" remaining sta-       tionary. She ignores McCoy, addresses Kirk:          as everyone reacts to \"Ilia's\" utterance of Decker's       name. It seems to make the deepest impression on       Spock, confirming something he has suspected.                    Interesting. Not 'Decker-unit'?        \"Ilia\" continues peering at Decker with just a hint       of a puzzled frown, a glimmer of distant recognition.       It's the first time we've seen her expression look       anything but cool and bland. This results in the       quizzical rising of one of Spock's eyebrows.                   Captain... this probe may be a key                 a key to the Aliens.                   We have just seen that its body                 duplicates our navigator in                 <u>precise</u> detail. Suppose that                 beneath its programming, the                 real Ilia's memory patterns are                 duplicated with equal precision.                    ... they may have followed it                 <u>too</u> precisely.                   Exactly.                  And you did have a 'relationship'                 with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.          looking very troubled as they watch Decker and \"Ilia\"       leave. Kirk notices.                   I am uneasy with that being                 our only hope of more information.        Spock EXITS.          His face fixed with grim determination, walking quietly       with obvious intent not to attract the Tech's attention.       Now he steals up behind the TECH -- and in an instant       has applied a <u>Vulcan nerve pinch</u>. The Tech slumps over       his console.                   Computer, commence recording.                 Captain Kirk -- this message                 will detail my attempt to                 contact the aliens...          His features now set into an almost trance-like expres-       sion as he concentrates on the thought emanations.       Then we SEE his head turn, he peers off -- then he       moves his thruster controls. We SEE the small blue       jets of his thrusters -- his spacesuit figure begins       to move off in the direction he was concentrating       upon.          His thrusters moving him across V'ger's vast chamber       then dropping down into a deep \"trough\"-like area       which stretches into the distance ahead of him. A       cloud of CRYSTAL FORMS  become       visible to one side but Spock passes them at some dis-       tance and does not attract them.        We can SEE more clearly now the point on the inner wall       of the trough toward which Spock is heading. It is an       unusual combination of GLOWING FORCEFIELDS which seem       to mark this point of the vessel as of some importance.       (Here, also, we will become aware of \"sensor-bee\"       swarms, intermittently darting toward this same wall       from all points of the chamber.          Spock's spacesuited figure MOVING TOWARD the CAMERA,       as we HEAR:          as Kirk's VOICE STOPS -- and all that is heard now       is the HEAVY STATIC crackling ominously. Spock's       expression flickers, then he hits reverse thruster       JETS, stops -- he turns to glance at the inner wall,       then his thrusters turn him so he can look back the       way he came from. But he cannot resist Kirk's call;       he suddenly hits his thruster controls, then JETS       FLARE, and:          as thruster JETS accelerate him back toward Kirk.          with Spock in the near distance, heading TOWARD the       CAMERA. As he approaches Kirk, Spock brings out his       phaser. Now he hits the controls for the REVERSE JETS --       he slows RAPIDLY as he approaches Kirk's now complete-       ly encased spacesuit. Spock makes a quick phaser       adjustment.          Spock levels the phaser carefully. FIRES. The PHASER       BEAM strikes the blob form -- it SHATTERS, the pieces         facing each other while hovering in space.                   I am seeking answers, Captain.                    Captain, I believe there we will                 find an indication of whoever --                 or whatever -- is aboard this                 vessel...        Kirk weighs alternatives, then pushes his thruster       controls and begins moving in the direction Spock       indicated.        Their thruster jets flash, propel them toward the       point on the inner wall.          as they approach and then we SEE the brief REVERSE       THRUSTERS and then forward momentum stops; motionless.       Then Spock sees something, indicates.          This \"sensor swarm\" has been coming from a direction       that will take them close past Kirk and Spock. Then,       as it passes, Spock reaches out quickly, grabs.       He turns to Kirk, his hand closed on something.          Spock opens his hand, retaining a hold on something       with his fingers. He brings it up to Kirk's face mask       -- it's a tiny SENSOR, its multi-colors flashing as it       tries to escape from Spock's fingers. And in this CLOSE       VIEW, we SEE that this is a SENSOR very much like the       one we've seen earlier embedded in the Ilia-probe's       throat hollow. Then Spock releases it and it darts       to join the sensor swarm near the opening of the inner       wall.          From this closer distance, <u>we SEE that an opening ap-</u>       <u>pears in the wall, admits the sensor swarm, then closes</u>       <u>immediately</u>.          closely approaching the inner wall now, timing their       movements to coincide with the arrival of another       \"swarm\" -- the wall begins OPENING. The \"swarm\"       through, the wall begins CLOSING -- but Spock and       Kirk slip in before it closes.          The wall closing behind them, they are safely inside.       But as they stop their forward momentum, their eyes       widen with awe and surprise at what they are seeing:          as Spock makes a quick analysis and estimate of what       they are seeing. Then, he takes out his tricorder       again, propels himself toward the memory crystals.       Kirk follows.                   It would appear that the atomic                 arrays of these crystals store                 information. A remarkably                 efficient system.                    New crystals: they must contain                 the most recent data obtained --        And Spock touches one of these new crystals (it will be       <u>shinier</u>, more <u>pulsating</u> than the others): ANOTHER                    Exact patterns. The energy bolt                 that hit them wasn't simply a                 weapon -- it dematerialized them,                 stored them. But why?        And he turns and begins moving on, studying the wall,       consulting his tricorder.                   Captain, I do not believe there                 <u>is</u> a crew -- or that this is a                 vessel as such.        A beat, as Kirk reacts incredulously.                    I am almost certain now that all                 of this <u>i</u>s V'ger -- I believe                 that we are inside a life form,                 a <u>living machine</u>.        Spock turns his spacesuit, turns his tricorder out to-       ward the Mediator Balls, takes a reading in that di-       rection. Then a glance to Kirk.                   I <u>mus</u>t attempt mindmeld with it,                 Captain.        Spock touches his spacesuit controls; the THRUSTER       JETS move him out toward the Mediator Balls.          preparing for the ordeal, moving his hand to the \"liv-       ing area,\" the invisible force even stronger -- but       Spock's strength unwavering, and now he <u>touches the</u>       <u>surface</u> -- and it FLARES WITH STRANGE ENERGY at the       touch. And at the same moment Spock' body convulses       as if tens of thousands of volts of electricity are       charging through him.          as he begins to shudder with the shock, the CAMERA       CONTINUES INTO EXTREME CLOSE-UP as we SEE Spock's mouth       open -- he SCREAMS. CAMERA INTO EXTREME CLOSE SHOT OF           MUSIC IN AND UP as we travel through ABSTRACT IMAGES       . Symbolizing V'ger's       incredible and complex store of mechanistic knowledge,       these IMAGES suggest patterns of atoms, molecules,       galaxies, dimensions of the universe beyond human       knowledge or comprehension. It takes only fifteen or       twenty seconds, but seems to span aeons, taking us       through micro-infinity and macro-infinity.           ANGLE ON SPOCK'S FACE as he lies in a sickbay bed. His       eyes are open; he is staring straight ahead as if in a       catatonic state, completly unaware of his surroundings.       Then Doctor Chapel leans INTO SCENE, moving a medical       scanner over the brain area.                    Jim...        And Spock reaches out a hand weakly., takes a surprised       Kirk's hand in his. McCoy exchanges a surprised glance       with Kirk, as Spock -- clutching Kirk's hand in friend-       ship and need -- struggles to summon strength to speak.                    This <u>simple</u> feeling...                  ... is so far beyond V'ger's                 comprehension.                    A life form of its own; a                 conscious, living entity.                   I saw V'ger's planet: a planet                 populated by living machines.                 Unbelievable technology.                  V'ger has knowledge that spans this                 universe.                 And... in all this order... all                 this magnificence, V'ger feels                 no awe...no delight... no beauty...                  I should have known...        Kirk waits for Spock to continue, but Spock seems too       weak.                    No meaning... No hope...                  And, Jim, no answers...!                 Jim, it's looking for <u>answers</u>                 <u>itself</u>!                   'Is this all I am? Is there not                 more?'        Just then an INTERCOM SIGNAL:                   Puzzling! The interference                 appears to be a rather simple                 carrier wave code signal...                           (interrupting; from                          science console                 These read as identical composition...                  ... however, Captain, they measure                 several hundred times more                 powerful!          exchanging significant glances.                   From four equidistant positions,                 Captain, a detonation would blanket                 the entire surface of the planet.                    Then V'ger believes the Creator to                 be a <u>machine</u> too.          who has been listening intently, with near fascination       -- an idea forming in his mind. Quickly, he steps       down to Kirk:                    Captain...                  Treat V'ger as you would... a                 <u>child</u>.                   Yes, Captain, a child: evolving                 into adulthood -- learning, searching                 -- instinctively needing.                   It doesn't know what it needs,                 Comm          ander...                  It does not know.        Kirk says nothing, looks at Spock who is awaiting a       reaction; then Kirk glances at \"Ilia\" -- his brain       is racing, struggling to reach a decision. And then:                   Captain, the vessel -- V'ger --                 obviously operates from a                 central brain complex...        Spock allows the sentence to hang, as he and Kirk       eye each other significantly, the CAMERA SWINGING       OVER TO KIRK so we can perceive that to Kirk this       idea has an even greater significance.                   Precisely.        Kirk nods grimly, faces \"Ilia\" again; this time       he's playing for all the stakes.                   A tractor beam...        \"Ilia\" steps down from the platform and into the well       where she is closer to the viewer.          as Kirk hesitates, glances around at the crew -- now       all having resumed their stations -- and then grimly       looks at \"Ilia\" who still remains at the rail.          His back to the viewer, the angle does not reveal his       facial features, but we can discern him struggling to       contain his feelings.          as Kirk arrives, with Spock still facing away from       him, clearly distracted.                   No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.        Spock pauses as Kirk peers incredulously at him, then       continues:                    I weep for V'ger, as I would for                 a brother -- far more knowledgeable                 than I -- and yet one step behind.  354   ANGLE ON McCOY AND DECKER                                  354        Listening, McCoy's face reflecting concern; Decker's       face compassion and understanding, with Decker step-       ping closer to Spock, as Spock continues:                   As I was -- when I came aboard...                 so is V'ger now: empty, incomplete.                 Searching. Logic and knowledge are                 not enough.                                McCOY                  Spock, are you saying that you                 found, what you needed -- but V'ger                 hasn't?                   Has not, Doctor -- and now, because                 of what we are planning... will not...                   V'ger has begun to understand the                 true limits of our universe,                 thereby realizing the existence                 of other dimensions. To fulfill                 itself it must evolve to a                 higher dimension; V'ger believes                 this can be achieved only by                 joining with the Creator.                                <u>SPOCK </u>                 Each of us, at some time in our                 life, turns to someone, a father,                 a brother, a God and asks 'Why                 am I here?' 'What was I meant                 to be?' V'ger hopes to touch its                 Creator to find its answers.          where another opening is suddenly visible -- another       <u>chamber</u>. But the violent and color energy effects of       the previous chambers are no longer evident. Instead,       the entire chamber appears beautifully symmetrical,       with a strange, subdued glow, which increases as we       move closer.                    Captain, I believe that is our                 destination.                    Captain, the orbital device will                 not be triggered for twenty-two                 minutes...                           (eying \"Ilia\";                          carefully                 The point is, Captain, <u>twenty-two</u>    (<u>ALT</u>.  should                 <u>minutes</u>. We could have that much      loop \"19\" &amp;                 more time...                                 \"15\"       Kirk glances at the Viewer, the oncoming \"island,\" then       at Spock:                   That transmitter is a vital link                 between V'ger and the Creator.                    ... and then to reassemble itself                 <u>combined</u> with the Creator. The                 most certain way of obtaining                 all the Creator's answers.        A sudden STORM OF LIGHT AND STRANGE SOUND. In the       midst of it, Kirk finds a SHAFT OF LIGHT very much       centering on him. He sees \"Ilia\" watching him with       none of their \"former navigator\" in her expression       now. Kirk hesitates, gathering his thoughts:                   That seems to be what it has                 planned -- to have the Creator                 physically present here.                                McCOY                  The God it captures is going to                 be a hell of a disappointment.                   Jim... he <u>wants</u> it.                    Yes, Captain. It needed our                 mortality, the fear of it, our                 struggle against it, our fears,                 our dreams...                    I prefer your poet Dante's phrase                 -- 'the divine restlessness of                 the human spirit.'                                McCOY                 Spock... you're quoting poetry?        Spock's cold look at McCoy is interrupted by:                    I have no business on Vulcan,                 Engineer.        Kirk and Spock exchange a look -- then Kirk turns to       the helm.                    A most logical choice, Captain.        Then the trace of a smile comes over Spock's face.",

    "description": "A massive alien spacecraft of enormous power destroys three powerful Klingon cruisers as it makes its way towards Federation space. Admiral James T. Kirk is ordered to take command of the USS Enterprise for the first time since her historic five-year mission. The Epsilon IX space station alerts the Federation, but they are also destroyed by the alien spacecraft. The only starship in range is the Enterprise, after undergoing a major overhaul in drydock orbiting Earth. Kirk rounds up the rest of his crew, and acquires some new members, and sets off to intercept the alien spacecraft. However, it has been three years since Kirk last went into deep space--is he up to the task of saving Earth?—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com>",
