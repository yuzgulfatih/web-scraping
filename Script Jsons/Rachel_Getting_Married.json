        "Friend": "We're all so glad you made it! I shouldn't be telling you this, but there was actually a pool! Is that hysterical?",
        "Paul": "Hello. I'm Paul Buchman.    There is so much going on at the house I can't tell you. You know your sister's doing all of it herself.  No wedding planners or anything like that. Just her and Sidney and a lot of their friends. She is so thrilled you're here. Is that everything, sweetheart?  You weren't in a cell, Kym...  ...And nobody was crazy, nobody was in a rubber room...  It's a nightmare so bad it's in German.  She's a wigwam!    You'll see her and Andrew at the rehearsal dinner tonight.  I'm making hot dogs and hungabungas! Who wants what?!  What don't you eat?!  Where's Kym?  Ooo! Can I see?!  Okay, okay!  Kymmie, what can I make you?  I'll drive you.  Would you do me a favor, Kymmie...?  You wouldn't believe my insurance. And I'm not... that comfortable. Could we figure something else out?  Carol, she's here!  I made you a sandwich, sweetheart! Meatloaf!  She's making an effort, Rachel.  Rachel. She just got home.  Kymmie, your sister's got a lot on her plate. She's uptight about...  She's meeting Sidney's folks for the first time, there's menus, there's all that live music, you're home, there's a thousand things to worry about.  Yeah, it would be so lovely if we could all just...    What constant monitoring?  That's unfair, Rachel. And completely untrue.  Rachel! It's nice that you're getting your Ph.D--  --but don't be patronizing. It's ugly. It doesn't become you.  What?!!    (laughing, mushing  How long? How much pregnant? Did you tell your mother?  Kymmie, she's pregnant. She's exhausted.  Do either of you want anything? A sandwich? You must be hungry. There's cold Saagwala and a little Aloo Gobi left over?  You're pretty everything!    Don't mess with the King.  Yes, sweetheart?  Of course, lamb chop. I'm so happy! I'm going to be a grandpa!  I know, sweetheart. Me too.  Carol, they're back!    All right. Where were we? Ah yes...The Rosenzwiegs. Can you please put the Rosenzwiegs somewhere far away from me?  They're not my friends. I've just known them my entire life.  Kym, stop it. You're at the family table.  The family table. With us.    She doesn't hate you.  Nonsense!    Have all the days you want. Nobody is taking your day.  Defending her from what? Darling, look, no one's defending any body...  I don't want her to feel like we don't want her.  Stop it. She's your sister.  Okay. Dishes? I'm going to load the dishwasher.  Sidney, you're a nice young man. You make a lot of money and the world is your oyster. But you don't know shit about loading a dishwasher.  You young people should all go fuck yourselves.  Rachel, you're out of the will.  Clean out this machine please, boy. So I can break out the whup-ass.  Rachel, go fetch me my dart gun.  Kieran, how's my time?  I need more dishes. You amateur!  Somebody give me some dishes!  He has a bowl in his hands. We see the bowl is a plastic child's bowl with Engines and Cabooses all over it. Paul turns the bowl around in his hands like a steering wheel. It dawns on Kym that she's handed her father Ethan's bowl. She is stricken. Paul looks to Carol. He seems bewildered. The kitchen falls silent and Carol takes Ethan's bowl and places it in the sink, out of sight. She leads Paul gently out of the kitchen.  You don't hate her.  What do you mean she lied?    Thank god. In here.  Rachel...  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's this all about?  Kym, what is your sister saying? Did you say you were sexually molested?  Were you?  Why in god's name would you say something like that?  And look! She is better!  It was an accident.  No, it was an accident!  It was an accident.  He is alone and the door is shut  Hello Abby. It's Paul.  Is Kym with you?  She left the house about an hour ago.  She and Rachel had an argument.  Look, Abby, it doesn't matter. She left the house. She took the car.  I don't know. They were both getting their hair done...  For god's sake Abby! I'm trying to figure out where she went before I call the police!  She wasn't asleep, she was unconscious! And I'm glad I called the police because it took twenty minutes to wake her up and at least something was being done!  You're trying to dismiss everything!  You're disregarding everything I'm saying, and this failure to listen, failure to understand what is right in front of you is exactly why you will never be able...  ...To help her!    -- Maybe she needs someone to be watchful and present and in her life!  She could hurt herself! She could be lying dead in a ditch somewhere!  If you hear anything, can I count on you to please call me?  Okay, then.  Goodbye.  Abby hasn't heard from her.    ...I never thought I'd have two little girls. Two little girls running around with their tummies sticking out in their diapers. They used to bite me on the nose, the two of them.  I'd hold both of them in the pool and they'd take turns biting my nose. Ethan never did that. He preferred pinkies. Or knuckles...  Kymmie?  Are you all right?  Oh my god is she...     Look at you! You need to get to a hospital!  You can't just vanish. You can't just leave. You have to call. You always have to call.  Ooo. Look at me, I'm dancing.  Kymmie. Speak of the devil. You remember Susanna Galeano.  Susanna has a public relations firm and she just lost one of her assistants.  No, no. Hardly. Well...  The firm is opening an office right here in town, just in time for the holidays. You could stay right here.  Logistically it's just a dream. You could stay in your old room. I could chauffeur you around. You wouldn't have to worry about rent.  Of course. She's fine about it. You could stay in your old room.  Suzy's first rate. P.R. can be fascinating.  I meant stupid. Do you want me to hold that for you? You've got no pockets.",
        "Rachel": "Can we raise this hem half an inch?  Kymmie!  I have pins all over me. You look great!  Hah!  Dad did not say \"blow dealers.\"  You can always shoot up in the tree house.  I will have my PhD. in a year and a half. And psychologists don't get prescription pads, right Kym?  Would you please put that out? Emma designed this dress and there's forty-seven yards of it and I'll go up like the Hindenburg.  She has this great little boutique in Greenwich. She says things like \"you need a fabulous jersey pant.\"  Non-specified Eating Disorder.  Angela Paylin is coming to the wedding.  I know. And she confessed to you her secret Elvis Stoyko fantasy. I spied on you.  In her fantasy, she was wearing her hair up and very serious, responsible eyeglasses, because she was a world renowned judge at the Winter Olympics for Men's Figure Skating. And Elvis Stoyko was skating in the finals to \"Could It Be Magic\" for the gold medal. And just when Barry Manilow is singing \"Now/ Now/ Now and hold on fast...\" there's this electric connection between them and he stops in the middle of his triple lutz...axel...  There is silence as he stops in front of her, their eyes lock, and he reaches for her hand... and Angela takes it!  And he gets disqualified but he doesn't care!  Well, I think you'll be assisting on floral detail. I want everything all drippy and luxurious and Mom's a little bit tasteful--  --and I don't want to upset her.  He went to get stuff with Kieran. They'll be back.  It's too hot!  Besides I'm in my dress!  No!  Kymberly!  No. You guys are not getting my design concept.  I want every single light to represent a different one night stand during the misspent youth of Kris Kringle before he stopped whoring around and became Santa Claus.  I know. We're having an endangered Panda fleeing for its life for the ice sculpture. Or impaling itself on some bamboo. Kym! This is Sidney Williams, my betrothed. Sidney, meet my sister, Kym.  That's fine.  And this is Best Man Kieran.  Isn't the lilac fabulous? You look like a freesia.  You wore a lilac sweater with a cat face on it on the cover of Seventeen Magazine when I was at Fat Camp.  Because.  I wasn't entirely sure when you were coming or even if you'd make it.  I wasn't sure if you'd have time for a fitting.  What are you talking about?  Dad offers Irish Hunger Strikers food every ten seconds.  Oh, leave Dad alone.  Stop! You're like a harpy. Is being my \"Maid of Honor\" this important to you? I didn't think you gave a shit.  Jesus. Emma!  Emma, would you be horribly offended and hurt if I asked you to step down as... ...\"Maid of Honor?\"  Not really.  And bludgeons all and pillages all and leaves all for dead.  You've known most of those people since the eighth grade. You always pretend you don't know people.  Aren't there some rules about helium tanks?  Here's Mom.  Mom, where have you been? Is everything okay?  You're paying for that, Emma.  Sidney's recording studio is there.  That wasn't it?  I have no memory of that whatsoever.  Gotta say no.  Mahamoud! Such a nice man.  Where? Where?  (To Kym, as if she's  (again, making a joke out  I know what the Steps are.  I learned them in school, and I've visited you in various facilities, Kym.  Amends. Noun. Often followed by 'for'. Offset a disability or frustration by development in another direction.  You've never said anything to me, that's remotely apologetic. Yet, all of a sudden, at my wedding dinner, in front of everybody, you decide to grace us all with your development?  \"Hey everybody! And guests! Just in case you might be thinking about something else for five minutes, like, I don't know, my sister's wedding-- they just cut me loose!  I'm a loose cannon, is that hysterical? Anyone for some rehab humor? Because I'm really fine with acknowledging my disease. And now watch me be really selfless, and weave a lovely blanket apology to my sister for being a tad out of her loop.\"  An effort. That's what it was? Because I think she presumes that since everything has always revolved around her disease, everything else is going to revolve around her recovery. That's what I think.  Again.  I'm not.  I'm not uptight, Dad.    Please. That's hardly news. You may not know this...sure you do...the only way to engage Dad in any meaningful communication is to start the conversation with your name. \"Have you heard from Kym? How's Kym?\" It resuscitates him. It jars him into the moment. Like an alarm.  And she's even worse! \"Dad, you're never going to believe this, but I lost the car again.\" \"Dad, you're never going to believe this, but that check you sent me never showed up and my landlord hates me.\" \"Dad, can somebody meet me downstairs with cab fare and you're never going to believe this but I need to go to the emergency room and my neighbor's suing me and my checkbook got stolen!\"  Are you kidding? The two of you are like a double helix of crises. In the language of psychology one could say you both suffer from acute boundary issues.    How come she gets to spout off about paternal issues, but god forbid I should even reference the \"boundary thing,\" even though I actually know what I'm talking about?  You just got out of rehab!  Oh, poor you. You're so much more evolved in your suffering. You know what? Your suffering is not the most important thing in the world to everybody!  There are billions and billions and billions of people, in nations all over the world, who never even think about you! Other people have lives! We have lives! I have a life! I'm in school. I'm getting married. I'm...  I'm pregnant.  I can barely believe it myself!  We told her at dinner.  Kym, you're going to have a niece!  I am so fucking exhausted.  I just...I need to go to bed. Sidney?  Yes.  No thanks, Dad. I really am pretty sleepy.  I've never been so tired in my life.  Dad?  I hope it's okay, I told Mom at dinner. About the baby.  I wish Ethan were here.  Look how exquisite this is. I can't borrow this. What do you carry in here? A vital organ? A tiny spleen?  I love the color. It's oyster.  Yes, Mom.  Fine.  Kieran.  I'm not exactly sure what that means.  You think?  Mom, she's sold syndication rights to her troubles.  Mom, does it bother you at all, Carol doing so much wedding stuff?  Yes, I'm sure, and that's so great and so you, but you can do whatever else you want, you know. I'd love it.  Huh.  You're right.  Hooray!  Is she dead?  It's beautiful. Thanks, Mom. I hope it's a boy.  Can we get back to what we were doing, please?  They're your friends, Dad.  Really? Because right now I have her shoveling kelp in the laundry room. But I have it as a montage.  They're not invited.    I was thinking of putting you with Cookie Puss and the Chicago cousins because they always get really drunk and need wrangling.  You're the only one they're afraid of.  Dad, can I show you something in the kitchen?    Then why are you defending her?  Why are you protecting her?  Sometimes I don't want her. It's my fucking wedding, don't you get it? I want my table to be perfect.  She turns and leaves the kitchen. Sidney follows her. Emma and Norman Sklear step out onto the porch. Kieran takes the Ethan bowl from the sink and puts it quietly back in the cupboard and shuts the door. Kym doesn't know what to do.  Well, she's growing them and choosing them - but they are being delivered by her people.  Kym. Can we talk about the candles for a minute? Because --  Oh my god, no. Don't. Just don't. That would kill Dad. And Mom. And me. And everybody. Please, Kym, please please please don't do that.  Just drop it, sweetie, okay? Please?    Don't touch me.  I never had anorexia. You sure as hell didn't watch over me while I was sleeping and WE DON'T HAVE A    I'm hurt!  I hate her.  Don't tell me what I don't hate. I hate, hate the lies. She lied in rehab.  She lied to the people who were working with her. Who were trying to help her. She lies to everybody.  Where am I now, Dad?    Why not? Why wasn't it about me?  Dad, stop. Why not? I was hopeful. I was on your side. I still am. Do you have any idea what that means? Do you have any idea how lonely it was with everybody gone into your terrible world? There was nothing left. Everybody was just empty. You think they remembered I was alive or needed anything during your... life? And after all that loneliness and Mom and Dad blaming each other and worrying and death and divorce and that stupid hopefulness and Dad not even being able to listen to music, you were in the hospital, lying about us! Instead of telling the truth about yourself!  Apparently she has a whole history of sexual molestation.  Dad, look at me. I'm right here. I'm telling you that after Ethan died I wanted her to get better or just die...    Kym, you took Ethan for granted. You were high for his life. You were not present for his life. You were high. He was like a pet to you. You drove him off the bridge. And now he's dead.  Aaaah! Fuck!  With the car?  You hit Mom? You hit our mother?  I got it.  Can you do this?  Okay.  Yeah, Baby Boy.  Can we all do this together?  Mom.  Friends and family, family and friends! I have an announcement to make! I'm the bride and I'm knocked up!  I'm exercising my bridely, knocked up prerogatives and demand that everybody starts dancing. And this means you too, Mom!  Oh yay! Dad c'mon. C'mon Dad! This is my favorite song!  Taking a break.  Mom doesn't actually participate in things.  I was thinking about getting her a cat. Cats are really annoying. At some point you have to deal with them, right? Or they starve to death and piss on your sheets.    Hello?  Mom!  You're leaving?  You could make a little scene.  What about our post-nuptial wedding gossip reconnaissance, Mom?  Um...  Wait! I want my mother and my sister!  Yes. Of course.  Hi.  Me too.",

        "Emma": "Yeah, yeah. Here, let me just...    Kym!  Kym, I'm not remotely surprised you're starting your drama already, however it's Rachel's wedding and this week it's about her.  Psychology. Not psychiatry. You know the difference, right?  A while.  N.E.D.s?  Elvis Stoyko the figure skater?  Where'd she get the skates from?  She's got everyone she knows pulling elf duty.    It's softball. Someone was chasing them.  I don't eat gluten, Paul!  Gluten!  No!  Pandas are endangered.  We're all wearing lilac.  It's good to have a principle.  That's odd.  Blow me.  I know I have nothing better to think about.  What?  Yes.  Is it what you want?  Fine. The crown is yours, First Runner Up.  It's not about you.  Hooray for sisterhood.  Is it because you owe them money?  Kieran would you like some more Saag Paneer?  And here I was thinking tonight was about Rachel!  Of course. I'd like to make a toast to the happy couple because I want to come visit them in Hawaii.  Sidney what's the name of that place again?  I've known the bride her entire life. Not biblically, except for that one time we french kissed at Evan Yassky's party in the ninth grade.  Commence embarrassing story.  Rach, do you remember the time I was teaching you to drive in the Wagoneer and you sideswiped that taxi driver and knocked off his side mirror?  Do you remember trying to outrun him and leading him on a high speed chase across 96th street?  Well I would like to share with everyone that Miss Rachel-before she got her license or even had any idea how to drive- out maneuvered an irate, screaming cab driver across 96th street to the East river, handily avoiding two EMT guys loading an old lady on a gurney, while at the same time, applying Cocofudge Lip Gloss in the rearview mirror.  Wait, wait. She actually got the number of one of the E.M.T guys and went out with him. Twice.  Anyway, when the taxi driver finally caught up with us, Rachel talked him down from his Middle Eastern fury in pretend Farsi, and ended up using his radio thing to call his dispatcher and recommend this guy for a commendation.  We were driving so fast! It was one of the more exhilarating moments in my life...sadly...but I knew that Miss Rachel would make it okay. So here's to you, my dear, dear friend. A woman who can drive fast, pick up a paramedic, make up languages and get you home in one piece. Sidney, you are a lucky bastard.  Oops. That's nine. I thought you were having tables of eight?

There are several late model cars parked in the driveway of the SPRAWLING, SHINGLED HOUSE. Young people crawling everywhere in the midst of WEDDING PREPARATION, wrapping garlands and hanging paper lanterns. A LITTLE GIRL tosses rose petals in the swimming pool. The atmosphere is slightly punch drunk and friendly. Paul unloads Kym's bags.          The station wagon seen just as before. A couple of joggers lope by on the road.                                         INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD! The musicians blow whistles and bang on drums. The cafe-au-lait beauties gyrate and pull guests out of their chairs. Rachel leaps from her chair into Sidney's arms and he gives her a huge, sexy kiss as he rubs her tummy. Wedding guests scream with delight and rush to the floor. The drummers become more   impassioned with every beat. They travel allover the dance   floor, a trail of guests behind them. Sweat is dripping,   the girls are glistening wet, the guests are pulled into a   massive pulsing heartbeat on the dance floor. Emma, Kayra and Victoria are dancing together screaming until Cousin Joseph, Matt and another male friend muscle their way in. Little kids swing each other around in circles. Rachel and Sidney are practically doing it on the dance floor. A Brazilian beauty shimmies over to them, her headdress bobbing, her smile enormous.  Emma shimmies wildly with her partner, her hair a mess. Mr. and Mrs. Williams clapping wildly and doing the limbo/hustle/drunken parent dance. Guests stomping and cheering. The brown, glittering dancers are shaking thisclose to the drummers who have their shirts off. A dancer rocks with an older gentleman who gulps oxygen from a tank. Rachel and Sidney are bathed in sweat, kissing. Sidney is gulping champagne. Kieran and Kym have their foreheads together and their eyes closed, chests heaving.",

(right on top of him,  No offense, Dad, but you never thought that was a problem for her. I'm kidding. It'll be great to see her. Foodies are the worst, though. They never get it together. There were six of them on my floor in the hospital and you could never get into the bathroom. They would cry at the chocolate pudding and one of them was a guy. I can't wait to see Mom.  Can we stop at the 7/11 please? I feel nauseous. I need something to drink.  I prefer Pepsi from the fountain.  I'll do it, Dad.  Oh my god, you are just mi-nute!  Ow!  I'm fat. Rehab makes you fat. All the vending machines. Look at you, missy! I'd swear to god you were puking again!  Emma! No seriously, you're so tiny it's like you're Asian. Dad wants us to sleep in the same room so you'll be able to watch me while he's asleep and I won't sneak out of the house and blow dealers and shoot heroin.  I told him I'd just sleep in Ethan's room.  Emma, you still have your tiny core of rage! What a relief.  So are you an actual shrink yet? Even though you're like twelve years old?  You should prescribe something soothing for Emma. Like Vicodin.  They do in Guam.    That's so great. I think I heard that. Isn't this your fifth incarnation or something? Weren't you an actress?

Jesus Christ I've been home one day and I can't get a straight answer out of anybody.  I'm talking about Dad offering me food every ten seconds...  No. He has to know where I am and what I'm doing all the time because he has never resolved his own trust issues.  Shut up.  I'd love to but he won't let me. I feel him watching me all the time.

I'm still waiting for the change part.  But as they say, relapse is an almost always inevitable component of recovery, God knows I've got high marks in that mode!  Anyhoo, as more of you know than are likely to admit, one of the actual steps is about making amends.  So I spent a lot of time calling up people who barely remembered me - who barely remembered anything - and apologizing to them for bouncing a check or passing out in the bathtub and flooding their house, or otherwise involving them in sordid activities they were desperately trying to forget. I had to call this one girl who was, I think, fourteen, but I couldn't talk to her because her Mom took out a restraining order.  Anyway, I did a lot of apologizing to people who were practically strangers so I very much want to take this opportunity to not only congratulate my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in matters of the mind, thank you very much, and her adorable, impending husband on the occasion of their unprecedented nuptials.. but also to apologize to my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in matters of the mind, for... Everything! And I really mean that, Rachel. I've been a nightmare and you've been a saint. I'm so damned glad I'm here with you and Sidney and his family and ours, and I am so happy for you guys, I really am. So, I am hereby raising my seltzer in celebration of my laudatory sister and herewith making amends. Sidney, you are robbing our dysfunctional family of one of it's most vital ingredients, and it's only member still willing to lend me money. Enjoy Hawaii. La Chaim.    (to anyone, examining her  What?  I was toasting you and I was making amends. It's one of the Steps. It's important.  Oh, god. Dad?    Christ. I just got here.    I had no idea you were so angry, doctor.    All of you people living in this little world of judgement and paranoia and mistrust. I can feel it every second. At the slightest sign of ingratitude or absence of atonement it's like the freaking Salem Witch Trials around here. I might as well be...  Thank you Carol, for your inevitable pearl of wisdom, but you people are my family. You people make me feel like shit a hundred times a day. You try living under Dad's constant monitoring for five minutes and see how you like it.  \"I'll drive you!\" \"Carol, she's back!\" \"Don't sleep here, sleep there.\" \"Here. Eat this.\" Dad, you're obsessed.  Gee, Rach, sounds like you have some paternal/sibling issues to work through.    Why is this so difficult for you people to understand? It's like you're not happy unless I'm in some kind of desperate situation. You have no idea what to do with me unless I'm desperate. God. Why am I the only one who's willing to say this stuff?  What?  That is so unfair!  Wait! Stop! You can't just drop that tectonic bit of information into a completely separate conversation, Rachel. You can't do that!  Oh, god. Of course I'm happy for you. But you can't tell me when we're talking like this. It's a total set-up!  Dad, will you tell her I'm happy for her?    Of course. Fair enough. I'm off to raid the medicine cabinet.  That was such a set-up.  Ha! She's such an operator. Now I'm the bad guy again. Or still.  Thank you! Otherwise they'd have to pay attention to their own suspicious lives. Nobody actually wants me to actually change, you know. What would they obsess about? I'm like a blessing.  Dad had an actual \"Blueprint for Rehabilitative Success\" at my last intervention. On graph paper. He goes all out with the response, my dad.  Meanwhile an ex-heterosexual ex-boy friend of mine actually rang the door once and tells my mother, \"Kym is sitting in her apartment? With the shades drawn? Doing all this heroin and cocaine? And I think she's going to, like, die?\" And Mom smiles and says \"Thank you\" like he was speaking in Sanskrit.  Exactly! I nodded out into the poached salmon at Dad's wedding two years ago and he told Carol he thought it was jet lag.  What turf?  So?  What are you talking about?  Null. Maybe we should just play Pinball.  Who told you that?  What's Hawaii like?  Uh uh.  Most people say \"my girlfriend lives there\" or \"my wife lives there.\"  Have you had him a long time?  That's a shrink thing, not a genetic thing.  We were in the park. I was sixteen and I was...I had taken all these Percoset. I was unbelievably high.  He had thrown away his shoes- and I was like \"Mom's going to kill me\" because I had no idea where his shoes were- but he was so happy about it. And he had his red socks and he was running around kicking up the leaves. You know in movies where they show a person's high or whatever and the camera careens all around? It was like that. But fun. You know. We were having so much fun. We were leaping around in huge piles of leaves. He buried me. I buried him in a big pile. I was on baby sitting detail. He was pretending he was a train. So he was charging through the leaf pile, making tracks, you know? I was the caboose. And he kept going \"Coal, caboose! Coal caboose!\" So it's time to go and we're driving home and he's in his car seat still demanding coal, and I couldn't focus and I drove off the bridge. The car went into the lake. I couldn't get him out of his car seat. He drowned.  Where are you putting me? In the stockade?    Sandy never called me back after I sent her an amends e-mail from Milestones. I hate it when people don't meet you half way.  (to anyone, her eyes still  Can someone else do it? I was planning on enjoying myself.  Still? God.  That's all I need. Another reason for Grandma Rose to hate me.  She's still mad about that thing at the Rite Aid.  Whatever.  What's the time limit?  Dad!     Mom is handling the flowers?  Got it. Wow. Nurturing and growing things from the soil. Textbook, right?  Yeah, exactly! Candles and rice paper -- all lit up during the ceremony. It's a way of honoring Ethan, Ethan's... spirit, you know? It will look really nice too, mainly. Millions of little candles all over the place, and one huge rice paper candle - representing Ethan - glowing near the couple. That would be you and Sidney.  Geez. It was an IDEA. Lighten up, okay? They do that in Japan or India or someplace, okay?  Oh my god - fine! Done! It was nothing, okay. It was just an idea.  Just a stupid idea. I was joking, you jerk! Lighten up, Rachel. This is your big weekend. Everything's fine.  Are you getting a manicure?  Nooooo.....  Oh. My. God.  I meant to come back. I swear. I even had...Oh god, what was it?  God is punishing me.    We were...at Milestones?  Where did you go after that?    \"The Human Mirror: Seeing With a Fresh Perspective\" Like Secret Santas of despair.  Would you stop?  Don't you think his perspective might be a little skewed?    Ew!... Wait...  I wasn't hurting anybody. No one got hurt, Rach.  Rachel! Rachel?  Thanks for abandoning me. I had to take a taxi!  Why would anything I said or didn't say at the hospital hurt you? It wasn't about you!  God, Rachel...  Oh Jesus Christ. Not by you! It was a long time ago!  No!  It was anonymous! It seemed like a good idea at the time.  Nice, Rachel. Thank you.  You're not worthless. You're my sister. I love you guys. I need you guys, but you don't get to sit around for the rest of my life deciding what I'm supposed to be like. You weren't there. You weren't inside my head when I was fucked up and your certainly not there now. You haven't got a clue what I feel.  Yes! I was stoned out of my mind! Jesus Christ, who do I have to be now? Mother Theresa? Did I use up all the love I'm allowed for this lifetime because I killed our little brother?  I'm sorry! I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry!  Ahhh....  In a minute. I need a glass of water.  When will Andrew be back?  Yes.  Dad was loading the dishwasher...  And I handed him Ethan's bowl with the trains on it by accident.  Why did you leave me in charge of him?  You knew. All of you knew. People told you. I was a junkie.  I was a crazy drug addict. I stole from you. I lied to your face. I weighed six pounds and my hair was falling out. I spent every dinner in the bathroom.  You know what I was. It's not like there weren't any clues. I stayed in my room for days. I passed out all the time. Where were you, Mom! What were you thinking? Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me in charge of him?  Mom?  Mom?  I'm the Maid of Honor.  I hit Mom.  Not with the car.  I have to get dressed.  Dad! I'm fine.  You sent out the cavalry?  I have to get ready. I have to get dressed.  I hit Mom.  No. No.  Okay.    Fine. I had an accident.     Sorry...I'm not sure...  That sucked.  Ouch.    How can you take a break from your own daughter's wedding?  And anyway, she hasn't even done anything all day.  It's so nice here.  Hello?  Why are you going to Washington?  I can't find my cigarettes.    The public is kind of afraid of me.  Have you already talked to Carol about me staying here?  You always said it was stupid.  I've got it. Thanks, Dad. I'll be right back.     Oof. You scared me.  Yeah. I have to go. I was coming to find you.  I was coming to find you. My ride's outside.  If I need to post bond?  Thank you, Kieran.  That would be nice.  I have to go. Bye.  (unbelievably softly and    I love your baby!"

    "description": "Kym Buchman has been in drug rehab for nine months, during which time she has been clean. She is released temporarily from the facility to attend her sister Rachel Buchman's wedding. During her release, Kym is staying at the family home, where the wedding is taking place. As such, it is like Grand Central Station for the duration of Kym's stay, which may not be the most conducive situation for her in constantly being exposed to the watching eyes of those who know and don't yet know her, but know of her situation. The reunion with her family members starts off well enough, but issues around Kym's release from rehab quickly surface. Kym and Rachel's father, Paul Buchman, wants to make sure that Kym is all right at all times, which to Kym feels instead like he doesn't trust her. Rachel slowly begins to resent Kym's situation taking over what is supposed to be the happiest day of her life, some of which is directed by Kym, some of which isn't. One person present but largely not included in the last minute wedding planning work is Kym and Rachel's mother, Abby, from who Paul is divorced. The two have since married other people. Outwardly, Abby has been nurturing of Kym throughout her life. However, what is one of the key moments in Kym's drug induced life, and in their collective family's lives, may profoundly affect the wedding. Beyond how Kym's presence affects the wedding, the goings-on of the family during Kym's short stay may either bring them closer together or tear them apart.—Huggo",
