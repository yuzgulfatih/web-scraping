        "Werner": "On his 35th birthday, I decided to tell Julius Benedict the truth about himself...  It wasn't that he was the product of a scientific experiment.  An experiment designed to produce a physically, mentally and spiritually superior human being. I explained that to him when he was two years old.  And it wasn't the complexity of Julius's parentage. He knew that unlike other little boys, he didn't have just one, but half a dozen fathers, all very distinguished men.                                   *  Nor was it about the extraordinary woman chosen to be his mother...

Vincent is an accident and is somewhat smaller in stature. Vincent is placed in an orphanage while Julius is taken to a South Seas island and raised by philosophers. Vincent becomes the ultimate lowlife and is about to be killed by loan sharks when Julius discovers that he has a brother and begins looking for him.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net>",
