        "Goodspeed": "You owe me five dollars, Marvin.    ACROSS THE ROOM - BILL GOODSPEED, 30, and partner/trainee MARVIN ISHERWOOD, 25, feet up on desks, with toy guns.  This is Man's Boredom. A ceiling fan circles.  Isherwood yawns; scratches neck with his gun barrel.    GOODSPEED reloads.  Aims.  Fires.  THE DART hits A CARDBOARD TARGET across the room which activates a Rube Goldberg series of events ending in a PLASTIC GIRL being ignited in a  Patience, Marvin.  It has its moments.    A KLAXON sounds.  Isherwood smiles excitedly.   Half a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin.  Serbians don't like Bosnians.  Read a newspaper.  It's good for you.  Hold out your hand.    Isherwood does so.  It's shaky.   Coal miners use canaries, we use those. Sorry guys.      July 1, 0.900 hours, agent william Goodspeed and agent/trainee Marvin Isherwood.  Initiating exam of a wooden crate.  Suspicion of seran gas device inside.    Goodspeed grabs a pry-bar from the instrument table-and slowly pries open the cratels wooden lid.  He motions to Isherwood.  Together they gingerly lift the lid.  INSIDE THE CRATE - it's filled with \"UNICEF\" type stuff. Goodspeed lifts out a HOT-PLATE.  Isherwood lifts out an EGG BEATER.  Gocidspeed runs a POISON SENSOR past each.     Appears to be kitchen items, cleaning agents, and... (lifts out a sweatshirt) ... old clothes.    Careful, goddamn it Marvin!    The doll's eyes open.  Its mouth blast a PINKISH SPRAY, hitting Goodspeed's forearm and Isherwood's palm.    OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - DR.  LING stabs a button marked \"exhaust\" and another marked \"emergency.\"    A KLAXON sounds.  F.B.I. TECHNICIANS race for the exit.   IN THE GAS CHAMBER - The pinkish gas hovers in the air. CEILING EXHAUST FANS begin to suck it up.    IN THE GLASS VESSEL - The cockroaches convulse, flip in the air and explode, guts splattering the vessel walls.     I've got some bad news and some really bad news.  The bad news is the gas is corrosive.  It's eating our suits.    ISHERWOOD looks at his RUBBER GLOVES.  The rubber is beginning to bubble and corrode.     Enough C-4 explosive to blow the chamber and enough poison gas to kill everybody in the building.    Isherwood's and Goodspeed's rubber gloves are melting.   Chill, Marvin.   Get that away from me.  I hate needles.      I don't like needles.     A young woman stands in the middle of the living room, belting out a Carlene Carter tune in cowboy boots, rhinestone blouse and skirt.  CARLA PESTALOZZI, 20's, is playing guitar, accompanied by a boom box.    Hey honey.    Not now.   Yeah, somebody's in a bad mood.    Carla changes the c.d.: A PUCCINI OPERA plays.   Much better. She sits with him.  Puts her arm around him.   Had a close one.   Not really.   Could we change the subject?   Hey!  Now there's some good news.   Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed for the Mona Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.  I hope that's a compliment.  I could change my name.  How 'bout Bobby Sue Pestalozzi?  Billy io Pestalozzi?     Stick with Carla.   We've talked about this, Carla, we've talked it up, down, inside and out ...      You're what ... ?  She holds Up a positive home pregnancy test and CUT TO:   Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.    GOODSPEED hangs up.  The couple stares at each other. Carla's seen this look before ...    I've got to go to San Francisco.    I've got to go. She grabs his arm. I can't...  I cannot deal with this right now ...  Bill, I am very Catholic. And very pregnant.  And very unmarried.  Help me with this.   She turns away from him.  He pulls her back...    I love you.  I will marry you.  I just didn't plan on this, that's all.  Tell you what: come to San Francisco.    It's probably just a training exercise. Check into a hotel, order up some champagne, I'll finish up my business and ...    B.A. Columbia.  M.A. and P.H.D., Johns Hopkins, biochemistry and toxicology.    This isn't a training exercise, is it sir.    Why's he going to help us now?     Jesus look at this guy.    INT.  F.B.I. - INTERROGATION ROOM - MORNING Sanchez walks in, sipping coffee.  Mason sits there, eyes forward.    \"I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts.\"      Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.    Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...       Russian poet and dissident exiled to Siberia.     You mind if...  uhm....  I take a shot?     Take his cuffs off.  The Marshal uncuffs Mason's wrists.  MASON rubs his wrists, staring now at Goodspeed.    No actually, I'm Bill Goodspeed.  Mr. Mason, we really need your help.  That's a pardon and release contract from the Attorney Generals office.  It makes you a free man, provided you cooperate.   He slides a ballpoint pen across to Mason.  MASON looks at the pen, then Goodspeed.      I'm a field agent.   I'm a chemical biological weapons expert.    MASON registers this information.... 73 IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Stupid, stupid, stupid ....     Uhm, well, emancipated.  Unfettered.    I don't understand....   Well yes I suppose ...   Yes.  You'll be outside.   A hostage situation.  A matter of life and death.   MASON thinks.  He picks up the pen.    I think we can arrange that.   With that MASON picks up the pen and signs the pardon contract.  He hands it to Goodspeed, who exits.   MASON turns toward the mirror, staring right through.   Sir, that's a legal document.    Sir, those references to Alchimadus, Beckett, Solzhenitsyn: all had something in common.   They were imprisoned for doing nothing wrong.  What's going on, sir?   GOODSPEED watches MASON over Womack's shoulder.     Listen Carla: I'll explain later, but don't come to San Francisco.   CLOSE ON MASON, watching Goodspeed, picking up anything he can from the conversation.     CARLA stands in the threshold of the apartment, watching the answering machine --     I repeat, don't come to San Francisco.     clicks off the phone, thinking, nervous.GOODSPEED notices that MASON is staring at him.    You're on a need to know basis and you don't need to know.    Jesus...  JESUS CHRIST....   GOODSPEED fumbles for his gun.  Finally unholsters it. DIRECTOR WOMACK, hanging below, is SCREAMING.     All units, this is Caretaker.  WE'VE GOT A SIGNAL SIX. Mason's in the elevator!  Let me know where he stops!     exits, looking at MASON getting into the HUMVEE. The Humvee explodes out of the hotel driveway.    GOODSPEED shouts to the F.B.I. AGENTS across the street:   That's him!  The F.B.I. SEDANS ROAR off after Mason.  GOODSPEED looks around.  A Ferrari sitting there. GOODSPEED gets behind the wheel.    THE FERRARI blasts out of the driveway after the Humvee.  EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO - STREETS - DAY The HUMVEE lumbers up to a traffic light.  Stops behind several vehicles ahead.     Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing? HE'S ON THE PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit. Gotta go.    GOODSPEED looks at SPARKLETTS BOTTLES bearing down on him  INT.  S.F. POLICE CRUISER - DAY Two S.F. PATROLMEN.  Their eyes widen too as -- THE SPARKLETTS BOTTLES are bouncing now, roll down on them at 45 m.p.h. A BOTTLE SMASHES through the windshield, showering the Patrolmen with glass.    EXT.  SAN FPANCISCO STPEETS -  - DAY Chaos.  Bottle after bottle smashes down on the -   front-running vehicles.  DENTING HOODS.  SMASHING WINDSHIELDS.  THREE F.B.I. SEDANS and GOODSPEED'S FERRARI negotiate the crashing cars.  They race through the carnage after Mason.   Shit shit SHIT SHIT ...      GOODSPEED grabs the Ferrarils CELLULAR PHONE and tries the door latch. The goddamn airbac is all over him.... So GOODSPEED shoots the fucking air bag.    It's not mine.   Neither is this.   GOODSPEED shoves the kid off the Motorcycle.  Speeds off into traffic. The kid stands there dumbstruck.     Marvin, ring up Wolfburg Federal Pen.  The inmate is Mason, John.   Isherwood gets on the computer.  Starts tapping....     NOT NOW Isherwood.  Go to February 1976.  Who was transferred to Wolfburg from San Quentin that year?    Hit nine nine nine nine.     F.B.I. miss.  Your father is working with us.  He's helping us resolve a....  .... dangerous situation.    Yes madam.  We've got to go, John.  MASON  extends his hand to Jade.  She takes it.    No cuffs until we get to the cars,   They continue toward the waiting cars.    You almost got me killed.  Twice.     It hurts.   SANCHEZ, DIRECTOR WOMACK and the F.B.I. AGENTS approach. Womack's arm is in a sling; he's in a volcanic rage.    looks up from a computer screen generating 3-D images of different angles of a V.X. ROCKET.  He walks over to the table.  Anderson and the other S.E.A.L.s stare at him.    Well, the thermal imaging photos picked up the poison gas. Here.  The prison morgue.  It's probably being kept refrigerated. makes sense.  V.X. gas begins to lose its toxicity at higher temperatures.    No sir, but I've studied them ....     A little, sir.    No sir.  Should I begin the briefing on diffusing and detoxification sir?     Sir, these are very complicated devices...    Sir?    Thank you.   I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, \"Bill, you're too fucking smart for field work.\" Every year I put in for a transfer and every year I sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking Maytag repairman in the commercial.  Then the call finally comes, and it's a whole fuckin, city at stake?  Oh Jesus...     I've got some bad news and some really bad news sir.  Maybe the bad news isn't bad, maybe actually it's good ....     My girlfriend's pregnant.     and MASON, in black dry suits, join COMMANDER ANDERSON and nine other S.E.A.L.s.  Four S.E.A.L.s will be identified: BOYER, REIGERT, DANDO, and SHEPHERD.    Motor oil?   Uhn uhn.  I hate needles.     Wait a minute.  What if this thing crashes ...   Dando looks at Reigert.  They laugh.  This remark they obviously find very funny.  Dando continues buckling GOODSPEED in.     What's going on?   Don' t do it.    We're never gettin off this island.    .... god Jesus we're gonna die   Sanchez, agitated, exits the Command Trailer with Director Womack.  They huddle, speaking in hushed voices.     Don't shoot me. MASON was actually slinging it over his shoulder...   Wait.  Where're you going?    Yes I mind.  I mind very much.    From the tac radio in Mason's hand:   It's me sir.   He says he's leaving the island sir.   He's got a gun, sir.   would you stop.  Just stop.  I don't know whatyou did or why you were sent to jail, but there are a million people across that bay who might die...  Fuck this. Stop.  Freeze.    MASON turns. GOODSPEED has his g gun trained on him.  He's not the most convincing gun handler.   F.B.I. Stop right there.  I really mean it.     Now he has all the guns, sir. .  You've got to help me.  What do you want me to do, beg?    see the wall of flame ROARING toward them.  MASON grabs Goodspeed.     Now what?  MASON moves to the bricked-up wall.  Feels around the mortar.  Smiles. Removes a brick. another.  Another.  A WHOLE CLUMP of bricks falls, revealing A HOLE.     I don't get it.  You're going to help me?   You don't have to get all bent out of shape.    All right, all right.  Don't call me idiot, okay?    MASON what did I do to deserve this?  What God did I offend .....    GOODSPEED begins to wade into the pool.   Something's a little off here: I'm the F.B.I. Agent, you're the convict, and you have all the guns.    MASON slaps the .9 MM pistol into Goodspeed's hand walks off. GOODSPEED follows.     The morgue?    MASON  nods.  Moves to a STEEL-RUNGED LADDER leading to a GARBAGE CHUTE against the wall.  GOODSPEED follows.    You didn't learn that in prison.     I've got some questions for you but they can wait.    GOODSPEED opens the CORPSE DRAWERS revealing the V.X-. CHEM ROUNDS .    GOODSPEED carefully lifts out a chem round.  MASON grabs one, accidentally knocking it against the drawer.    Careful.  The second you don't respect this, it kills you.  GOODSPEED and MASON set the V.X. chem rounds on the mortician's table. GOODSPEED pulls out his EQUIPMENT KIT.  Begins detaching the tops of the chem rounds.    GOODSPEED reaches inside a chem round and carefully pulls out..... a STRAND OF V.X. POISON PEARLS: ping-pong ball sized glass bubbles filled with poison.     I need a hand here.      hands the poison pearl strand to Mason.  MASON  holds it like a string of wind chimes.     Any epidermal exposure or inhalation and you'll know: A twinge at the small of your back as the poison seizes the nervous system.  Then loss of muscular function. Then you spit your guts out, it looks like a tub of spaghettils spilled on the floor, then your skin turns black...    MASON stares uneasily at the pearl strands.    Pier 39 come in.     We're in the morgue.  I'm removing the rocket's guidance system chips.  Without em the rocketslll fly about 500 feet and splash down like a wounded duck.   moves on to the third and fourth chem rounds. Suddenly there's a BEEP. GOODSPEED and MASON whirl.  Pvt. Gamble's WALKIE TALKIE is talking to them:    Shut up; you're making me nervous.    Wait a minute.  Fuck.  Hummel stole fifteen chem rounds. There's only twelve here.  Here.  Quickly.  Do these last four.   MASON raises the poison pearl strands from each of the remaining four chem rounds. GOODSPEED quickly plucks the chips from the guidance systems.   sprinting across floor, BULLETS chewing the floor.  They dive into the MORGUE INCINERATOR CHUTE, GOODSPEED leaving the tac radio behind ....     duck as the GRENADE PROJECTILE wings over their heads, continues down the tunnel and DETONATES against the tunnel wall.    CART 1 roars through smoke and debris left by grenade explosion.  As it rounds a corner, MASON grabs A SPLINTERED TIMBER and releases from the cart.  CART 1, with GOODSPEED alone continues down the mono-rail.    MASON  yanks down a 5 ft. long BROKEN SECTION OF SEWAGE PIPE and presses himself against the tunnel wall.    AS CART 2 rounds the corner...  WHAM!!  MASON  swings, hitting Scarpetti flush in the forehead, killing him and blowing him off the cart.  Cart 2, without Scarpetti, continues down the mono-rail.    MASON  waits.  As CART 3 rounds the corner  MASON  swings again But Hendrix is waiting for it. Hendrix grabs the swinging pipe and pulls MASON into Cart 3!     looks over his shoulder at MASON and Hendrix locked in mortal combat.  He pulls the CART BRAKE.  Cart 1 begins slowing down.  CART 2  rams into it. Now Carts 1 and 2 are together.  And on comes --  CART 3 - Hendrix knocks MASON to the floor of the cart.  Hendrix dives atop Mason, strangling him. mason's head is bent over the front lip of the cart.  MASON looks down the mono-rail track.  To his horror he sees CARTS 1 and 2 slowing down ...   realizes that his cart is going to ram Mason's outstretched head.  He releases the brake, and Cart 1 picks up speed ...  IN CART 3 - Hendrix draws the knife.  Hendrix raises the knife.  With his last strength, MASON rolls away.  Hendrix plunges the knife down, missing Mason, him momentum carrying his head and shoulders over the front lip of the cart.  MASON SCREAMS at Goodspeed.   pulls the cart brake and --  -- CART 3 SLAMS into CARTS 1 and 2 at 20 m.p.h., crushing Hendrixls head and torso between Carts 2 and 3.   The collision knocks MASON off Cart 3, SLAMMING his head against the tunnel wall.  MASON  falls unconscious.to the tunnel floor, while --   -- CART 1 is shoved by the collision across.a DITCH OF WATER in the tunnel floor. GOODSPEED groggily gets to his feet. Jumps down from the cart.    Mason!  In the midst of this PVT.  ROYCE runs up.  Sees MASON concussed, helpless.  Royce draws his GLINTING KNIFE.  Kneels over Mason.  He's going to cut his throat.    Wait.  Royce lowers the knife.  Looks across the ditch at Goodspeed.  The ditch is 20 ft. wide and filled with dank, stagnant water and we've seen dank, stagnant water before.     Pretty easy killing an unconscious man. How about trying me? Punk.  What're you waiting for?  Limp dick.   I rolled snake-eyes.  Shithead.    Goodspeed, hand over hand on the monorail, eases the cart across the stagnant ditch.  Hops out.  MASON gets to his feet.  The two exchange a look.     It's all I could think of.    They stumble off down the mono-rail tunnel.   He thinks we're Seals.    I'll go.   What, vou?   Good point.  Okay here, take 'em.   GOODSPEED unpockets the V.X. ROCKET'S GUIDANCE CHIPS.  Hands them to Mason.  MASON heaves them into the bushes.     What are you doing?   What about Mr. Henderson?     Wait.   I... I don't know if I can do this.     Well thank-you, thank-you very much.    GOODSPEED creeps toward the China Alley rocket launcher.    Freeze.  Drop the weapon and turn around. Slowly.    Pvt.  Cox drops his weapon.  Slowly turns.  Goodspeed, one hand on his gun, the other on HIS TOOLS, begins to unscrew the V.X. CHEM ROUND  - PVT.  MCCOY appears. Looking down, he sees GOODSPEED and Cox.  He cinches his REPELLING CLIP to the steel railing.     Mason.  Mason?   Where are you?    MASON  sits on a bed.   This is tiny.    The cell, Mason.    I only got one chem round.  There are two left.  I fucked up.    I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.   What is your beef with the Bureau, anyway Clmon.  Tell me.    How?     GOODSPEED stares blankly into space.  INTERCUT between the two cells again.     Jesus.  Why didn't you just tell Hoover and the bureau where the microfilm was?  Make a trade?     I see your point.  Something's been on my mind.  About your escape.     You went down the shower drain, through the tunnels to the power plant, under the steam engine and out through the intake pipe - that much I've got ' But... howld you get out of your cell?   MASON leans out his cell and tosses the rolling caster down the cell block.  The braided rope, tied to it, plays out to it's full length.      I only ask because, in our current situation, it might be useful information ...    The result: the braided rope lies across the cell block floor, the rolling caster tied to it.  MASON  holds the other end of the rope through the bars of his cell.   GOODSPEED hears the doors opening above him.   Hey!  Hey what's happening?  Mason.  Mason?   Suddenly Goodspeed's cell door opens. GOODSPEED exits the cell.  MASON stands there.     Shit....   grabs his guns and gear and follows after Mason. 225  EXT.  ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - MORNING Hummel sits behind the desk.  Baxter, Frye, Darrow, Hendrix in front of him. Silence.  Hummel stares at his phone.  The tension is palpable.    Mason.  John.  What happened - the injustice done to you - doesn't mean you can walk away from this.  A million people across that Bay will die.     You were once a different man.     You were a civil servant.  Sworn to do your duty.  Just like me.    MASON  begins climbing down to the waterline.   You'll never make it.    Fine.  I'll fuckin, do it myself.     That change things?   Partners?   and MASON  exchange a tense look. mason aims his gun through the slit ...  HUMMEL draws his .45 but Baxter fires first, hitting Hummel squarely in the chest.    grabs the semi-consious Hummel and drags him down the corridor-.    drags Hummel inside. Hummel collapses against the wall.  His blood runs across the tiled floor.  MASON takes a defensive position in the washrooms doorway.   DARROW AND FRYE attack through the infirmary's maze of rooms, taking cover where they can, squeezing off rounds.  MASON fires at Darrow and Frye from the doorway while GOODSPEED kneels over Hummel.  Hummells dying and knows it. he stares at Goodspeed through glassy eyes.    It's not too late, General.  Tell me where the last chem round is.     Don't ...   shoots Crisp.  Crisp falls dead. A255 INT.  INFIRMARY -  You shoot me, I'll drop this and we're both dead.  One of these pearlslll kill everything within 200 feet.  You know how this shit works?   Darrow drops his gun.  Pulls out a TITANIUM BLADED KNIFG.   You know the Elton John son, \"Rocket Man\"?    Well it happens to be my favorite fuckin, song!     emerges on the roof.  Sets down the chem round.  Pulls out the POISON PEARL STRANDS, his hand shaking.  With the other hand, he unclips the ROCKET GUIDANCE CHIP.    The COPPER STRANDS holding the pearls are corroded.  A strand BREAKS. Four PEARLS fall. GOODSPEED catches three.  The FOURTH drops, hitting his SHOE.  It rolls along the rooftop. GOODSPEED sets aside the other pearls and dives, grabbing the stray pearl an inch from the roof,s edge.    Suddenly THE HUGE LIGHTHOUSE WINDOW behind GOODSPEED EXPLODES, showering GOODSPEED with glass.    ON THE ADJACENT ROOFTOP ~ PVT.  MCCOY, wielding a smoking .60 Cal MACHINE GUN.  McCoy fires a wicked, long, sustained burst, emptyinc his entire ammunition belt.   THE LIGHTHOUSE SEARCHLIGHT FRESNEL blows to shreds. GOODSPEED rolls away, GLASS SHARDS raining down on him, cutting him-. He's a sitting duck.    MCCOY casts aside the .60 Cal and unshoulders a SNIPER RIFLE.  Draws a bead on GOODSPEED again.  GOODSPEED, bleeding, terrified, cowers, awaiting death.   A SILHOUETTE APPEARES behind McCoy.  It's MASON, dirty and bloodied. McCoy spins.  MASON bats the rifle aside, KNEES McCoy in the solar plexus, grips McCoyls NECK -- SNAP! -and HURLS him off the roof.  McCoy falls 5 floors.    GOODSPEED gives MASON a thankful glance.  And hears THE DOOR BURST OPEN  exits and kneels, reaching for HIS OTHER PANTLEG.  PUllS out his GREEN FLARES.  He cracks the flares and fires them up.            Pier 39 come in.  Pier 39  ...  My god he's alive.    Director Womack grabs the mike.    Every one of em sir.    Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.   Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon contract you signed?   You knew?  All this time?   All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.   God's speed.   What's that?  Mason?  GOODSPEED turns around.  John Paul MASON  is gone.   Neither did I sir.   Vaporized, sir.  Blown out to sea.    He saved my life, sir. Is SANCHEZ  going to accept this? .   Bill Goodspeed, Mr. President.   Thank you, Mr. President.  The man you should be thanking is John Mason.   Director Womack.  GOODSPEED hands the phone to Womack.  Womack looks at the phone.  Slowly takes it.     You want to know who really killed President Kennedy, honey...?",
        "Commander": "A precision night drop is out due to the full moon. Likewise on a frontal, seaside attack: at the first shot, Hummel might launch.  My second in command is working on an attack from within the prison.  The idea is to penetrate the tunnels under the prison, undetected, emerge in its center, and jump the marines from behind - take their rocket positions without a shot fired.  But I need better intelligence.    They're useless.  Alcatraz was originally a Civil War fort.  It's been ripped up and rebuilt for years.  Under there is a maze of shit, excuse my language.  What I need is personal, firsthand intelligence on the island's tunnels.   CAMERA FOCUSES ON F.B.I. Director Womack, who gives a very significant look to C.I.A. Director AMWAY.    Okay, one more time: down this second fork fifty-seven paces to a septic chamber.  Turn left at the water pump, then forty-two paces to the prison showers ...     That's not what you said three minutes ago.      Excuse me.  Womack.   Womack follows Anderson aside.  They confer heatedly.    I ask for someone with knowledge of the island's tunnels. you give me a fuckin, convict who wants to play \"twenty questions.\"    Then he's keeping it to himself.  He's fucking with me and I don't have the time.     Out of the question.  He'll endanger the mission - he'll endanger my men.  He's a security risk.  Who says he won't bolt as soon as we turn our backs on him?   The goal is to take out the launchers and neutralize the V.X.chem rounds, Goodspeed.  Tell us what you know.    Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?    That's great, Goodspeed.  You're in the Bureau, so you've had weapons training.    So you've never been in a combat situation.     Won't be necessary.    I know they are, Goodspeed.  That's why you're going with us.     Get him some gear.  MASON stares at Goodspeed.   Listen up, men.  Mr. MASON here will run point for us.  Lieutenant Shepherd will be attached to your hip, Mason.  You breath, he breathes with you.  Understand?   LIEUTENANT SHEPHERD, young, laconic, nods at Mason.    Shep, what's the status on the special operational gear for Mason.     GOODSPEED here's our specialist.  We will cover him while he neutralizes the' chemical threat.  If he does his job we'll launch flares and hold our position 'till the cavalry comes.  Make no mistake about it, gentlemen, we are going in against an entrenched force led by one hot-shit field commander.  We are in the fight of our lives, I bullshit you not.  Any questions?  Let's move out.   The move across the staging area to --  A CH-53 SEA STALLION and two HUEY COBRA ATTACK GUNSHIPS, their BLADES whipping with ferocity.   S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD stands in the Sea Stallion's door.  The S.E.A.L.s board past him.  Last are MASON and Goodspeed.     Activate mini-cams.   Anderson, Boyer and the other S.E.A.L.s flip on TINY VIDEOCAMERAS mounted on their shoulders.  A NAVAL MEDIC passes out SYRINGES OF ATROPINE in ANKLE SHFATHES.    You know what you're doing?    Prepare to deplore!    Thank-you very fucking much, Mr. Mason, you've led us to a room with no exit.     No time for the torch.  Explosives'll bring the fucking world down on us.

Sir, we know why you're out here.  God knows I agree with you sir, but like you sir, I swore to defend this country against all enemies.  Foreign, sir, and domestic.

You men following the General: You are United States Marines and under oath you forgotten that?  We all have shipmates we remember - some of 'em were shit on and spit on by the Pentagon - that doesn't give you the right to mutiny.",
        "Anderson": "A precision night drop is out due to the full moon. Likewise on a frontal, seaside attack: at the first shot, Hummel might launch.  My second in command is working on an attack from within the prison.  The idea is to penetrate the tunnels under the prison, undetected, emerge in its center, and jump the marines from behind - take their rocket positions without a shot fired.  But I need better intelligence.    They're useless.  Alcatraz was originally a Civil War fort.  It's been ripped up and rebuilt for years.  Under there is a maze of shit, excuse my language.  What I need is personal, firsthand intelligence on the island's tunnels.   CAMERA FOCUSES ON F.B.I. Director Womack, who gives a very significant look to C.I.A. Director AMWAY.    Okay, one more time: down this second fork fifty-seven paces to a septic chamber.  Turn left at the water pump, then forty-two paces to the prison showers ...     That's not what you said three minutes ago.      Excuse me.  Womack.   Womack follows Anderson aside.  They confer heatedly.    I ask for someone with knowledge of the island's tunnels. you give me a fuckin, convict who wants to play \"twenty questions.\"    Then he's keeping it to himself.  He's fucking with me and I don't have the time.     Out of the question.  He'll endanger the mission - he'll endanger my men.  He's a security risk.  Who says he won't bolt as soon as we turn our backs on him?   The goal is to take out the launchers and neutralize the V.X.chem rounds, Goodspeed.  Tell us what you know.    Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?    That's great, Goodspeed.  You're in the Bureau, so you've had weapons training.    So you've never been in a combat situation.     Won't be necessary.    I know they are, Goodspeed.  That's why you're going with us.     Get him some gear.  MASON stares at Goodspeed.   Listen up, men.  Mr. MASON here will run point for us.  Lieutenant Shepherd will be attached to your hip, Mason.  You breath, he breathes with you.  Understand?   LIEUTENANT SHEPHERD, young, laconic, nods at Mason.    Shep, what's the status on the special operational gear for Mason.     GOODSPEED here's our specialist.  We will cover him while he neutralizes the' chemical threat.  If he does his job we'll launch flares and hold our position 'till the cavalry comes.  Make no mistake about it, gentlemen, we are going in against an entrenched force led by one hot-shit field commander.  We are in the fight of our lives, I bullshit you not.  Any questions?  Let's move out.   The move across the staging area to --  A CH-53 SEA STALLION and two HUEY COBRA ATTACK GUNSHIPS, their BLADES whipping with ferocity.   S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD stands in the Sea Stallion's door.  The S.E.A.L.s board past him.  Last are MASON and Goodspeed.     Activate mini-cams.   Anderson, Boyer and the other S.E.A.L.s flip on TINY VIDEOCAMERAS mounted on their shoulders.  A NAVAL MEDIC passes out SYRINGES OF ATROPINE in ANKLE SHFATHES.    You know what you're doing?    Prepare to deplore!    Thank-you very fucking much, Mr. Mason, you've led us to a room with no exit.     No time for the torch.  Explosives'll bring the fucking world down on us.  An idea, please, we're tight on time.     You do not look like Jesus Christ, Mr. Mason, so I'm having a hard time how you're going to accomplish that.    You are shitting me.

    "description": "Stanley Goodspeed, who lives in Washington, D.C., is a biochemist who works for the F.B.I. Soon after his fiancée Carla Pestalozzi announces that she is pregnant, Stanley gets a call from F.B.I. Director James Womack. Womack tells Stanley that San Francisco's Alcatraz Island has been taken hostage, along with eighty-one tourists, by Marine General Francis Xavier Hummel who, for years, has been protesting the government's refusal to pay benefits to families of war veterans who died during covert military operations. The death of his wife Barbara on March 9, 1995 drove General Hummel over the edge, and now he's holding hostages in order to get his point across. Stanley is needed because General Hummel has stolen some VX gas warheads and has announced that he will launch them onto San Francisco unless his demands are met. Stanley knows how to disarm the bombs, but he needs someone who knows Alcatraz well enough to get him inside. That man is former British Intelligence Agent John Patrick Mason, who has been in prison for the past thirty years without a trial because he was accused of stealing the private files ofJ. Edgar Hoover. In 1962, John became the only inmate ever to escape from Alcatraz, and he stayed out of Alcatraz long enough to father a daughter named Jade Angelou. Despite his extreme hatred of the F.B.I., John agrees to help Stanley. When John and Stanley are sent into Alcatraz with a Navy S.E.A.L. team, General Hummel's men kill the entire S.E.A.L. team, leaving Stanley and John to work on their own to rescue the hostages.—Todd Baldridge",
